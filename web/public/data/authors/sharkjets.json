Covers enemy behaviors, NPC logic, companion AI, stealth systems, behavior trees, dynamic difficulty, and more — for any engine and any genre.\n\n## Skills\n\n### ai-design\n\nActivates a game AI design advisor that evaluates your work against 10 gameplay-first principles. Covers the full range of game AI problems: from high-level architecture to concrete implementation patterns.\n\nUse this when you're designing a new AI system, reviewing existing behavior, debugging why enemies feel cheap or dumb, or brainstorming how to make encounters more satisfying.\n\n**How to invoke:**\n\n```\nUse the ai-design skill\n\n[describe your AI system, share code, or just explain the problem]\n```\n\nOr just describe the problem naturally — the skill triggers on any game AI topic:\n\n```\nMy enemies feel too easy to cheese. Players just crouch in a corner and\nheadshot everyone. How do I fix this without making the game unfair?\n```\n\n**When it activates:**\n\nThe skill triggers on any of the following — including tangential phrasing:\n\n- Designing or implementing: enemy AI, NPC logic, companion AI, stealth systems, combat AI\n- Architecture: behavior trees, state machines, GOAP planners, utility AI\n- Systems: dynamic difficulty, AI directors, faction systems, creature ecosystems\n- Player feedback: \"enemies feel dumb,\" \"players are cheesing my AI,\" \"guards don't react to noise\"\n- Friendlies: companion behavior, ally pathfinding, squad coordination\n\nApplies to Unity, Unreal, Godot, and custom engines.\n\n**The advisor evaluates your work against 10 principles:**\n\n1. **Align aggressiveness with the core experience** — AI intensity should reinforce the game's fantasy, not fight it\n2. **Let the player \"cheat\" subtly** — grace periods, attacker limits, near-miss mechanics\n3. **Telegraph AI intentions clearly** — barks, animations, UI indicators before every significant action\n4. **Prioritize consistency over unpredictability** — deterministic triggers, varied execution\n5. **Integrate AI with broader game systems** — enemies pick up weapons, use hazards, react to the world\n6. **React and adapt to player habits** — counter dominant strategies visibly, not punitively\n7. **Manage pacing and tension dynamically** — waves of intensity and release, not constant pressure\n8. **Give AI independent goals** — schedules, factions, survival needs; not just \"find and kill player\"\n9. **Design better friendlies** — narrative enhancement over combat effectiveness; never babysitting\n10. **Remember: AI is a design tool** — always ask if the change makes encounters more fun\n\n**Bundled references:**\n\n- `references/patterns.md` — Implementation patterns for 8 common AI systems (pseudocode, engine-agnostic)\n\n## Implementation Patterns\n\nThe skill references `references/patterns.md` when you need actual code or architecture guidance. It contains engine-agnostic pseudocode patterns for:\n\n| Pattern | Problem It Solves |\n| --- | --- |\n| Simultaneous Attacker Limiter | Players feel overwhelmed unfairly when too many enemies engage at once |\n| Detection Grace Period | Instant detection feels cheap; player has no time to react |\n| AI Bark / Telegraph System | AI makes smart decisions but the player never knows it |\n| Player Habit Tracker | One dominant strategy trivializes the game |\n| Dynamic Tension Director | Constant intensity leads to fatigue, not excitement |\n| Consistent-but-Varied Response | Predictable AI is exploitable; random AI is unfair |\n| Independent AI Schedule System | Enemies feel like they exist only to fight the player |\n| Behavior Tree Template | Minimal, well-structured BT skeleton incorporating all principles |\n\n## Design Principle Quick Reference\n\n**The core rule:** A game enemy's real job is not to kill the player. It is to present interesting gameplay.\n\n**When reviewing AI code, check for:**\n\n- Missing telegraphs — does the player see the AI's decision before it lands?\n- Missing player-favoring biases — grace periods, attacker limits, near-miss shots?\n- Overly random behaviors — can the player form a mental model and make a plan?\n- AI that ignores the world — does it interact with pickups, hazards, environment?\n- No pacing modulation — does intensity ever release, or is it constant pressure?\n\n**When writing AI code:**\n\nInclude design-aware comments — not just what the code does, but why it exists from a gameplay perspective. Always include a TODO for the telegraph/feedback layer; it's the most commonly forgotten piece.\n\n**When brainstorming:**\n\nStart from the player experience and work backward:\n1. What should this encounter **feel** like?\n2. What AI behaviors create that feeling?\n3. What systems support those behaviors?\n4. What technical implementation do those systems need?\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add sharkjets/claude-plugins\n/plugin install ai-rubric@sharkjets\n```\n\n## Updating\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update .\n```\n\n\n\n## Version\n\n1.0.0\n",

Your job is to make the most effective strategy and the most fun strategy the same thing.\n\n**When reviewing reward/penalty code, check for:**\n\n- Penalties that could be reframed as rewards for the opposite behavior\n- Resources that incentivize the wrong playstyle (health from cover → encourages camping)\n- Hard fail states that could be replaced with soft discouragement\n- Grading that rewards the wrong behaviors (or doesn't reward the right ones)\n- System depth mismatches — deep combat in a stealth game signals \"go loud\"\n\n**When writing reward systems:**\n\nAlways ask: \"Can I flip this penalty into a reward for the opposite behavior?\" Grade on the behaviors you want to see, make the grade visible during play, and never make it a gate — it's a carrot, not a stick.\n\n**When a playtest reveals degenerate strategies:**\n\nDon't patch the symptom — diagnose the incentive.

Design engagement through craft, not compulsion.\n\n**When reviewing engagement systems, check for:**\n\n- Novelty front-loading — does the game introduce everything in hour one and coast?\n- No forward pull — does the player have something to wonder about or look forward to?\n- Sustained intensity — has there been a tension release in the last 5 minutes?\n- Goal gaps — can the player always answer \"what am I doing right now\" and \"what am I working toward\"?\n- Dark pattern drift — does any system create anxiety about *not* playing?\n\n**When designing retention systems:**\n\nAlways ask: \"Would the player thank me for this system if they understood exactly how it works?\" If the answer is no — if it works by creating anxiety, exploiting loss aversion, or manufacturing obligation — redesign it. The goal is players who *want* to return, not players who feel they *have* to.\n\n**When a playtest reveals drop-off:**\n\nDon't patch the symptom — diagnose the layer:\n1. Is the pacing wrong? (Pillar fatigue, sustained intensity, no recovery beats)\n2. Is novelty exhausted? (No new enemies, mechanics, environments, or story beats)\n3. Are goals unclear? (Player can't answer what to do next or what they're building toward)\n4. Is challenge mistuned?

Covers root cause analysis, lever identification, creative reframing, second-order effect tracing, and playtesting methodology — for any engine and any genre.\n\nBased on proven methodology from Bungie (Halo), Epic (Gears of War), Yacht Club (Shovel Knight), Ubisoft (Rainbow Six Siege), and Nintendo.\n\n## Skills\n\n### game-design-problem-solving\n\nActivates a game design problem-solving advisor that helps you find root causes before jumping to solutions. Evaluates your thinking against the core principle: **don't fix the symptom — fix the cause.**\n\nUse this when something in your game feels wrong but you're not sure why, when balance changes keep creating new problems, when playtests surface complaints you can't diagnose, or when you're stuck making 5% tweaks that never quite fix anything.\n\n**How to invoke:**\n\n```\nUse the game-design-problem-solving skill\n\n[describe the problem, complaint, or symptom — share code, design docs, or just explain what players are saying]\n```\n\nOr just describe the problem naturally — the skill triggers on any game design diagnosis or iteration topic:\n\n```\nPlayers say the sniper is overpowered but every time I nerf it I break\nsomething else. I've been tuning it for two weeks and nothing feels right.\n```\n\n**When it activates:**\n\nThe skill triggers on any of the following — including tangential phrasing:\n\n- Balance problems: \"weapon is OP,\" \"ability is broken,\" \"nerf/buff,\" \"players complain about X\"\n- Feel problems: \"doesn't feel right,\" \"feels clunky,\" \"feels punitive,\" \"feels unfair\"\n- Iteration problems: \"I've been tweaking this for weeks,\" \"nothing is working,\" \"every fix breaks something\"\n- Playtesting problems: \"players keep doing the wrong thing,\" \"playtesters all got stuck at the same point\"\n- Scope/variety problems: \"I need more content but I'm out of budget,\" \"the mid-game is empty\"\n- Design methodology: \"how do I balance,\" \"how do I know if my fix worked,\" \"how do I run a playtest\"\n\nApplies to Unity, Unreal, Godot, and custom engines.\n\n**The advisor applies 5-step methodology:**\n\n1. **Identify the root cause** — ask \"why\" three times before proposing any solution; align on problem scope before debating fixes\n2. **Map and pull the right levers** — separate identity levers (off-limits) from secondary levers (safe to adjust); pull hard, not cautiously\n3. **Reframe creatively** — flip penalties into risk/reward choices; pull systems out of menus and into the world; find solutions that solve multiple problems at once\n4. **Design for how players actually behave** — use invisible assistance to bridge the skill gap; trace second-order effects before shipping any change\n5. **Validate without bias** — blind playtests with identical instructions; read behavior before asking questions; distinguish invisible fixes from overcorrections\n\n**Bundled references:**\n\n- `references/methodology.md` — 8 structured frameworks with worksheets and worked examples (pseudocode, engine-agnostic)\n\n## Frameworks\n\nThe skill references `references/methodology.md` when you need a structured approach or concrete template. It contains:\n\n| Framework | Use When |\n| --- | --- |\n| Root Cause Analysis | A complaint has surfaced and you need to find what's actually wrong before proposing anything |\n| Lever Identification Worksheet | You know the problem and need to figure out what you can safely change without destroying identity |\n| Dramatic Iteration Protocol | You're stuck in the 5% tweak trap and can't tell if you're heading in the right direction |\n| Reframing Toolkit | The obvious solution feels punitive, unintuitive, or only solves one thing |\n| Second-Order Effect Mapper | You're about to ship a balance change and need to trace ripple effects first |\n| Hidden Buff Designer | Playtest data shows beginners struggling while experts are fine |\n| Constraint-Driven Design Generator | You need more content or variety but have limited art, engineering, or time budget |\n| Blind Playtest Protocol | You've implemented a fix and need to verify it actually worked |\n\n## Design Principle Quick Reference\n\n**The core rule:** Don't fix the symptom — fix the cause. When players say \"X feels bad,\" that's a symptom. Proposing solutions before diagnosing causes is how balance changes break five things while fixing one.\n\n**When reviewing a balance complaint, check:**\n\n- Is this a system issue (the economy is broken) or a feel issue (this one attack doesn't feel good)? These need completely different solutions.\n- Are you touching an identity lever (what makes this thing *this thing*) or a secondary lever (adjustable without losing identity)?\n- Have you traced the second-order effects? A weapon nerf can shift the meta, unbalance team compositions, and invalidate a quest reward.\n- Can you reframe the solution — flip a penalty into a risk/reward choice, or pull it out of a menu and into the world?\n\n**When playtests reveal a recurring problem:**\n\n1. Restate the problem as you understand it — get agreement before proposing anything\n2. Ask \"why\" at least three times to reach something actionable\n3. Map the levers: what's off-limits (identity), what's safe (secondary), what's in adjacent systems (contextual)\n4. Make a dramatic change first — halve it or double it — to confirm you're pulling the right lever\n5. Blind-playtest the fix; if testers don't mention the change, it worked\n\n**When scope or variety is the problem:**\n\nConstraints are creative forcing functions. Invisible enemies cost zero art budget. Reskinned hybrids reuse existing animations with new behavior trees. Level remixes (backward, night variant, flooded, timed) cost a fraction of new levels.

Just ask naturally:\n\n- \"Design a puzzle using my portal mechanic\"\n- \"Players keep getting stuck on level 7\"\n- \"How do I order these 20 puzzles into a good curve?\"\n- \"This puzzle feels unfair, help me fix it\"\n- \"I have a gravity-flip mechanic, what puzzles can I make?\"\n- \"How do I teach this mechanic without a tutorial popup?\"\n\nOr invoke directly: `/puzzle-design`\n\n## The Full Stack\n\n| Plugin | Layer | Focus |\n|---|---|---|\n| **gamedev-mentor** | Entry Point | How to *surface* design problems across all domains |\n| **ai-design** (ai-rubric) | Moment-to-moment | How enemies *behave* |\n| **combat-design** | Moment-to-moment | How combat *feels* and plays |\n| **player-protection-design** (player-protection) | Per-encounter | How mechanics *incentivize* fun play |\n| **ethical-engagement-design** | Session-level | How the experience *sustains engagement* |\n| **game-design-problem-solving** | Meta / Process | How to *diagnose and fix* design issues |\n| **puzzle-design** | Content / Level | How to *craft puzzles* that produce eureka moments |\n\n## Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `SKILL.md` | Core skill — 6 design principles + application guidance |\n| `references/frameworks.md` | 8 frameworks: construction process, catch/revelation templates, misdirection patterns, minimalism audit, feedback checklist, difficulty quantification, curve planner, playtesting protocol |\n\n## Principles Covered\n\n1. Establish your foundation (ironclad rules, clear goals)\n2. Design the catch and revelation (logical contradiction → eureka)\n3. Use misdirection and assumptions (productive wrong answers)\n4. Refine presentation and feedback (minimalism, clarity, failure legibility)\n5. Structure the difficulty curve (vertical building, quantified ordering)\n6. Iterate and test (observation-based playtesting, \"smart\" vs \"tricked\")\n",
        "plugins/gamedev-mentor/README.md": "# gamedev-mentor Plugin\n\nA higher-level entry point into game design mentorship. Rather than activating when you're already working in a specific domain, this plugin surfaces design problems you may not know you have — through codebase review or structured consultation.\n\n## Skills\n\n### mentor-review\n\nReads your game codebase and produces a structured design audit. Identifies which design domains are relevant to your game type, reads key files, flags violations against domain principles, and delivers a report with file:line references and prioritized recommendations.\n\n**Use when:** You want an objective audit of your existing project — \"what design problems does my code reveal?\"\n\n**How to invoke:**\n\n```\n/mentor-review path/to/your/project\n```\n\nOr describe the task naturally:\n\n```\nReview my game project at src/ for design problems\n```\n\n**What it audits:**\n\n| Domain | What it looks for |\n|---|---|\n| AI Behavior | Telegraph gaps, player-favoring biases, consistency, world integration |\n| Combat Feel | Hit stop, animation phases, defensive options, enemy readability, stunlock |\n| Player Incentives | Optimal vs. intended behavior, push-forward design, reward timing |\n| Engagement & Pacing | Novelty curve, session loop structure, return motivation, dark patterns |\n| Puzzle Design | Catch-first structure, hint availability, misdirection, failure feedback |\n\n**Report format:**\n\n- Executive summary with top 3 findings\n- Domain-by-domain findings with severity (CRITICAL / NOTABLE / MINOR) and file:line references\n- Recommended next steps\n- Specialist plugin recommendations for deep implementation help\n\n---\n\n### mentor-consult\n\nRuns a structured intake interview, then diagnoses your top design problems with expert analysis. No code required — works from your description of the game.\n\n**Use when:** You want guided feedback on your design without sharing code, or you're not sure what's wrong and need help figuring it out.\n\n**How to invoke:**\n\n```\n/mentor-consult\n```\n\nOr describe the need naturally:\n\n```\nHelp me figure out what's wrong with my game's design\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Intake** — Four questions asked together: game type, core loop, biggest problem, what success feels like\n2. **Domain probes** — Targeted follow-up questions for domains relevant to your game type (skips irrelevant domains)\n3. **Diagnosis** — Top 3–5 design problems, each mapped to the principle it violates and explained in terms of player-facing impact\n4. **Recommendations** — Concrete, specific actions with real-game examples; closes with specialist plugin suggestions\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add sharkjets/claude-plugins\n/plugin install gamedev-mentor@sharkjets\n```\n\n## Updating\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update .\n```\n\n\n\n## Specialist Plugins\n\nThis plugin surfaces problems and points you toward solutions.
