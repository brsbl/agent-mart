One install gives you a senior game design mentor plus six specialist skills covering every major domain of game design.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add sharkjets/claude-plugins\n/plugin install gamedev-mentor@sharkjets\n```\n\n## Updating\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update .\n```\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\n### Entry Points\n\nStart here if you're unsure what you need.\n\n**`/mentor-review [path/to/project]`**\n\nReads your actual game code and audits it against design principles across all domains. Produces severity-ranked findings (CRITICAL / NOTABLE / MINOR) with file:line references and prioritized next steps.\n\n```\n/mentor-review src/\n```\n\n| Domain | What it looks for |\n|---|---|\n| AI Behavior | Telegraph gaps, player-favoring biases, consistency, world integration |\n| Combat Feel | Hit stop, animation phases, defensive options, enemy readability, stunlock |\n| Player Incentives | Optimal vs. intended behavior, push-forward design, reward timing |\n| Engagement & Pacing | Novelty curve, session loop structure, return motivation, dark patterns |\n| Puzzle Design | Catch-first structure, hint availability, misdirection, failure feedback |\n\n---\n\n**`/mentor-consult`**\n\nStructured interview — no code required. Diagnoses design problems through conversation. Identifies root causes, maps them to principles, gives concrete recommendations with real-game examples.\n\n```\n/mentor-consult\n```\n\nHow it works:\n1. **Intake** — Four questions: game type, core loop, biggest problem, what success feels like\n2. **Domain probes** — Targeted follow-ups for relevant domains only\n3. **Diagnosis** — Top 3–5 problems mapped to violated principles and player-facing impact\n4. **Recommendations** — Specific, actionable changes with real-game examples\n\n---\n\n### Specialist Skills\n\nUse these for deep implementation guidance after the mentor identifies problem areas.\n\n**`/ai-design`**\nEnemy behaviors, NPC logic, behavior trees, dynamic difficulty, telegraphing, attacker limits, player-favoring biases.\n\n**`/combat-design`**\nMelee combat feel, attack animation phases (startup / active / recovery), hit stop, screen shake, defensive mechanics, combo structure.\n\n**`/player-protection-design`**\nPlayer incentives, reward timing, push-forward mechanics, optimal vs. intended strategy alignment, soft discouragement.\n\n**`/ethical-engagement-design`**\nPacing, novelty curves, session loop structure (30s / 5min / 30min), flow state, onboarding, dark pattern avoidance.\n\n**`/game-design-problem-solving`**\nRoot cause analysis, lever management, creative reframing, second-order effects, playtesting methodology.\n\n**`/puzzle-design`**\nCatch and revelation structure, hint systems, misdirection, minimalism, failure feedback, difficulty curves.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Start with `/mentor-review` (if you have code) or `/mentor-consult` (if you want a conversation).\n2. The mentor identifies which domains have problems.\n3. Follow up with the relevant specialist skill for deep implementation guidance.\n\n## Version\n\n1.0.0\n"
