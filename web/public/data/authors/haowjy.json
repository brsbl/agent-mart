        "README.md": "# Creative Writing Skills\n\nA comprehensive creative writing assistant for Claude Code and Claude.ai. This plugin provides six specialized skills to help you write prose in your personal style, capture brainstorming notes, create story documentation, analyze your writing, and more.\n\n## What This Plugin Does\n\nThis plugin is a comprehensive creative writing assistant that helps you throughout your entire writing process. Whether you're brainstorming ideas, writing prose, or refining your work, it adapts to your needs and learns your personal style.\n\n### Capabilities\n\n- **Brainstorm and capture story ideas** - Explore plot options, worldbuilding, character arcs, and story structure without over-committing to decisions\n- **Write prose in your personal style** - Generate scenes, chapters, and dialogue that match your unique voice and writing patterns\n- **Create style guides from your writing** - Analyze your existing work to capture your voice, dialogue patterns, formatting preferences, and more\n- **Get feedback and critique** - Receive constructive analysis of pacing, character consistency, dialogue quality, and prose\n- **Build comprehensive story documentation** - Create character profiles, location wikis, lore pages, and reference materials for your fictional world\n- **Maintain consistency across your project** - Automatically reference your established characters, settings, and story rules\n\n### How to Use (After Installation)\n\nOnce you've installed the skills (see installation sections below for Claude.ai or Claude Code), mention **\"creative writing\"** in your requests, and the appropriate skills should activate based on your needs. If it doesn't work, you can try to mention **\"cw-router\"** directly, and if that doesn't work, make sure to mention to **\"use a skill\"**.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Help me brainstorm ideas for my magic system\" (creative writing)\n- \"Write the next scene where my protagonist discovers the truth\" (use a skill)\n- \"Create a style guide based on these three chapters\" (cw-router)\n- \"Critique this chapter for pacing and character consistency\" (creative writing)\n\n---\n\n## For Claude.ai Users\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- A paid Claude plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise) - Skills are not available on the free tier\n- Code execution enabled in Settings → Capabilities (usually enabled by default)\n\n### Installation\n\n1. **Download skills from releases:**\n   - Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/haowjy/creative-writing-skills/releases)\n   - Download the `.skill` files you want to use:\n     - `cw-router.skill`\n     - `cw-prose-writing.skill`\n     - `cw-story-critique.skill`\n     - `cw-style-skill-creator.skill`\n     - `cw-brainstorming.skill`\n     - `cw-official-docs.skill`\n\n2. **Upload to Claude.ai:**\n   - Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)\n   - Click your profile icon → **Settings**\n   - Navigate to **Capabilities** → **Skills**\n   - Click **\"Upload skill\"**\n   - Upload each `.skill` file (you can drag and drop or click to browse)\n\n**Tips:**\n- Upload only the skills you plan to use\n- Start with cw-router, cw-prose-writing, and cw-brainstorming for a core set\n- You can add more skills later as needed\n\n### Usage\n\nAfter uploading skills, simply mention them in your conversations or let Claude automatically use them when appropriate.\n\n**Basic usage examples:**\n- \"Use cw-brainstorming to help me explore ideas for my antagonist\"\n- \"Use cw-prose-writing to write this scene in my style\"\n- \"Use cw-story-critique to analyze this chapter\"\n\n### Setting Up a Writing Project (Recommended)\n\nFor the best experience, create a dedicated Project for your writing:\n\n1. **Create a new Project:**\n   - Go to Projects (left sidebar) → Create new project\n   - Name it after your writing project (e.g., \"My Fantasy Novel\")\n\n2. **Configure the Project to use skills:**\n   - In Project Settings → Custom instructions, add:\n     ```\n     This is a creative writing project. You have access to the following skills:\n     - cw-router: Guide me to the right skill\n     - cw-prose-writing: Write prose in my style\n     - cw-brainstorming: Capture brainstorming notes\n     - cw-story-critique: Provide writing feedback\n     - cw-style-skill-creator: Create style guides\n     - cw-official-docs: Create story documentation\n\n     Use these skills as appropriate for creative writing tasks.\n     ```\n\n     along with any other project-specific instructions (like a bit about what the story is about)\n\n3. **Build your Project knowledge base:**\n   - Use the skills in your chat to create documents (style guides, character profiles, worldbuilding pages)\n   - Download/copy the documents Claude creates\n   - Edit them if needed\n   - Re-upload them to your Project knowledge base\n   - Repeat this process as your story develops\n\n**Pro tip:** With a configured Project, Claude will automatically use the appropriate skill based on your request, and all responses will be informed by your growing knowledge base. Each document you create and upload makes future responses more accurate and consistent!\n\n**Important note about file formats:**\n- Use **plain text formats** (.txt, .md) for your documents - these work best with AI\n- If using a text editor, consider: VS Code, Cursor, Notepad, Notepad++, or any plain text editor\n- **Avoid Microsoft Word (.docx)** - binary formats are harder for AI to read and format correctly\n\n**Want an even better experience?** Consider using **Claude Code** (see below) with a text editor like VS Code or Cursor. This lets you work directly with files on your computer, making it much easier to organize and maintain your writing project.\n\n---\n\n## For Claude Code Users\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n**What is Node.js?**\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript programs on your computer (not just in web browsers). It comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which is used to install tools like Claude Code.\n\n**What is Claude Code?**\nClaude Code is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that lets you use Claude directly in your terminal and code editor. It's designed for developers and writers who work with files and projects.\n\n---\n\n#### For Windows Users (Recommended: WSL2)\n\n**Why WSL2?**\nClaude Code works best in a Unix-like environment with Unix commands. WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) gives you a full Linux environment on Windows, providing the best experience.\n\n**Install WSL2:**\n1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click Start menu → \"Windows PowerShell (Admin)\")\n2. Run: `wsl --install`\n3. Restart your computer when prompted\n4. After restart, Ubuntu will open and ask you to create a username and password\n5. Install Node.js in WSL2:\n   ```bash\n   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -\n   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n   ```\n6. Verify: `node --version` and `npm --version`\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting, see [Microsoft's WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n\n**Install Claude Code:**\nFollow the quickstart guide at [Claude Code Quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart).\n\n**Using WSL2:**\n- Open Ubuntu from your Start menu to access the Linux terminal\n- Your Windows files are accessible at `/mnt/c/` (C: drive), `/mnt/d/` (D: drive), etc.\n- Navigate to your writing project: `cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Documents/my-novel`\n\n**Advanced: Native Windows (PowerShell)**\nYou can also install Node.js and Claude Code directly on Windows, but some Unix-specific features may not work as expected. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download) and follow the Windows installer.\n\n---\n\n#### For Mac/Linux Users\n\n**Install Node.js:**\n1. Visit [nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download)\n2. Download the installer for your operating system\n3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard (this installs both Node.js and npm)\n4. Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`\n\n**Install Claude Code:**\nFollow the quickstart guide at [Claude Code Quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart).\n\n**Using Terminal:**\n- **Mac:** Open Terminal from Applications → Utilities or search \"Terminal\"\n- **Linux:** Open Terminal from your applications menu or press Ctrl+Alt+T\n- Navigate folders: `cd foldername` to enter, `cd ..` to go back\n- See current location: `pwd`\n- List files: `ls`\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)\n\n1. Add this marketplace to Claude Code:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin marketplace add haowjy/creative-writing-skills\n   ```\n\n2. Install the plugin:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin install creative-writing-skills@creative-writing-skills\n   ```\n\n3. Verify installation:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin\n   ```\n\nYou should see `creative-writing-skills` listed with all six skills.\n\n#### Option 2: Install from Local Path\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/haowjy/creative-writing-skills.git\n   ```\n\n2. Add as a local marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin marketplace add ./creative-writing-skills\n   ```\n\n3. Install the plugin:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin install creative-writing-skills\n   ```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, simply ask Claude for help with creative writing tasks. The router skill will help guide you to the right tool, or Claude will automatically select the appropriate skill based on your request.\n\n**Natural language examples:**\n- \"Help me brainstorm ideas for my magic system\"\n- \"Write the next scene where my protagonist confronts the antagonist\"\n- \"Create a character profile for my protagonist\"\n- \"Analyze the pacing of this chapter and give me feedback\"\n- \"Create a style guide based on my existing chapters\"\n\n**Slash commands (explicit mode switching):**\n\nThis plugin includes custom slash commands for explicit skill invocation:\n- `/bs` - Brainstorm and explore story ideas\n- `/write [style]` - Enter prose writing mode (optionally specify a style)\n- `/wiki` - Create canonical wiki/documentation pages\n- `/critique` - Get feedback on your writing\n\nThese commands are included in the plugin and work automatically after installation.\n\n### Setting Up a Writing Project\n\nFor best results, create a dedicated directory for your writing project:\n\n1. **Create a project directory:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my-novel\n   cd my-novel\n   ```\n\n2. **Generate a style guide:**\n   - Place sample chapters in your project directory\n   - Ask: \"Analyze my writing style and create a style guide\"\n   - Save the generated style guide (e.g., `style-guide.md`)\n\n3. **Organize your project:**\n   ```\n   my-novel/\n   ├── .claude/\n   │   └── CLAUDE.md           # Project instructions\n   ├── style-guide.md          # Your writing style\n   ├── characters/             # Character profiles\n   ├── world-building/         # Lore and setting\n   └── chapters/               # Your manuscript\n   ```\n\n4. **Work with context:**\n   When you work in this directory, Claude automatically uses your style guides, character profiles, and world-building notes to maintain consistency.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n### Complete Writing Workflow\n\n1. **Brainstorm your story:**\n   ```\n   \"Help me brainstorm a magic system for my fantasy world\"\n   (Uses cw-brainstorming)\n   ```\n\n2. **Document finalized ideas:**\n   ```\n   \"Create a documentation page for my magic system\"\n   (Uses cw-official-docs)\n   ```\n\n3. **Analyze your writing style:**\n   ```\n   \"Analyze these three chapters and create a style guide\"\n   (Uses cw-style-skill-creator)\n   ```\n\n4. **Write new content:**\n   ```\n   \"Write the opening scene of chapter 5\"\n   (Uses cw-prose-writing with your style guide)\n   ```\n\n5. **Get feedback:**\n   ```\n   \"Critique this chapter for pacing and character consistency\"\n   (Uses cw-story-critique)\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Use when the user is exploring narrative ideas, discussing characters, planning episodes, or thinking through story possibilities. Creates minimal working notes that preserve creative freedom by recording only what was stated and marking sources.\n---\n\n# Brainstorming Capture\n\nCapture story brainstorming in working note format that preserves creative freedom.\n\n## Core Principle\n\nRecord brainstorming WITHOUT:\n- Over-elaborating on what was stated\n- Mixing user statements with AI suggestions unmarked\n- Inventing excessive details\n- Constraining future creativity\n\n**AI suggestions are valuable but must be clearly marked and kept minimal.**\n\n## Types of Brainstorming\n\nThis skill handles all brainstorming types:\n- Story/plot directions (general narrative exploration)\n- Chapter structure and beats (planning individual chapters)\n- Worldbuilding and lore (magic systems, cultures, history, geography)\n- Character development (motivations, arcs, relationships)\n- Timeline and continuity (chronology, contradictions)\n\nAll share core principles (minimal capture, source tagging, preserve vagueness).\nSee references/ for specialized guidance:\n- `chapter-planning.md` - Capturing beat and scene exploration\n- `worldbuilding.md` - Exploring fictional world elements (use web search for research)\n- `character-development.md` - Exploring motivations, arcs, relationships\n- `continuity-timeline.md` - Timeline tracking and contradiction handling\n\n## Critical Rules\n\n### 1. Minimal Capture Only\n\nRecord ONLY what the user explicitly states. Do NOT add elaborations, examples they didn't give, or details to fill gaps.\n\n**The problem is mixing, not suggesting:**\n\n❌ User: \"Character A competes with B\" → Capture: \"A and B compete for leadership through a tournament with three rounds...\"\n✅ User: \"Character A competes with B\" → Capture: \"A and B compete\" + optional: \"<AI>Tournament? Political? Trial?</AI>\"\n\n### 2. Source Tagging (Simple 3-Tag System)\n\n**Default: Untagged = user said it.** Most ideas come from the user, so treat them as the default.\n\n**ONLY use tags for special context:**\n\n1. **`<AI>...</AI>`** - AI suggestions/possibilities (MUST be clearly wrapped)\n   - Use when offering ideas user didn't state\n   - Keep to 2-3 brief options\n   - Example: `<AI>Competition could be: tournament-style, political maneuvering, or trial-based</AI>`\n\n2. **`<hidden>...</hidden>`** - Author-only information meant to be revealed later\n   - Secret character motivations\n   - Planned twists/revelations\n   - Behind-the-scenes reasons unknown to characters/readers yet\n   - Example: `<hidden>Z secretly wants them both to fail so he can reclaim leadership</hidden>`\n\n**When to offer AI suggestions:**\n- User asks for ideas\n- User seems stuck\n- Offering brief possibilities to spark creativity\n\n**When to stay minimal:**\n- User is actively exploring their own ideas\n- Just capturing an ongoing discussion\n- User didn't ask for suggestions\n\n### 3. Preserve Vagueness\n\nKeep it vague if user leaves it vague:\n- \"might create tension\" → Record as uncertain\n- \"thinking about\" → Record as consideration\n- \"maybe\" → Record as possibility\n\n### 4. Multiple Options Coexist\n\nWorking notes can contain contradictions and multiple possibilities. Don't resolve them - just list the options being considered.\n\n## Output Approach\n\n**Use whatever structure fits the discussion.** Could be:\n- Bullet lists\n- Sections organized by topic\n- Timeline format\n- Character-focused groupings\n- Whatever captures the brainstorm clearly\n\n**Essential elements:**\n- Minimal capture (user's words, not elaborations)\n- Vagueness preserved\n- AI suggestions wrapped in `<AI>` tags\n- Author-only info wrapped in `<hidden>` tags when relevant\n\n**Optional sections based on discussion:**\n- Open questions to explore\n- Multiple options being considered\n- AI suggestions (if offered)\n- Contradictions to resolve later\n\n## Teaching Example: The Distinction\n\n### User Says:\n\"I'm thinking character X and character Y compete for leadership. Maybe this creates tension with character Z who was the previous leader.\"\n\n### ✅ Good Capture:\n```markdown\n# Leadership Competition Notes\n\n- X and Y compete for leadership\n- Z was previous leader\n- May create tension with Z (uncertain)\n\nOpen questions:\n- Form of competition?\n- How does Z respond?\n- Outcome?\n```\n\n### ❌ Bad Capture:\n```markdown\n# Leadership Competition Arc\n\nX and Y compete for leadership after Z steps down. Z feels threatened by the challenge to his authority.\n\nThe competition unfolds in three stages:\n1. Announcement and initial positioning\n2. First challenge where X demonstrates strength\n3. Second challenge where Y shows wisdom\n...\n[20 more invented beats]\n```\n\n**Why bad?** Added massive elaboration the user never stated.\n\n### ✅ Good with AI Suggestions:\n```markdown\n# Leadership Competition Notes\n\n- X and Y compete for leadership\n- Z was previous leader\n- May create tension with Z (uncertain)\n\nOpen questions:\n- Competition format: <AI>tournament-style? political maneuvering? trial-based?</AI>\n- Z's response: <AI>oppose both? support one? stay neutral?</AI>\n- Resolution?\n```\n\n### ✅ Good with Hidden Author Notes:\n```markdown\n# Leadership Competition Notes\n\n- X and Y compete for leadership\n- Z was previous leader\n- May create tension with Z (uncertain)\n- <hidden>Z is secretly manipulating both X and Y to destroy each other, planning to reclaim power after they're both discredited</hidden>\n\nOpen questions:\n- Competition format?\n- Outcome?\n```\n\n**Why use `<hidden>`?** The manipulation twist is planned for later reveal. Readers/characters don't know yet, but the author needs to track it while brainstorming.\n\n## If You're Over-Elaborating\n\n**Stop if you're writing:**\n- Numbered scene lists\n- Detailed backstories\n- Specific dialogue\n- Precise timelines\n- Multiple paragraphs per point\n- Examples user didn't mention\n\nWrap AI suggestions in `<AI>` tags, keep minimal (2-3 options).\n\n## Success Check\n\n**Good:** User says \"Yes, that's what I said\"\n**Bad:** User says \"I never said all that\"\n\nNotes should feel skeletal and incomplete. That's the point - preserves creative freedom.\n\n## After Capturing: Discuss and Explore\n\n**DON'T just write notes and stop.** After capturing, engage with the user to help develop ideas:\n\n**Useful follow-ups:**\n- **Clarifying questions:** \"You mentioned tension with Z - are you thinking internal conflict or external confrontation?\"\n- **Potential directions:** \"This setup could go a few ways: political intrigue, personal drama, or action-focused. What feels right?\"\n- **Exploring implications:** \"If Z opposes them both, how does that change the power dynamics?\"\n- **Connecting threads:** \"This competition ties into the earlier succession crisis you mentioned - want to explore that link?\"\n\n**Keep it conversational:**\n- Offer 2-3 possibilities, not exhaustive lists\n- Ask about what excites the user\n- Help clarify vague ideas without over-defining them\n- Point out interesting implications or contradictions\n\n**The goal:** Help the user think through their ideas, not take over the creative process.\n\n## Skills are Composable\n\nFeel free to combine with other skills when helpful (e.g., using cw-official-docs to document finalized worldbuilding, or cw-story-critique to analyze what you're brainstorming).\n\n## File Placement (Claude Code)\n\n1. Check project docs for conventions\n2. Look at where similar content lives\n3. Place near related content\n4. Name: `brainstorm-[topic].md`\n5. Ask if unclear\n",
        "creative-writing-skills/cw-official-docs/SKILL.md": "---\nname: cw-official-docs\ndescription: Creative writing skill for creating canonical reference documentation (wikis) for fictional worlds, characters, and story events. Use when creating or updating wiki pages, official documentation, character profiles, location documentation, or lore pages. Creates polished, sourced, encyclopedic reference material.\n---\n\n# Official Documentation\n\nCreate canonical, sourced wiki pages for your story's characters, locations, events, and lore.\n\n## Purpose\n\nBuild authoritative documentation (wiki-style pages) that serves as \"single source of truth\" for your fictional world. These are polished, cited, encyclopedic reference pages suitable for readers - NOT working notes or brainstorming.\n\n**Can be created before or during writing** for worldbuilding, lore, and reference material that won't all appear in the story itself.\n\n## Documentation vs Brainstorm Notes\n\n**The key distinction:** Documentation = you've decided and it's polished enough to show someone. Brainstorm = you're still figuring it out.\n\n| Documentation | Brainstorm |\n|------|------------|\n| Single version | Multiple options coexist |\n| Polished | Skeletal |\n| No [TBD] markers | Source tags throughout |\n| Reader-ready | Author's working notes |\n| Finalized decisions | Exploratory |\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Canonical Only\n\nWiki pages contain ONLY confirmed information:\n- Facts from written chapters OR finalized worldbuilding\n- Details the author has decided\n- Single authoritative version\n\n### 2. Citations Required\n\nEvery claim needs a source:\n- Chapter references for story facts\n- \"Worldbuilding document: [filename]\" for lore created before writing\n- Scene-specific citations when possible\n\n### 3. Encyclopedic Tone\n\nWrite like a reference work:\n- Third person\n- Past tense for completed events, present for current state\n- Neutral, factual tone\n\n## Flexible Structure\n\n**Documentation pages aren't templates to fill in** - structure should fit the content.\n\nSome character pages need detailed backstory, others don't. Some locations are just \"a tavern in the capital\" - that's one paragraph, not 12 sections. Some magic systems need elaborate rules, others are intentionally mysterious.\n\n**Include what matters, skip what doesn't.** Trust your judgment.\n\nSee references/page-patterns.md for common patterns and examples - not mandatory structures.\n\n## Creating Documentation Pages\n\n1. **Decide what needs documenting** - Character? Location? System? Event?\n2. **Choose relevant structure** - See references/page-patterns.md for common patterns\n3. **Write what matters** - Skip irrelevant sections, adapt structure to content\n4. **Add citations** - See references/citation-guide.md for formats\n5. **Cross-reference** - Link related pages for discoverability\n\nStructure adapts to content - not every page needs every section.\n\n## Using Web Search\n\nSearch when helpful for:\n- Verifying real-world facts your story references\n- Research for worldbuilding elements\n- Finding similar fictional documentation/wikis for inspiration\n- Checking naming conventions or terminology\n\n## Timing\n\n**You can write documentation pages BEFORE writing story chapters** - just ensure content is finalized and presentation-ready, not exploratory.\n\n**For worldbuilding/lore:** Finalize concept → Create documentation page → Use while writing\n\n**For story events:** Write chapters → Document what happened → Create documentation page\n\n## Teaching Example: Simple vs Complex\n\n**Not every page needs elaborate structure:**\n\n**Simple location (totally valid):**\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: The Broken Wheel Tavern\ntype: location\n---\n\n# The Broken Wheel Tavern\n\nA run-down tavern in the merchant quarter of Kingsport. Known for cheap ale and cheaper rooms.\n\nThe protagonist meets their contact here in Chapter 3.\n\n**References:**\n- Chapter 3: First meeting scene\n```\n\n**Complex character (when needed):**\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Marcus Webb\ntype: character\nstatus: alive\n---\n\n# Marcus Webb\n\nFormer military intelligence officer turned information broker in Kingsport.\n\n## Background\nServed 15 years in the Royal Intelligence Service before a scandal forced his resignation. Now operates independently, selling information to whoever can pay.\n\n## Appearance\nMid-40s, graying hair, military bearing despite civilian clothes. Distinctive scar across left eyebrow from field injury.\n\n## Role in Story\nActs as information source for the protagonist. Provides critical intelligence about the conspiracy in Chapter 3, then becomes recurring ally throughout Arc 1.\n\n## Key Relationships\n- **Sarah Chen**: Former colleague, maintains uneasy trust\n- **The protagonist**: Professional relationship, provides information for payment\n\n**References:**\n- Chapter 3: First introduction, provides intel\n- Chapter 7: Warns protagonist about surveillance  \n- Chapter 12: Reveals his own involvement in the conspiracy\n```\n\n**Both are valid** - structure fits what needs documenting.\n\n## Skills are Composable\n\nFeel free to combine with other skills when helpful (e.g., using cw-brainstorming while exploring worldbuilding before finalizing into documentation pages).\n\n## File Placement (Claude Code)\n\n1. Check project documentation for organization\n2. Common locations: `docs/`, `wiki/`, `docs/reference/`, `reference/`\n3. Match existing naming conventions\n4. Ask if unclear\n\n## Resources\n\nSee:\n- `references/page-patterns.md` - Common patterns and examples (not templates)\n- `references/citation-guide.md` - How to cite sources\n- `references/example-pages.md` - Complete example pages at different complexity levels\n",

Understand Context First\n\nAlways ask about audience and goals before critiquing:\n\n```\nBefore I critique this, help me understand:\n\n1. Target audience? (YA, adult, genre, platform)\n2.

Use Web Search When Helpful\n\nSearch when you'd benefit from:\n- Genre convention verification\n- Narrative technique terminology\n- How similar stories handled challenges\n- Fact checking\n- Craft advice on specific techniques\n\n### 5. Calibrate to Context\n\n- Early draft → big picture issues\n- Later draft → line-level details OK\n- Genre matters (thriller vs literary, fanfic vs traditional)\n- Platform matters (web serial needs hooks, traditional needs opening, fanfic needs canon adherence)\n\n## Output Modes\n\n**Balanced** (default): Strengths + areas for improvement + priorities\n\n**Harsh** (if requested): Focus on problems, minimize or skip strengths section\n\n**Flexible**: Whatever structure serves this story best\n\n## Skills are Composable\n\nFeel free to combine with other skills when helpful - e.g., using cw-official-docs to check canon accuracy during critique.\n",
