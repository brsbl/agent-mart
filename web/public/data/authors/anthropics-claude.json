        "plugins/pr-review-toolkit/README.md": "# PR Review Toolkit\n\nA comprehensive collection of specialized agents for thorough pull request review, covering code comments, test coverage, error handling, type design, code quality, and code simplification.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin bundles 6 expert review agents that each focus on a specific aspect of code quality. Use them individually for targeted reviews or together for comprehensive PR analysis.\n\n## Agents\n\n### 1. comment-analyzer\n**Focus**: Code comment accuracy and maintainability\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- Comment accuracy vs actual code\n- Documentation completeness\n- Comment rot and technical debt\n- Misleading or outdated comments\n\n**When to use:**\n- After adding documentation\n- Before finalizing PRs with comment changes\n- When reviewing existing comments\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Check if the comments are accurate\"\n\"Review the documentation I added\"\n\"Analyze comments for technical debt\"\n```\n\n### 2. pr-test-analyzer\n**Focus**: Test coverage quality and completeness\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- Behavioral vs line coverage\n- Critical gaps in test coverage\n- Test quality and resilience\n- Edge cases and error conditions\n\n**When to use:**\n- After creating a PR\n- When adding new functionality\n- To verify test thoroughness\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Check if the tests are thorough\"\n\"Review test coverage for this PR\"\n\"Are there any critical test gaps?\"\n```\n\n### 3. silent-failure-hunter\n**Focus**: Error handling and silent failures\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- Silent failures in catch blocks\n- Inadequate error handling\n- Inappropriate fallback behavior\n- Missing error logging\n\n**When to use:**\n- After implementing error handling\n- When reviewing try/catch blocks\n- Before finalizing PRs with error handling\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Review the error handling\"\n\"Check for silent failures\"\n\"Analyze catch blocks in this PR\"\n```\n\n### 4. type-design-analyzer\n**Focus**: Type design quality and invariants\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- Type encapsulation (rated 1-10)\n- Invariant expression (rated 1-10)\n- Type usefulness (rated 1-10)\n- Invariant enforcement (rated 1-10)\n\n**When to use:**\n- When introducing new types\n- During PR creation with data models\n- When refactoring type designs\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Review the UserAccount type design\"\n\"Analyze type design in this PR\"\n\"Check if this type has strong invariants\"\n```\n\n### 5. code-reviewer\n**Focus**: General code review for project guidelines\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- CLAUDE.md compliance\n- Style violations\n- Bug detection\n- Code quality issues\n\n**When to use:**\n- After writing or modifying code\n- Before committing changes\n- Before creating pull requests\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Review my recent changes\"\n\"Check if everything looks good\"\n\"Review this code before I commit\"\n```\n\n### 6. code-simplifier\n**Focus**: Code simplification and refactoring\n\n**Analyzes:**\n- Code clarity and readability\n- Unnecessary complexity and nesting\n- Redundant code and abstractions\n- Consistency with project standards\n- Overly compact or clever code\n\n**When to use:**\n- After writing or modifying code\n- After passing code review\n- When code works but feels complex\n\n**Triggers:**\n```\n\"Simplify this code\"\n\"Make this clearer\"\n\"Refine this implementation\"\n```\n\n**Note**: This agent preserves functionality while improving code structure and maintainability.\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\n### Individual Agent Usage\n\nSimply ask questions that match an agent's focus area, and Claude will automatically trigger the appropriate agent:\n\n```\n\"Can you check if the tests cover all edge cases?\"\n→ Triggers pr-test-analyzer\n\n\"Review the error handling in the API client\"\n→ Triggers silent-failure-hunter\n\n\"I've added documentation - is it accurate?\"\n→ Triggers comment-analyzer\n```\n\n### Comprehensive PR Review\n\nFor thorough PR review, ask for multiple aspects:\n\n```\n\"I'm ready to create this PR. Please:\n1. Review test coverage\n2. Check for silent failures\n3. Verify code comments are accurate\n4. Review any new types\n5. General code review\"\n```\n\nThis will trigger all relevant agents to analyze different aspects of your PR.\n\n### Proactive Review\n\nClaude may proactively use these agents based on context:\n\n- **After writing code** → code-reviewer\n- **After adding docs** → comment-analyzer\n- **Before creating PR** → Multiple agents as appropriate\n- **After adding types** → type-design-analyzer\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from your personal marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugins\n# Find \"pr-review-toolkit\"\n# Install\n```\n\nOr add manually to settings if needed.\n\n## Agent Details\n\n### Confidence Scoring\n\nAgents provide confidence scores for their findings:\n\n**comment-analyzer**: Identifies issues with high confidence in accuracy checks\n\n**pr-test-analyzer**: Rates test gaps 1-10 (10 = critical, must add)\n\n**silent-failure-hunter**: Flags severity of error handling issues\n\n**type-design-analyzer**: Rates 4 dimensions on 1-10 scale\n\n**code-reviewer**: Scores issues 0-100 (91-100 = critical)\n\n**code-simplifier**: Identifies complexity and suggests simplifications\n\n### Output Formats\n\nAll agents provide structured, actionable output:\n- Clear issue identification\n- Specific file and line references\n- Explanation of why it's a problem\n- Suggestions for improvement\n- Prioritized by severity\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When to Use Each Agent\n\n**Before Committing:**\n- code-reviewer (general quality)\n- silent-failure-hunter (if changed error handling)\n\n**Before Creating PR:**\n- pr-test-analyzer (test coverage check)\n- comment-analyzer (if added/modified comments)\n- type-design-analyzer (if added/modified types)\n- code-reviewer (final sweep)\n\n**After Passing Review:**\n- code-simplifier (improve clarity and maintainability)\n\n**During PR Review:**\n- Any agent for specific concerns raised\n- Targeted re-review after fixes\n\n### Running Multiple Agents\n\nYou can request multiple agents to run in parallel or sequentially:\n\n**Parallel** (faster):\n```\n\"Run pr-test-analyzer and comment-analyzer in parallel\"\n```\n\n**Sequential** (when one informs the other):\n```\n\"First review test coverage, then check code quality\"\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Be specific**: Target specific agents for focused review\n- **Use proactively**: Run before creating PRs, not after\n- **Address critical issues first**: Agents prioritize findings\n- **Iterate**: Run again after fixes to verify\n- **Don't over-use**: Focus on changed code, not entire codebase\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Agent Not Triggering\n\n**Issue**: Asked for review but agent didn't run\n\n**Solution**:\n- Be more specific in your request\n- Mention the agent type explicitly\n- Reference the specific concern (e.g., \"test coverage\")\n\n### Agent Analyzing Wrong Files\n\n**Issue**: Agent reviewing too much or wrong files\n\n**Solution**:\n- Specify which files to focus on\n- Reference the PR number or branch\n- Mention \"recent changes\" or \"git diff\"\n\n## Integration with Workflow\n\nThis plugin works great with:\n- **build-validator**: Run build/tests before review\n- **Project-specific agents**: Combine with your custom agents\n\n**Recommended workflow:**\n1. Write code → **code-reviewer**\n2. Fix issues → **silent-failure-hunter** (if error handling)\n3. Add tests → **pr-test-analyzer**\n4. Document → **comment-analyzer**\n5. Review passes → **code-simplifier** (polish)\n6. Create PR\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound issues or have suggestions? These agents are maintained in:\n- User agents: `~/.claude/agents/`\n- Project agents: `.claude/agents/` in claude-cli-internal\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\nDaisy (daisy@anthropic.com)\n\n---\n\n**Quick Start**: Just ask for review and the right agent will trigger automatically!\n"
