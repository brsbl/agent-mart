        "README.md": "# Skills Marketplace: Public\n\nA free, curated collection of skills for Claude Code and other AI coding assistants.\n\n## What Are Skills?\n\nSkills are instructions that teach AI assistants how to perform specific tasks. When you install a skill, your AI assistant gains new capabilities - like knowing how to deploy to your server, follow your team's coding standards, or use your project's specific tools.\n\nThink of skills like browser extensions, but for AI assistants. They extend what your AI can do.\n\n### Write Once, Use Everywhere\n\nSkills follow the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), an open standard supported by multiple AI coding assistants including Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot. This means:\n\n- **One skill works across all platforms** - Write a skill once and use it with any supported AI assistant\n- **No vendor lock-in** - Your skills aren't tied to a single tool\n- **Portable workflows** - Switch between AI assistants without losing your custom capabilities\n- **Automatic syncing** - Use the `skill-manager` skill to automatically distribute skills across all your AI tools with a single command\n\n## Quick Start (5 minutes)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) installed (the CLI or VS Code extension)\n- A terminal or VS Code\n\n### Step 1: Add This Marketplace\n\nOpen Claude Code and run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add jmichaelschmidt/skills-public\n```\n\nThis tells Claude Code where to find skills. You only need to do this once.\n\n### Step 2: Browse and Install Skills\n\nRun:\n\n```\n/plugin\n```\n\nThis opens the plugin browser. Use the arrow keys to navigate:\n- Go to the **Discover** tab to see available skills\n- Select a skill and press Enter to see details\n- Choose \"Install for you (user scope)\" to install it for all your projects\n\n### Step 3: Use Your New Skills\n\nOnce installed, the skill is automatically active. Just ask Claude to do something the skill enables, or ask it to explain the skill to you.\n\n**Example - ask about a skill:**\n> \"How does the skill-manager skill work?\"\n\nYour AI assistant will read the skill's instructions and explain its capabilities, commands, and how to use it.\n\n**Example - use a skill:**\n> \"List all my installed skills\"\n\nor\n\n> \"Sync my skills to Codex\"\n\nClaude will automatically use the skill's instructions to complete the task.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [prd-planner](skills/prd-planner/) | Generate structured PRD planning documents optimized for AI-assisted development. Creates discrete, single-conversation tasks with reasoning level estimates to optimize token usage and model selection. |\n| [skill-manager](skills/skill-manager/) | Manage, sync, and publish Agent Skills across multiple AI platforms. Write a skill once in Claude Code, then distribute it to Codex, Gemini CLI, and Copilot simultaneously. |\n\n## Trust & Security\n\n### Curated by Collaborators\n\nThis is a **curated marketplace**, not an open publishing platform. Skills are added by known collaborators and reviewed before being merged. We don't accept unsolicited skill submissions from the general public.\n\nThis approach ensures:\n\n- **No malicious instructions** - We review for prompt injection, data exfiltration attempts, and other security risks\n- **No harmful commands** - Skills that run destructive commands must include appropriate warnings and confirmations\n- **Transparent behavior** - Skills do what they claim to do, nothing more\n- **Quality standards** - Skills are well-documented and actually useful\n\n### How We Review Skills\n\nEvery skill is reviewed before being added. We check for:\n\n1. **Security risks** - Prompt injection, attempts to override safety guidelines, hidden instructions\n2. **Data safety** - No sending user data to external services without clear disclosure\n3. **Destructive operations** - Any commands that delete, overwrite, or modify system files must have safeguards\n4. **Credential handling** - Skills must not log, transmit, or mishandle sensitive information\n5. **Accuracy** - The skill description must match what it actually does\n\n### Your Responsibility\n\nEven with our review process, you should:\n\n- **Read a skill before installing** - Check the SKILL.md to understand what it does\n- **Review any scripts** - If a skill includes scripts, inspect them before running\n- **Report concerns** - If you notice suspicious behavior, [open an issue](https://github.com/jmichaelschmidt/skills-public/issues)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### For Collaborators\n\nIf you're a collaborator on this repository, you can add skills directly or via pull request. Please follow the skill structure and guidelines below.\n\n### Interested in Contributing?\n\nIf you've built a skill you think would be valuable here, [open an issue](https://github.com/jmichaelschmidt/skills-public/issues) to start a conversation. We may invite you as a collaborator if it's a good fit.\n\n### Skill Structure\n\n```\nskills/\n└── your-skill-name/\n    ├── SKILL.md        # Required - the skill instructions\n    ├── scripts/        # Optional - helper scripts\n    └── references/     # Optional - reference docs\n```\n\n### SKILL.md Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: A short description of what this skill does and when to use it.\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\nInstructions for the AI assistant go here...\n```\n\n### Skill Guidelines\n\nGood skills are:\n\n- **Focused** - Do one thing well\n- **Clear** - Write instructions the AI can follow unambiguously\n- **Safe** - Include warnings for destructive operations; never hide behavior\n- **Documented** - Explain what the skill does, when to use it, and any prerequisites\n- **Cross-platform** - Avoid hardcoding paths or platform-specific assumptions when possible\n\n## Installing Skills Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use the `/plugin` UI, you can install skills manually:\n\n1. Clone this repo or download a skill folder\n2. Copy it to `~/.claude/skills/`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\nFor other platforms:\n- **Codex**: `~/.codex/skills/`\n- **Gemini CLI**: `~/.gemini/skills/`\n- **GitHub Copilot**: `~/.copilot/skills/`\n\nOr use the `skill-manager` skill to sync across all platforms automatically.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Marketplace not found\" error\n\nMake sure you added the marketplace first:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add jmichaelschmidt/skills-public\n```\n\n### Skill not appearing after install\n\n1. Try reloading your IDE window (VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` → \"Reload Window\")\n2. In `/plugin`, go to Marketplaces tab and press `u` to update\n\n### \"Authentication failed\" for private repos\n\nThis marketplace is public, so no authentication is needed. If you're trying to add a private marketplace, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment.\n\n## Learn More\n\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) - Technical spec for skill authors\n\n## License\n\nSkills in this marketplace are provided as-is.

        "skills/prd-planner/SKILL.md": "---\nname: prd-planner\ndescription: Generate structured PRD (Product Requirements Document) planning documents optimized for AI-assisted development. Creates discrete, single-conversation tasks with reasoning level estimates to optimize token usage and model selection. Use when users want to plan implementation work, break down features into tasks, create implementation roadmaps, or structure development work for AI pair programming. Triggers on phrases like \"create a PRD\", \"plan this feature\", \"break down this task\", \"implementation plan\", \"create threads for\", or \"help me plan\".\n---\n\n# PRD Planner\n\nGenerate structured planning documents that optimize AI-assisted development by breaking work into discrete, context-efficient conversation threads.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Thread Isolation** - Each task is scoped for a single conversation to minimize context carryover\n2. **Reasoning Economy** - Match model capability to task complexity (don't waste high reasoning on low tasks)\n3. **Self-Contained Context** - Every thread has all information needed to execute without external reference\n4. **Progressive Tracking** - Checklist format enables clear progress visibility and serves as context for subsequent threads\n\n## PRD Creation Process\n\n1. **Understand the scope** - Gather requirements, constraints, and success criteria\n2. **Analyze complexity** - Identify discrete work units and their dependencies\n3. **Assign reasoning levels** - Estimate cognitive load per task\n4. **Generate the PRD** - Use the template structure from [references/prd-template.md](references/prd-template.md)\n5. **Validate completeness** - Ensure each thread is self-contained\n\n## Reasoning Level Guidelines\n\nAssign reasoning levels based on task characteristics. See [references/reasoning-levels.md](references/reasoning-levels.md) for detailed guidance.\n\n| Level | Characteristics | Model Recommendation |\n|-------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| **Minimal** | Procedural, well-documented, single-file | Haiku |\n| **Low** | Clear patterns, limited decisions, 2-3 files | Haiku or Sonnet |\n| **Medium** | Code comprehension, refactoring, integration | Sonnet |\n| **Medium-High** | Architecture decisions, test orchestration | Sonnet or Opus |\n| **High** | Novel problems, system design, complex debugging | Opus |\n\n## Thread Structure Requirements\n\nEvery thread in the PRD MUST include:\n\n1. **Thread identifier** - Numbered for tracking (e.g., \"Thread 3\" or \"Step 15\")\n2. **Purpose statement** - Clear goal in one sentence\n3. **Actions/Changes** - Specific work to perform\n4. **Reference material** - File paths to read first (use `file.py:1` format for line hints)\n5. **Validation targets** - How to verify completion\n6. **Deliverables** - Expected outputs\n7. **Reasoning effort** - Level with model recommendation\n\n### Optional Thread Fields (include when applicable)\n\n- **Key decisions** - Choices with options and recommendations\n- **Acceptance criteria** - Testable success metrics\n- **Dependencies** - Prerequisite threads\n- **Migration notes** - Backward compatibility, rollback plans\n\n## PRD Document Structure\n\nUse this structure for all PRDs. See [references/prd-template.md](references/prd-template.md) for full template.\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Project Name] Plan\n\n## Objective\n[1-2 sentence goal]\n\n## Current State Snapshot\n[What exists today, pain points]\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n[Key choices made, with rationale]\n\n## Sequential Thread Plan\n\n### Thread 1 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: [level]\n- **Purpose**: [goal]\n- **Actions**: [specific work]\n- **Reference material**: [file paths]\n- **Validation targets**: [how to verify]\n- **Deliverables**: [outputs]\n- **Reasoning effort**: [level] ([model] recommended)\n\n### Thread 2 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: [level]\n[...]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n[Overall success metrics]\n\n## Completion Checklist\nThread 1 — [Name] — [ ] PENDING / [x] COMPLETED (date)\nThread 2 — [Name] — [ ] PENDING\n[...]\n```\n\n## Completion Log Format\n\nWhen a thread is completed, the PRD should be updated with implementation details:\n\n```markdown\n### Thread 3 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: medium\n\n[thread details...]\n\n**Completion Log — Thread 3** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-15)\n- ✅ [What was implemented with specifics]\n- ✅ [Files modified with line references]\n- ✅ [Tests added/passed]\n- ✅ [Validation performed]\n- **Notes**: [Any deviations, decisions made, follow-ups identified]\n- **Next**: Thread 4\n```\n\n## Instructing the Executor\n\nInclude these instructions in the PRD so that executing agents know how to work:\n\n```markdown\n## How to Execute Threads\n\n1. Read this PRD fully before starting\n2. Execute ONE thread per conversation\n3. Start your thread by stating: \"Executing Thread N: [Name]\"\n4. Read all reference material listed for the thread\n5. Complete all actions and validation targets\n6. Update the PRD with completion log before ending\n7. State: \"Thread N complete. Next: Thread N+1\"\n```\n\n## Key Patterns from Effective PRDs\n\n### Pattern: Decision Documentation\n\nWhen threads involve choices, document options with recommendations:\n\n```markdown\n**Key Decision**: Sequence numbering\n- **Option A**: Restart per platform (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2; YouTube_1, YouTube_2) ✅ RECOMMENDED\n- **Option B**: Continuous across platforms (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2; YouTube_3, YouTube_4)\n- **Rationale**: Option A keeps each platform's batch self-contained\n```\n\n### Pattern: Migration Safety\n\nFor changes affecting production systems:\n\n```markdown\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n- Existing records: [How handled]\n- Transition period: [Strategy]\n\n### Rollback Plan\n1. [Step to revert]\n2. [Verification after rollback]\n```\n\n### Pattern: Thread Dependencies\n\nWhen threads must be executed in order:\n\n```markdown\n### Thread 5 — Database Migration — Reasoning Effort: low\n- **Depends on**: Thread 4 (schema design must be finalized)\n- **Blocks**: Threads 6, 7, 8 (all require new schema)\n```\n\n## Self-Contained Thread Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing a thread, verify:\n\n- [ ] Can someone start a fresh conversation and execute this thread with ONLY the PRD?\n- [ ] Are all file paths specified (not \"the config file\" but `config/settings.py:45`)?\n- [ ] Is the reasoning level justified by the task complexity?\n- [ ] Are validation targets specific and testable?\n- [ ] Does the thread avoid scope creep (one focused outcome)?\n\n## Example PRDs\n\nSee [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for excerpts from production PRDs demonstrating these patterns.\n",
        "skills/prd-planner/references/examples.md": "# PRD Examples\n\nExcerpts from production PRDs demonstrating effective patterns.\n\n## Example 1: Phase II Implementation Plan\n\nSource: Multi-platform upload workflow implementation\n\n### Excellent Thread Structure\n\n```markdown\n### 15) Multi-platform post creation — Reasoning Effort: medium ✅ COMPLETED\n\n**Goal**: Create N posts (one per selected platform) from a single upload; share batch_id, unique platform/sequence.\n\n**Acceptance**: Uploading 3 files for LinkedIn + YouTube creates 6 posts total (3 LinkedIn, 3 YouTube); each has correct platform, sequence, video_url.\n\n**Changes**:\n- Modify `admin_api/routers/uploads.py` POST handler:\n  - Loop over selected platforms\n  - For each platform, create posts with platform-specific naming\n  - All posts in a batch share `batch_id`, `metricool_id`, `video_url`, `transcript`\n  - Sequence numbers restart per platform or continue across platforms (decide based on existing pattern)\n- Update filename generation to use platform in canonical pattern (already exists in `file_renamer.py`)\n- Update preview endpoint to show platform breakdown\n\n**Read first**: `social_media_pipeline/admin_tool/file_renamer.py:1`, `social_media_pipeline/admin_api/routers/uploads.py:180-250`, `social_media_pipeline/shared/services/db_service.py:1`\n\n**Key Decision**: Sequence numbering\n- **Option A**: Restart sequence per platform (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2, LinkedIn_3; YouTube_1, YouTube_2, YouTube_3) ✅ IMPLEMENTED\n- **Option B**: Continuous sequence across platforms (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2, LinkedIn_3; YouTube_4, YouTube_5, YouTube_6)\n- **Recommendation**: Option A (restart per platform) for clarity; each platform's batch is self-contained\n```\n\n### Excellent Completion Log\n\n```markdown\n**Completion Log — Step 15**\n- Date: 2025-09-30\n- **SCHEMA CHANGE**: Added `platform` column to `posts` table (TEXT, nullable, indexed)\n- Created migration: `shared/db/migrations/add_platform_to_posts.sql`\n- Created migration documentation: `shared/db/migrations/README.md`\n- Updated Post ORM model with `platform` field and indexes:\n  - `ix_posts_platform` - Platform filtering index\n  - `ix_posts_client_platform_status` - Composite index for common queries\n- Updated `naming.py` canonical pattern to include platform prefix:\n  - Old: `client-{name}__blog-{id}__duration-{sec}sec__batch-{count}__type-{type}__timestamp-{ts}__{original}{ext}`\n  - New: `{Platform}__client-{name}__blog-{id}__batch-{count}__seq-{num}__type-{type}__timestamp-{ts}__{original}{ext}`\n- Tested with comprehensive test suite (`test_step15_multiplatform.py`):\n  - ✅ Schema migration (platform column exists)\n  - ✅ Naming pattern (platform prefix correct)\n  - ✅ Multi-platform logic (N × M posts)\n  - ✅ Preview structure (correct breakdown)\n  - ✅ Duplicate detection (platform-specific)\n- Verified: No linter errors\n- Next step: Step 16 (Remove CTA/hashtag standalone fetching)\n```\n\n**Why this works**:\n- Specific file:line references for reading\n- Clear decision point with recommendation\n- Testable acceptance criteria\n- Detailed completion log with actual changes\n\n---\n\n## Example 2: Models YAML Source-of-Truth Plan\n\nSource: Configuration management incident response\n\n### Excellent Shared Resources Section\n\n```markdown\n## Shared Resources for All Threads\n\n- Repository root: `/Users/michael/Documents/GitHub/plumwheel/social_media_pipeline`\n- Key config file: `config/models.yaml`\n- Python config helpers: `caption_service/utils/config.py`, `shared/config/settings.py`\n- Service entrypoint & logging: `caption_service/main.py`\n- Tests: `social_media_pipeline/tests/` (run with `pytest`)\n- Documentation: `docs/guides/MODEL_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`\n- Containers: `docker compose exec caption-service ...` (for production-style validation)\n```\n\n### Excellent Thread with Model Recommendation\n\n```markdown\n### Thread 2 — Config Resolver Refactor ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-21)\n\n- **Purpose**: Introduce source-aware resolver and logging inside `caption_service/utils/config.py`.\n- **Actions**: Implement resolver helper, surface source metadata, wire INFO log in service startup.\n- **Reference material**: review `caption_service/utils/config.py` (model constants & `_load_models_config()`), `shared/config/settings.py` (env loading order), and existing logging in `caption_service/main.py`.\n- **Validation targets**: `social_media_pipeline/tests/test_bedrock_toggle.py` (imports config constants), new targeted tests under `tests/config/`, manual run of `python -m caption_service.main --show-debug-info` to confirm logging.\n- **Deliverables**: Updated resolver (with per-component source metadata), startup INFO log summarizing resolved models, accompanying docstring/comments, passing tests recorded via `pytest`.\n- **Output**: PR touching config helper + main entrypoint with unit coverage for resolver.\n- **Reasoning effort**: Medium (code comprehension & refactor; Sonnet 3.7/4.0 recommended).\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- ✅ Created `_resolve_model()` and `_resolve_fallback_model()` functions that track resolution source\n- ✅ Added `_model_resolution_sources` dict to track which source (env/yaml/default) was used for each model\n- ✅ Implemented `get_model_resolution()` function to expose resolution metadata\n- ✅ Implemented `format_model_resolution_table()` to create human-readable table output\n- ✅ Added startup logging in `caption_service/main.py:initialize_services()` that displays full model configuration table\n```\n\n**Why this works**:\n- Explicit model recommendation in reasoning effort\n- Multiple validation targets\n- Reference material describes WHY to read each file\n- Implementation details serve as context for future threads\n\n---\n\n## Example 3: Admin Captioning HIL Workflow Plan\n\nSource: Human-in-the-loop captioning workflow\n\n### Excellent Sequential Checklist Format\n\n```markdown\n## Sequential Thinking Checklist (One Thread per Step)\n\nThread 1 — DB migrations — ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-31)\n- ✅ Confirmed current schema (001_initial_migration.py reviewed)\n- ✅ Created Alembic migration 002_components_platforms_api_costs_precision_cost_indexes.py\n- ✅ Added `components.platforms TEXT[]` with GIN index for array queries\n- ✅ Added backfill logic: `UPDATE components SET platforms = ARRAY[platform]`\n- ✅ Added platform consistency check constraint\n- ✅ Changed `api_costs.cost_usd` to NUMERIC(10,4) for currency precision\n- ✅ Added indexes: `ix_api_costs_model`, `ix_api_costs_operation`\n- ✅ Rollback plan implemented in downgrade() function\n- ✅ Migration guide created: MIGRATION_GUIDE.md\n- 📋 Ready for application: `alembic upgrade head`\n\nThread 2 — ORM/service parity — ✅ COMPLETED\n- ✅ Updated shared/db/models.py: Added `platforms` TEXT[] to Component\n- ✅ Added GIN index on Component.platforms\n- ✅ Updated NotionCompatService.get_pipeline_component to prefer platforms[]\n- ✅ Verified models import correctly and service initializes without errors\n\nThread 3 — Captions HIL — ✅ COMPLETED\n- ✅ Added `/notes` and `/recaption` endpoints with validation\n- ✅ Save notes → persisted in `feedback_summary`, timestamp bumps\n- ✅ Recaption requires non‑empty notes; sets status correctly\n```\n\n**Why this works**:\n- Clear status indicators (✅, 📋, ⬜)\n- Actionable completion items\n- Serves as context for subsequent threads\n- Date stamps for tracking\n\n---\n\n## Example 4: Execution Instructions Block\n\nInclude this in every PRD so executing agents know the protocol:\n\n```markdown\n## How to Execute Threads\n\n1.

        "skills/skill-manager/SKILL.md": "---\nname: skill-manager\ndescription: Manage, sync, and publish Agent Skills across multiple AI platforms (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot) and tiered marketplaces. Use when users want to list skills, sync between platforms, publish skills to private/team/public marketplaces, audit skill versions, or set up their environment. Triggers on phrases like \"list skills\", \"sync skills\", \"publish skill\", \"skill marketplace\", \"deploy skill\", \"audit skills\", or \"skill inventory\".\n---\n\n# Skill Manager\n\nManage Agent Skills across multiple AI platforms and tiered marketplace repositories.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n1. **Multi-Platform Sync** - Deploy skills across Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot\n2. **Inventory** - Discover and list all skills across platform locations\n3. **Publish** - Push skills to tiered GitHub marketplace repositories (private/team/public)\n4. **Marketplace Distribute** - Make marketplace-installed skills available to other AI platforms via symlinks\n5. **Audit** - Compare skill versions, detect drift, identify inconsistencies\n6. **Validate** - Check skill compliance with the Agent Skills specification\n\n## Source of Truth: How Syncing Works\n\nSkill-manager uses a **single source of truth** model. You designate one platform as your \"source\" where you create and edit skills, and skill-manager syncs them one-way to other platforms.\n\n**Why one-way sync?**\n- Prevents conflicts when the same skill exists on multiple platforms\n- Clear ownership: you always know where the authoritative version lives\n- Simple mental model: edit in one place, distribute everywhere\n\n**Example:** If Claude Code is your source of truth:\n- Create and edit skills in `~/.claude/skills/`\n- Run `scripts/sync.py --all` to distribute to Codex, Gemini, Copilot\n- Skills created directly in `~/.codex/skills/` will NOT sync back to Claude\n\n**If you accidentally create a skill on the wrong platform:**\n1. Copy it manually to your source platform's skills directory\n2. Run sync to distribute it properly\n3. Optionally delete the original from the non-source platform\n\n**To change your source of truth:** Edit `config.json` and set `\"is_source\": true` on your preferred platform (and `false` on all others), or re-run `scripts/init.py`.\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\n| Platform | User Skills Path | Detection |\n|----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/` exists |\n| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/` exists |\n| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `~/.gemini/` exists |\n| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `~/.copilot/` exists |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### First-Time Setup\n\nRun the interactive setup wizard:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init.py\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Detect installed AI platforms on your system\n2. Choose which platform is your \"source of truth\"\n3. Configure which platforms to sync skills to\n4. Set sync mode (symlink or copy)\n5. Optionally configure marketplace repositories\n\n### Sync Skills Between Platforms\n\nAfter setup, sync a skill from your source platform to all configured targets:\n\n```bash\nscripts/sync.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n```\n\nOr sync all skills at once:\n\n```bash\nscripts/sync.py --all\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--to claude,codex,gemini,copilot` - Override target platforms\n- `--to auto` - Auto-detect installed platforms\n- `--to all` - Sync to all known platforms\n- `--mode symlink|copy` - Override sync mode\n- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying\n- `--force` - Overwrite existing skills without prompting\n- `--all` - Sync all skills from source platform\n\n### List All Skills\n\n```bash\nscripts/inventory.py\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--platform claude|codex|gemini|copilot|all` - Filter by platform\n- `--format table|json|yaml` - Output format\n- `--verbose` - Show full paths and metadata\n\n## Tiered Marketplace System\n\nSkills can be published to three tiers with different access levels:\n\n| Tier | Visibility | Use Case |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| **Private** | Only you | Personal/experimental skills |\n| **Team** | Collaborators | Shared skills for your team |\n| **Public** | Anyone | Open source skills for the community |\n\nEach tier is a separate GitHub repository that functions as a Claude Code marketplace.\n\n### Publish a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/publish.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill --tier team\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Copy the skill to your team marketplace repo\n2. Update marketplace.json\n3. Update the README.md \"Available Skills\" table (for new skills)\n4. Create a PR for review\n5. Sync to other platforms (if configured)\n\nIf you don't specify `--tier`, you'll be prompted to choose.\n\n**Note on README updates:** When publishing a new skill, the README.md is automatically updated with the skill's entry in the \"Available Skills\" table. For updates to existing skills, README changes are optional and only made if the skill's description has changed.\n\n### Sync Marketplace Repos\n\nPull latest from your marketplace repositories:\n\n```bash\nscripts/marketplace-sync.py\nscripts/marketplace-sync.py --tier team\nscripts/marketplace-sync.py --status\n```\n\n### Distribute Marketplace Skills to Other Platforms\n\nMake skills from your local marketplace clones available to other AI assistants (Codex, Gemini, Copilot) via symlinks. Claude Code is skipped by default since it has native marketplace access.\n\n```bash\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py                       # Distribute all marketplace skills\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --marketplace team    # Only from team marketplace\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --skill my-skill      # Only distribute one skill\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --to codex,gemini     # Only to specific platforms\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --dry-run             # Preview what would happen\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --list                # List available marketplace skills\nscripts/marketplace-distribute.py --status              # Show distribution status\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--marketplace NAME` - Only distribute from specific marketplace\n- `--skill NAME` - Only distribute a specific skill by name\n- `--to PLATFORMS` - Target platforms: codex, gemini, copilot, all\n- `--include-claude` - Also create symlinks for Claude (normally skipped)\n- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying\n- `--force` - Overwrite existing skills without prompting\n- `--list` - List available marketplace skills\n- `--status` - Show current distribution status\n\n**How it works:**\n- Scans your local marketplace repo clones (`~/GitHub/skills-*`)\n- Creates symlinks in target platform skill directories pointing to marketplace skills\n- Skips Claude Code by default (it already has access via the plugin system)\n\n### Audit Skills for Drift\n\n```bash\nscripts/audit.py <skill-name>\nscripts/audit.py --all\n```\n\n### Validate a Skill\n\n```bash\nscripts/validate.py <skill-path>\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is stored in `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"platforms\": {\n    \"claude\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"user_path\": \"~/.claude/skills\",\n      \"is_source\": true\n    },\n    \"codex\": {\n      \"enabled\": true,\n      \"user_path\": \"~/.codex/skills\",\n      \"is_source\": false\n    },\n    \"gemini\": {\n      \"enabled\": false,\n      \"user_path\": \"~/.gemini/skills\",\n      \"is_source\": false\n    },\n    \"copilot\": {\n      \"enabled\": false,\n      \"user_path\": \"~/.copilot/skills\",\n      \"is_source\": false\n    }\n  },\n  \"sync_mode\": \"symlink\",\n  \"marketplaces\": {\n    \"private\": {\n      \"repo\": \"https://github.com/you/skills-private\",\n      \"description\": \"Personal/experimental skills\",\n      \"visibility\": \"private\"\n    },\n    \"team\": {\n      \"repo\": \"https://github.com/your-org/skills-team\",\n      \"description\": \"Shared skills for collaborators\",\n      \"visibility\": \"private\"\n    },\n    \"public\": {\n      \"repo\": \"https://github.com/your-org/skills-public\",\n      \"description\": \"Freely available skills\",\n      \"visibility\": \"public\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"name\": \"Your Name\",\n    \"email\": \"you@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"local_repos_path\": \"~/GitHub\"\n}\n```\n\n### Config Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `platforms` | Platform configurations (enabled, path, source) |\n| `sync_mode` | Default sync mode: `symlink` or `copy` |\n| `marketplaces` | GitHub repo URLs for each tier |\n| `owner` | Your name and email for commits |\n| `local_repos_path` | Where marketplace repos are cloned |\n\n## Marketplace Repository Structure\n\nEach marketplace repo follows this structure:\n\n```\nskills-{tier}/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json    # Plugin catalog\n├── skills/\n│   ├── skill-one/\n│   │   ├── SKILL.md\n│   │   └── scripts/\n│   └── skill-two/\n│       └── SKILL.md\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### marketplace.json Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"skills-team\",\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"name\": \"Your Name\",\n    \"email\": \"you@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"description\": \"Shared skills for collaborators\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"plugins\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"skills-team\",\n      \"description\": \"Shared skills for collaborators\",\n      \"source\": \"./\",\n      \"strict\": false,\n      \"skills\": [\n        \"./skills/skill-one\",\n        \"./skills/skill-two\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Workflow: Publishing Skills\n\n### Step 1: Develop Locally\n\nCreate and test your skill in your source platform's skills directory:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Required\n├── scripts/           # Optional\n├── references/        # Optional\n└── assets/            # Optional\n```\n\n### Step 2: Validate\n\n```bash\nscripts/validate.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n```\n\n### Step 3: Publish\n\n```bash\nscripts/publish.py ~/.claude/skills/my-skill --tier team\n```\n\n### Step 4: Merge PR\n\nReview and merge the PR created in your marketplace repo.\n\n### Step 5: Users Install\n\nUsers add your marketplace and install:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add your-org/skills-team\n```\n\nThen browse skills in the `/plugin` UI under the Discover tab.\n\n## Cross-Platform Skill Development\n\n### Writing Portable Skills\n\n- Avoid hardcoding platform-specific paths\n- Use environment detection if behavior must differ\n- Test on multiple platforms before publishing\n\n### Sync Modes\n\n| Mode | Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|------|\n| **symlink** | Changes propagate instantly, saves disk space | Requires symlink support |\n| **copy** | Works everywhere, independent copies | Must re-sync to propagate changes |\n\n### Skill Specification Compliance\n\n| Field | Required | Max Length | Rules |\n|-------|----------|------------|-------|\n| `name` | Yes | 64 chars | Lowercase, hyphens, digits only |\n| `description` | Yes | 1024 chars | No angle brackets.

Marketplace skills (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/skills/`)\n\n## OpenAI Codex\n\n### Global Skills\n\n**Path:** `~/.codex/skills/`\n\nUser-created skills available to all Codex sessions.\n\n```\n~/.codex/\n└── skills/\n    ├── my-skill-a/\n    │   └── SKILL.md\n    └── my-skill-b/\n        └── SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Invocation\n\n- List skills: `/skills` command\n- Explicit invoke: `$skill-name` in conversation\n- Implicit: Auto-detected from description keywords\n\n## Cross-Platform Considerations\n\n### Identical Structure\n\nThe skill directory structure is identical across platforms:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required\n├── scripts/              # Optional\n├── references/           # Optional\n└── assets/               # Optional\n```\n\n### Portable SKILL.md\n\nThe frontmatter format is identical:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: skill-name\ndescription: Description with WHAT and WHEN triggers.\n---\n\n# Instructions here\n```\n\n### Scripts Compatibility\n\nScripts should be platform-agnostic where possible:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\n\n# Detect platform if needed\ndef get_platform():\n    if os.path.exists(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude')):\n        return 'claude'\n    elif os.path.exists(os.path.expanduser('~/.codex')):\n        return 'codex'\n    return 'unknown'\n\n# Platform-agnostic home\ndef get_skills_home():\n    platform = get_platform()\n    home = os.path.expanduser('~')\n    return os.path.join(home, f'.{platform}', 'skills')\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```\nCLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR    # Override ~/.claude location\n```\n\n### Codex\n\n```\nCODEX_CONFIG_DIR     # Override ~/.codex location (if supported)\n```\n\n## Symlink Strategy\n\nFor maintaining skills across platforms from a single source:\n\n```bash\n# Create source repository\nmkdir -p ~/projects/my-skills/skill-a\n# ... create SKILL.md and resources\n\n# Symlink to Claude Code\nln -s ~/projects/my-skills/skill-a ~/.claude/skills/skill-a\n\n# Symlink to Codex\nln -s ~/projects/my-skills/skill-a ~/.codex/skills/skill-a\n```\n\nAdvantages:\n- Single source of truth\n- Changes propagate instantly\n- Version control in one location\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Broken symlinks if source moves\n- Platform-specific changes not possible\n\n## File System Permissions\n\n### Recommended Permissions\n\n```bash\n# Skill directories\nchmod 755 ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\nchmod 755 ~/.codex/skills/my-skill\n\n# SKILL.md and references\nchmod 644 ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Executable scripts\nchmod 755 ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py\nchmod 755 ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.sh\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Skill Not Discovered\n\n1. Verify SKILL.md exists and has valid frontmatter\n2. Check directory permissions\n3. Ensure name field matches directory name\n4. Restart agent session (some platforms cache skill list)\n\n### Symlink Issues\n\n```bash\n# Check if symlink is valid\nls -la ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n\n# Check target exists\nls -la $(readlink ~/.claude/skills/my-skill)\n\n# Fix broken symlink\nrm ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\nln -s /correct/path ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n```\n\n### Permission Denied on Scripts\n\n```bash\n# Make scripts executable\nchmod +x ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py\n```\n"
