        "README.md": "# Skills Marketplace: Public\n\nA free, curated collection of skills for Claude Code and other AI coding assistants.\n\n## What Are Skills?\n\nSkills are instructions that teach AI assistants how to perform specific tasks. When you install a skill, your AI assistant gains new capabilities - like knowing how to deploy to your server, follow your team's coding standards, or use your project's specific tools.\n\nThink of skills like browser extensions, but for AI assistants. They extend what your AI can do.\n\n### Write Once, Use Everywhere\n\nSkills follow the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), an open standard supported by multiple AI coding assistants including Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot. This means:\n\n- **One skill works across all platforms** - Write a skill once and use it with any supported AI assistant\n- **No vendor lock-in** - Your skills aren't tied to a single tool\n- **Portable workflows** - Switch between AI assistants without losing your custom capabilities\n- **Automatic syncing** - Use the `skill-manager` skill to automatically distribute skills across all your AI tools with a single command\n\n## Quick Start (5 minutes)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) installed (the CLI or VS Code extension)\n- A terminal or VS Code\n\n### Step 1: Add This Marketplace\n\nOpen Claude Code and run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add jmichaelschmidt/skills-public\n```\n\nThis tells Claude Code where to find skills. You only need to do this once.\n\n### Step 2: Browse and Install Skills\n\nRun:\n\n```\n/plugin\n```\n\nThis opens the plugin browser. Use the arrow keys to navigate:\n- Go to the **Discover** tab to see available skills\n- Select a skill and press Enter to see details\n- Choose \"Install for you (user scope)\" to install it for all your projects\n\n### Step 3: Use Your New Skills\n\nOnce installed, the skill is automatically active. Just ask Claude to do something the skill enables, or ask it to explain the skill to you.\n\n**Example - ask about a skill:**\n> \"How does the skill-manager skill work?\"\n\nYour AI assistant will read the skill's instructions and explain its capabilities, commands, and how to use it.\n\n**Example - use a skill:**\n> \"List all my installed skills\"\n\nor\n\n> \"Sync my skills to Codex\"\n\nClaude will automatically use the skill's instructions to complete the task.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [prd-planner](skills/prd-planner/) | Generate structured PRD planning documents optimized for AI-assisted development. Creates discrete, single-conversation tasks with reasoning level estimates to optimize token usage and model selection. |\n| [skill-manager](skills/skill-manager/) | Manage, sync, and publish Agent Skills across multiple AI platforms. Write a skill once in Claude Code, then distribute it to Codex, Gemini CLI, and Copilot simultaneously. |\n\n## Trust & Security\n\n### Curated by Collaborators\n\nThis is a **curated marketplace**, not an open publishing platform. Skills are added by known collaborators and reviewed before being merged. We don't accept unsolicited skill submissions from the general public.\n\nThis approach ensures:\n\n- **No malicious instructions** - We review for prompt injection, data exfiltration attempts, and other security risks\n- **No harmful commands** - Skills that run destructive commands must include appropriate warnings and confirmations\n- **Transparent behavior** - Skills do what they claim to do, nothing more\n- **Quality standards** - Skills are well-documented and actually useful\n\n### How We Review Skills\n\nEvery skill is reviewed before being added. We check for:\n\n1. **Security risks** - Prompt injection, attempts to override safety guidelines, hidden instructions\n2. **Data safety** - No sending user data to external services without clear disclosure\n3. **Destructive operations** - Any commands that delete, overwrite, or modify system files must have safeguards\n4. **Credential handling** - Skills must not log, transmit, or mishandle sensitive information\n5. **Accuracy** - The skill description must match what it actually does\n\n### Your Responsibility\n\nEven with our review process, you should:\n\n- **Read a skill before installing** - Check the SKILL.md to understand what it does\n- **Review any scripts** - If a skill includes scripts, inspect them before running\n- **Report concerns** - If you notice suspicious behavior, [open an issue](https://github.com/jmichaelschmidt/skills-public/issues)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### For Collaborators\n\nIf you're a collaborator on this repository, you can add skills directly or via pull request. Please follow the skill structure and guidelines below.\n\n### Interested in Contributing?\n\nIf you've built a skill you think would be valuable here, [open an issue](https://github.com/jmichaelschmidt/skills-public/issues) to start a conversation. We may invite you as a collaborator if it's a good fit.\n\n### Skill Structure\n\n```\nskills/\n└── your-skill-name/\n    ├── SKILL.md        # Required - the skill instructions\n    ├── scripts/        # Optional - helper scripts\n    └── references/     # Optional - reference docs\n```\n\n### SKILL.md Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: A short description of what this skill does and when to use it.\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\nInstructions for the AI assistant go here...\n```\n\n### Skill Guidelines\n\nGood skills are:\n\n- **Focused** - Do one thing well\n- **Clear** - Write instructions the AI can follow unambiguously\n- **Safe** - Include warnings for destructive operations; never hide behavior\n- **Documented** - Explain what the skill does, when to use it, and any prerequisites\n- **Cross-platform** - Avoid hardcoding paths or platform-specific assumptions when possible\n\n## Installing Skills Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use the `/plugin` UI, you can install skills manually:\n\n1. Clone this repo or download a skill folder\n2. Copy it to `~/.claude/skills/`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\nFor other platforms:\n- **Codex**: `~/.codex/skills/`\n- **Gemini CLI**: `~/.gemini/skills/`\n- **GitHub Copilot**: `~/.copilot/skills/`\n\nOr use the `skill-manager` skill to sync across all platforms automatically.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Marketplace not found\" error\n\nMake sure you added the marketplace first:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add jmichaelschmidt/skills-public\n```\n\n### Skill not appearing after install\n\n1. Try reloading your IDE window (VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` → \"Reload Window\")\n2. In `/plugin`, go to Marketplaces tab and press `u` to update\n\n### \"Authentication failed\" for private repos\n\nThis marketplace is public, so no authentication is needed. If you're trying to add a private marketplace, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your environment.\n\n## Learn More\n\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) - Technical spec for skill authors\n\n## License\n\nSkills in this marketplace are provided as-is.
