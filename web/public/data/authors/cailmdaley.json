        "README.md": "# Skills\n\nAgent skills for research work — autonomous iteration, scientific visualization, bibliography management, image generation, and more. Currently packaged as a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin, but the skills themselves are just markdown files that any coding agent can use.\n\n**Read each skill before you run it.** These skills shape how your agent works. **ralph-loops and confer run agents with no permission gates** — they bypass all approval checks and sandboxing. Understand what a skill does before activating it.\n\n**These reflect one person's workflow, not universal best practices.** Fork the repo, delete what doesn't fit, rewrite what almost fits. The best skills are the ones you've made your own.\n\n```bash\n# Claude Code\nclaude plugin marketplace add cailmdaley/skills\nclaude plugin install research-skills\n\n# Codex (no plugin system — symlink the skills directory)\ngit clone https://github.com/cailmdaley/skills.git ~/.local/share/skills\nln -s ~/.local/share/skills/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/\n```\n\n## What's here\n\n### constitution + ralph-loops — Autonomous iteration\n\nTwo skills that work together. **constitution** is the design document — a markdown spec describing the desired state, written to outlast any single iteration. **ralph-loops** is the execution engine — fresh-context loops that survey reality, contribute, and exit, repeating until the constitution is satisfied.\n\nUse the **constitution** skill to draft a spec: \"use the constitution skill to help me write a spec for [your goal].\" Then launch with the included `ralph` script, which runs in a tmux session with support for both Claude Code and Codex backends. Attach to watch, steer, or update the spec mid-run.\n\nPattern adapted from [Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/).\n\n### confer — Cross-agent collaboration\n\nConsult the other coding agent — Claude Code calls Codex, Codex calls Claude Code. One-shot mode for quick questions, reviews, or dispatched tasks; tmux session mode for extended back-and-forth collaboration.\n\n### data-visualization — Scientific figure design\n\nA decision framework synthesizing Bertin, Cleveland, Tufte, Cairo, Wilke, and Knaflic. Routes from data type to visualization form, with cosmology-specific conventions (power spectra, covariance matrices, triangle plots, sky maps). Includes a visualization catalog, color palette reference, and design system.\n\n### implementing-code — Scientific coding standards\n\nOpinionated approach to research code: conceptual density, concise conditionals, natural line breaking. Write it right the first time — clean, correct, no post-hoc cleanup needed.\n\n### managing-bibliography — arXiv + ADS citation management\n\nRead full paper source from arXiv, fetch BibTeX from NASA ADS, generate citation keys, append to your `.bib` file. Requires `$ADS_API_TOKEN`.\n\n### nano-banana — Image generation via Gemini CLI\n\nGenerate and edit images using Gemini CLI with persistent visual memory via KV cache warmth. Two warm caches (Gemini's KV cache + Claude's context) enable iterative refinement. Includes transparency extraction via difference matting.\n\nRequires [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) with the [nanobanana extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana).\n\n### pocket-tts — Local text-to-speech\n\nSpeak text aloud using pocket-tts server with streaming audio. macOS only.\n\nRequires: `pip install pocket-tts`, `brew install ffmpeg`, a voice file at `~/.config/pocket-tts/default-voice.wav`.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
