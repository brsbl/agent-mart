        "README.md": "# React Native Upgrader\n\nA [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that automates React Native upgrades using AI-powered analysis and execution.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Two-phase approach** — Analyze the upgrade impact before committing to changes\n- **Smart diff application** — Uses [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge) diffs to apply precise, version-to-version changes\n- **Release notes summary** — Fetches and summarizes breaking changes across all intermediate versions\n- **Complexity assessment** — Rates upgrades as Simple, Moderate, or Complex so you know what to expect\n- **Safe skip strategy** — Preserves your source code (App.tsx, src/, etc.) and only modifies template/config files\n- **Multi-package-manager support** — Automatically detects and works with npm, yarn, pnpm, and Bun\n- **Error recovery** — Handles failures gracefully with clear reporting and manual fallback options\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin add webartdesign/react-native-upgrader\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFrom your React Native project directory, start Claude Code and ask it to upgrade:\n\n```\nupgrade React Native to 0.79\n```\n\nOther trigger phrases that activate the skill:\n\n- \"analyze what upgrading React Native involves\"\n- \"migrate to React Native 0.78\"\n- \"update RN version\"\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Phase 1: Analysis (always runs)\n\n1. **Detects versions** — Reads your current version from `package.json` and validates the target\n2. **Validates the diff** — Fetches the rn-diff-purge diff between your current and target versions\n3. **Summarizes release notes** — Dispatches a subagent to fetch release notes for all intermediate versions and identify breaking changes\n4. **Presents a summary** — Shows complexity assessment, breaking changes, and asks if you want to proceed\n\n### Phase 2: Execution (opt-in)\n\n1. **Applies the diff** — Updates dependencies, configuration files, Android native code, and iOS native code in sequence\n2. **Skips user code** — Leaves your application source files untouched\n3. **Runs cleanup** — Reinstalls dependencies, runs `pod install`, cleans Gradle and Metro caches\n4. **Reports results** — Lists all modified files, skipped files, and any remaining manual steps\n\n## When NOT to Use\n\n- **Expo managed workflow** — Use `expo upgrade` or `npx expo install` instead\n- **Single dependency updates** — This is for full React Native version upgrades, not individual package updates\n- **Brownfield / hybrid apps** — Assumes a standard RN template structure; heavily customized native projects need manual planning\n- **Downgrading** — Only supports upgrading to newer versions\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
