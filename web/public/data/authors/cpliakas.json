        "README.md": "# Claude Code Digital Coworkers\n\n> **Hypothesis**: Similar to how public cloud redefined what one ops engineer could manage, AI agents may redefine what one IC can take on by delegating to digital specialists that learn on the job.\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace of reusable **digital coworkers**: specialist agents and skills that can be installed across projects. Each coworker brings generic domain expertise while accumulating project-specific memory on the job.\n\n## About This Project\n\nThis is a personal learning project. Building agents, wiring them together, and watching where they break is how I develop intuition for what works and what doesn't. The agents here are opinionated to a specific stack and working style and aren't designed for broad adoption.\n\nIf you're looking for well-maintained, general-purpose collections of Claude Code agents and skills, these are better starting points:\n\n- [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents), a curated agent library\n- [affaan-m/everything-claude-code](https://github.com/AffaanM/everything-claude-code), a comprehensive Claude Code resource collection\n- [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents), a community-maintained subagent catalog\n\n## What I'm Testing\n\n### Team structure, not isolated specialists\n\nMost agent collections are flat lists where each agent is independent and self-contained. Here, agents are organized as a team with explicit roles, hierarchy, and delegation chains defined in their markdown files.\n\nThe `cloud-engineering-aws` plugin illustrates this. `devops-lead` sets tool-agnostic principles (deployment strategies, observability requirements, IaC standards). `aws-solutions-architect` translates those principles into AWS-specific architecture decisions, consulting `devops-lead` to validate that its recommendations serve broader DevOps patterns. `cloudformation-specialist` implements what the architect specifies, consulting upstream when unsure whether a design choice (e.g., nested vs. separate stacks) is correct. Each agent's `Delegation` section names who it delegates to and who it consults, so the chain is explicit and inspectable.\n\nAcross plugins, the same pattern holds at different levels. `product-owner` advises on sequencing and priorities but never implements, acting as a consultative agent that checks proposed work against the roadmap. `qa-lead` owns the full test lifecycle and consults `security-engineer` for security-related tests. `security-engineer` doesn't delegate at all and exists as a leaf node consulted by others during review cycles.\n\n### Benchmark harness for measurable agent quality\n\nAgent definitions are easy to write and hard to evaluate. The benchmark harness (`benchmark/benchmark.py`) provides a structured way to test whether an agent's knowledge and reasoning actually hold up.\n\nThe approach is config-driven. Each benchmark is a **suite**: a `suite.yaml` that defines prompt templates, scoring criteria, and dataset field mappings, plus a dataset of question-answer pairs. The harness sends each scenario to the agent, then passes the agent's response to a separate LLM judge for scoring. Adding a new suite requires no harness code changes, just a config file and a dataset.\n\nTwo scoring modes exist today. **Binary** mode checks correctness: did the agent recommend the right AWS services for the scenario? **Dimensional** mode scores across multiple quality axes (answer accuracy, cost surfacing, specificity, pillar coverage, risk classification, structured format) on a 1-5 scale, with aggregate statistics and weakness keyword analysis.\n\nThe current suite tests `aws-solutions-architect` against 494 SAA-C03 exam scenarios. The intention is to make this generic so that any agent can take a suite of benchmarks, creating a real validation loop rather than undifferentiated agent definitions. See [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md) for the full CLI reference and how to create new suites.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAdd the marketplace to your Claude Code project, then install the plugins you need:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add cpliakas/claude-code-digital-coworkers\n/plugin install security-engineer@digital-coworkers\n/plugin install qa-lead@digital-coworkers\n/plugin install product-owner@digital-coworkers\n/plugin install cloud-engineering-aws@digital-coworkers\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\n### security-engineer\n\nSecurity specialist for vulnerability detection and code security review.\n\n| Type | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| Agent | `security-engineer` | Catches vulnerabilities before they ship (OWASP Top 10, dependency risk, secret detection) |\n| Skill | `/security-scan` | Run a security checklist against staged changes, a branch diff, or a specific file |\n\n### qa-lead\n\nQA lead for test strategy and test lifecycle management.\n\n| Type | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| Agent | `qa-lead` | QA lead covering test strategy, fixture design, mocking, coverage analysis, and flakiness diagnosis |\n\n### product-owner\n\nProduct owner for roadmap planning, requirement authoring, and structured output for issue tracking.\n\n| Type | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| Agent | `product-owner` | Roadmap keeper that advises on sequencing, priorities, and phase transitions |\n| Skill | `/write-epic` | Write an epic specification with structured metadata compatible with GitHub Issues and Jira |\n| Skill | `/write-story` | Write a user story with INVEST validation and structured metadata compatible with GitHub Issues and Jira |\n| Skill | `/decompose-requirement` | Decompose an epic into stories, or a story into subtasks, each with structured metadata |\n\n### cloud-engineering-aws\n\nAWS cloud infrastructure agents covering DevOps strategy, solutions architecture, and CloudFormation implementation.\n\n| Type | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| Agent | `devops-lead` | Infrastructure team lead for CI/CD, deployment strategies, and environment management |\n| Agent | `aws-solutions-architect` | AWS Well-Architected Framework specialist for service selection, cost optimization, and security posture |\n| Agent | `cloudformation-specialist` | CF template authoring covering stack lifecycle, drift detection, and nested stacks |\n| Skill | `/lookup-aws-service` | Look up AWS service capability cards for service selection decisions |\n| Skill | `/cf-lint` | Validate a CloudFormation template against best practices and common errors |\n| Skill | `/well-architected-review` | Evaluate infrastructure changes against all 6 Well-Architected pillars |\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Agents vs Skills\n\n| | Agent | Skill |\n|---|---|---|\n| **What** | A specialist persona with domain expertise | A repeatable procedure / SOP |\n| **Memory** | Yes, learns across sessions | No, runs the same way each time |\n| **Judgment** | Yes, decides *how* to approach problems | No, follows a defined process |\n| **Think of it as** | An IC you hired | A runbook in a wiki |\n\n**Rule of thumb**: If it needs to *learn and decide*, it's an agent. If it needs to *execute a procedure*, it's a skill.\n\n### Agent Hierarchy\n\nAgents form teams with clear delegation chains:\n\n1. **Strategic lead** sets principles, tool-agnostic (e.g., `devops-lead`)\n2. **Domain specialist** applies a specific technology (e.g., `aws-solutions-architect`)\n3. **Implementation specialist** executes the solution (e.g., `cloudformation-specialist`)\n\n### Memory\n\nAll agents use `memory: project`. The agent definition is shared via the plugin, but each project maintains its own memory in `.claude/agent-memory/`. Generic learnings stay in the agent definition; project-specific learnings stay in project memory.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nA generic test harness for evaluating agent quality against domain-specific datasets. Each benchmark is a **suite** consisting of a config file and a dataset, with no harness code changes needed.\n\n```bash\ncd benchmark\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Dry run (no API calls)\npython3 benchmark.py suites/aws-solutions-architect --dry-run --sample 3\n\n# Run direct mode on 20 random questions\npython3 benchmark.py suites/aws-solutions-architect --mode direct --sample 20\n\n# Run with tool use enabled (agent can look up AWS service capabilities)\npython3 benchmark.py suites/aws-solutions-architect --mode reasoning --tools --sample 20\n```\n\n| Suite | Agent | Questions | Description |\n|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| `aws-solutions-architect` | `aws-solutions-architect` | 494 | SAA-C03 exam scenarios |\n\nSee [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md) for the full CLI reference and how to create new suites.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nclaude-code-digital-coworkers/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json\n├── README.md\n├── CLAUDE.md\n├── benchmark/\n│   ├── README.md\n│   ├── benchmark.py\n│   ├── requirements.txt\n│   ├── tools/\n│   │   └── parse_questions.py\n│   └── suites/\n│       └── aws-solutions-architect/\n│           ├── suite.yaml\n│           └── questions.json\n└── plugins/\n    ├── security-engineer/\n    │   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n    │   ├── agents/\n    │   │   └── security-engineer.md\n    │   └── skills/\n    │       └── security-scan/SKILL.md\n    ├── qa-lead/\n    │   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n    │   └── agents/\n    │       └── qa-lead.md\n    ├── product-owner/\n    │   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n    │   ├── agents/\n    │   │   └── product-owner.md\n    │   └── skills/\n    │       ├── write-epic/SKILL.md\n    │       ├── write-story/SKILL.md\n    │       └── decompose-requirement/SKILL.md\n    └── cloud-engineering-aws/\n        ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n        ├── agents/\n        │   ├── devops-lead.md\n        │   ├── aws-solutions-architect.md\n        │   └── cloudformation-specialist.md\n        └── skills/\n            ├── cf-lint/SKILL.md\n            ├── lookup-aws-service/\n            │   ├── SKILL.md\n            │   └── data/\n            │       ├── compute.json\n            │       ├── database.json\n            │       ├── storage.json\n            │       └── ...

        "plugins/product-owner/README.md": "# product-owner\n\nA Claude Code plugin that brings product ownership discipline to AI-assisted development: roadmap awareness, requirement quality, and structured output designed to flow into GitHub Issues and Jira.\n\n## What this plugin does\n\n**This is a product owner, not a product manager.** The decisions about what to build and why are yours: product vision, market positioning, strategic feature bets. Once direction is set, the product owner takes over, sequencing the backlog, scoping requirements precisely, and ensuring work is broken down into increments the team can actually ship.\n\nMost AI coding tools jump straight to implementation. This plugin inserts the product ownership layer that should come first: Is this scoped correctly? Is it sequenced properly? Is it broken down into work that can actually ship?\n\nThe plugin has two modes:\n\n**Work sequencing:** The `product-owner` agent reads your roadmap and advises on ordering, prerequisites, and phase transitions. It pushes back when proposed work skips a dependency or conflicts with what's planned next. It doesn't decide what to build or why; it organizes and sequences the work within the direction you've already set.\n\n**Requirement authoring:** Three skills (`/write-epic`, `/write-story`, `/decompose-requirement`) formalize requirements into structured specifications. Output is designed to be filed directly in issue tracking systems without manual reformatting.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThis plugin sits at the top of a three-layer stack:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Layer 3 · PRODUCT INTELLIGENCE          (this plugin)      │\n│  Requirements quality, structured output, roadmap context   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Layer 2 · WORKFLOW SKILLS               (official plugins) │\n│  github · atlassian — spec-to-backlog, triage, bulk ops     │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Layer 1 · API ACCESS                    (official plugins) │\n│  github · atlassian MCP tools — create issue, update field  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nThis plugin owns Layer 3 only. It produces high-quality requirement artifacts and never calls an API or creates an issue itself. That separation keeps this plugin platform-agnostic and lets the official GitHub and Atlassian Claude Code plugins handle filing without duplication.\n\n## How the pieces fit together\n\n### The agent: sequencing layer\n\nThe `product-owner` agent is a consultative peer, not an implementer. It maintains a roadmap in project memory and uses it to evaluate every significant work request before coding begins.\n\nInvoke it before starting non-trivial work:\n\n> \"Should we build the notification system now, or does the event pipeline need to come first?\"\n\nInvoke it after completing significant work:\n\n> \"We finished the order approval flow. What's next?\"\n\nWhen the conversation turns to authoring requirements, the agent delegates to the skills below.\n\n### The skills: authoring layer\n\nThe three skills form a natural progression from broad to specific:\n\n```\nFeature idea\n    │\n    ▼\n/write-epic ──────────── Scope the initiative\n    │                    Problem statement, success metrics,\n    │                    in/out of scope, dependencies\n    │\n    ▼\n/decompose-requirement ── Break it into children\n    │                     Epic → stories (5–15)\n    │                     Story → subtasks (2–8)\n    │                     Sequenced by dependency, risk, value\n    │\n    ▼\n/write-story ──────────── Formalize each work item\n                          INVEST validation, Given/When/Then\n                          acceptance criteria, technical notes\n```\n\nEach skill produces output in the **Requirement Interchange Format (RIF)**: a YAML frontmatter block containing machine-parseable metadata, followed by a human-readable markdown body. The same artifact serves both audiences.\n\n### The output: flowing downstream\n\nRIF output is structured so that official platform plugins can consume it without parsing free-form prose. Fields map directly to issue tracker concepts:\n\n| RIF field | GitHub Issues | Jira |\n|-----------|--------------|------|\n| `title` | Issue title | Summary |\n| `type` | Issue type (Epic/Story) | Issue type |\n| `priority` | Projects v2 custom field | Priority field |\n| `size` | Projects v2 custom field | Story Points |\n| `labels` | Labels | Labels / Components |\n| `acceptance_criteria` | `- [ ]` checkboxes in body | Description section |\n| `dependencies` | Linked issues | Linked issues (blocks/blocked by) |\n| `parent` | Sub-issue parent | Epic Link |\n\n## A typical workflow\n\n1. **Consult the agent** before starting a new feature area. It checks the roadmap, flags sequencing issues, and confirms this is the right next thing to work on.\n\n2. **Run `/write-epic`** to scope the initiative. You get a structured spec with YAML metadata and a markdown body covering problem statement, success metrics, scope boundaries, and dependencies.\n\n3. **Run `/decompose-requirement`** on the epic to break it into stories. Each story gets its own YAML block with `parent` pointing back to the epic. The output includes a sequencing table showing dependencies and parallelization opportunities.\n\n4. **Run `/write-story`** on individual stories that need full specification. The skill runs INVEST validation and produces a complete story with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria duplicated in both the YAML metadata and the markdown body.\n\n5. **File with your platform plugin.** Pass the RIF output to the official GitHub or Atlassian Claude Code plugin to create issues, link them, and populate fields without copy-pasting or reformatting.\n\n6. **Close out completed work.** When you report back that work is done, the agent evaluates the reported outcomes against the story's acceptance criteria. If they are met, it says \"I believe this story is complete\" and asks for your confirmation. Once confirmed, it produces a closure summary with a suggested comment and any follow-up items. Pass that to the platform plugin to post the comment and close the issue.\n\n## When to use what\n\n| Situation | Use |\n|-----------|-----|\n| \"Should we build X now or later?\" | `product-owner` agent |\n| \"What's left in this phase?\" | `product-owner` agent |\n| \"We finished Y. What's next?\" | `product-owner` agent |\n| \"Scope out a new feature area\" | `/write-epic` |\n| \"Break this epic into stories\" | `/decompose-requirement` |\n| \"Break this story into subtasks\" | `/decompose-requirement` |\n| \"Write a proper story for this requirement\" | `/write-story` |\n\n## What this plugin does not do\n\n- Set product vision or decide what features to build\n- Make market-level trade-offs; those decisions belong to you\n- Call GitHub, Jira, or any external API to create, update, or close issues; those operations are delegated to the official github and atlassian Claude Code plugins\n- Directly manage board state or sprint assignments; when a story's acceptance criteria are met, the agent produces a closure summary and asks for your confirmation before you delegate the update to the platform plugin\n"
