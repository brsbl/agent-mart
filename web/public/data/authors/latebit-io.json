        "README.md": "# jean-claude-van-dev\n\nA full team of world-class Go staff engineers for Claude Code.\n\nBuilt on the principles of Pike, Cheney, Ryer, and Kennedy — simplicity, readability, and code that earns every line.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace (one-time)\nclaude plugin marketplace add latebit-io/jean-claude-van-dev\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install jean-claude-van-dev@jean-claude-van-dev\n```\n\nOr symlink into `~/.claude` for global use across all projects:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/latebit-io/jean-claude-van-dev.git ~/.jean-claude-van-dev\n~/.jean-claude-van-dev/install.sh\n```\n\nOr for local development:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/jean-claude-van-dev\n```\n\n## What You Get\n\n### Rules\n\nCore Go engineering principles applied to every interaction — error handling, interface design, package structure, concurrency, naming, testing, and performance. These shape how Claude writes Go code at all times.\n\n### Agents\n\nFive specialized engineering roles, invoked as subagents:\n\n| Agent | Role | Tools |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| `go-architect` | Package design, boundaries, dependency analysis, API surfaces | Read, Grep, Glob |\n| `go-reviewer` | Code review — idioms, error handling, concurrency, naming | Read, Grep, Glob |\n| `go-debugger` | Root cause analysis, race detection, profiling, stack traces | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash |\n| `go-tester` | Test strategy, coverage gaps, table-driven patterns, benchmarks | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash |\n| `go-refactorer` | Simplification, dead code removal, interface extraction | Read, Grep, Glob |\n\n### Skills\n\nSlash commands for common workflows:\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/jean-claude-van-dev:go-review` | Review changed Go files for idioms and anti-patterns |\n| `/jean-claude-van-dev:go-test` | Run tests with coverage analysis and gap identification |\n| `/jean-claude-van-dev:go-audit` | Audit error handling, goroutine patterns, and interface design |\n| `/jean-claude-van-dev:go-bench` | Run and analyze benchmarks with allocation profiling |\n\n### Hooks\n\nAutomatic quality enforcement on every `.go` file edit:\n\n- `gofmt` — auto-format on save\n- `go vet` — catch common mistakes immediately\n\n## Structure\n\n```\n.claude-plugin/\n  plugin.json            # Plugin manifest\n  marketplace.json       # Marketplace manifest\nagents/\n  go-architect.md        # System design advisor\n  go-reviewer.md         # Code review specialist\n  go-debugger.md         # Root cause analyst\n  go-tester.md           # Test strategy advisor\n  go-refactorer.md       # Simplification specialist\nskills/\n  go-review/SKILL.md     # Code review workflow\n  go-test/SKILL.md       # Test coverage workflow\n  go-audit/SKILL.md      # Codebase audit workflow\n  go-bench/SKILL.md      # Benchmark analysis workflow\nrules/\n  _root.md               # Go staff engineer principles\nhooks/\n  hooks.json             # gofmt + go vet on edit\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
