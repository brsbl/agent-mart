The terminology is fantasy-flavored, but the underlying principles--external goal, internal transformation, relationship dynamics--are universal.\n\n**Q: How long should my novel be?**\nA: Crucible Suite is optimized for epic fantasy (120,000-180,000 words). The 36 beats map to approximately 40-50 chapters at 3,000-4,000 words each.\n\n**Q: Can I modify the beat structure?**\nA: The planning documents you generate are fully editable. Adjust beat placement, merge beats, or split them as needed for your story.\n\n**Q: What if I already have a partial draft?**\nA: Use `/crucible-suite:crucible-continue` to detect your project state. You can generate planning documents retroactively or start outlining from any point.\n\n**Q: How do bi-chapter reviews work?**\nA: Every two chapters, the system automatically runs five review agents (voice, continuity, outline, timeline, prose) to catch issues early. You can also trigger reviews manually with `/crucible-suite:crucible-review`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| **Commands not recognized** | Ensure plugin is installed: check `~/.claude/plugins/crucible-suite/` exists |\n| **Python scripts fail** | Verify Python 3.8+ is installed and in PATH |\n| **Session state lost** | Run `/crucible-suite:crucible-restore` to recover from automatic backups |\n| **Review agents timeout** | Large chapters may need more time; break into smaller scenes |\n| **Planning seems stuck** | Use `/crucible-suite:crucible-status` to check progress, `/crucible-suite:crucible-continue` to resume |\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
