        "README.md": "# Oblique Skills\n\n![Oblique Skills](oblique-skills.png)\n\nA [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) - a deck of cards offering creative prompts to break through blocks and introduce unexpected directions.\n\nUse `/oblique-skills:oblique` to draw a strategy card and season your coding session with lateral thinking.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add jakedahn/oblique-skill\n/plugin install oblique-skills@jakedahn/oblique-skill\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/oblique-skills:oblique\n```\n\nThis presents you with 4 randomly-selected strategies. Pick one, then choose how to apply it:\n\n- **Apply to current task** - Focus the strategy on whatever you're working on right now\n- **Use as session mindset** - Let it color your entire session's approach\n- **Help me interpret it** - Get an explanation of what it might mean in a coding context\n\n## Example\n\n```\n> /oblique-skills:oblique\n\nWhich oblique strategy would you like to apply?\n  ○ Honor thy error as a hidden intention\n  ○ Emphasise the flaws\n  ○ Do nothing for as long as possible\n  ○ Use an old idea\n\n> Honor thy error as a hidden intention\n\nHow would you like to apply it?\n  ○ Apply to current task\n  ○ Use as session mindset\n  ○ Help me interpret it\n\n> Use as session mindset\n\n\"Honor thy error as a hidden intention\" is now seasoning this session.\n\nThat bug you found might actually be a feature in disguise. Instead of\nimmediately fixing, let's explore what the error is trying to tell us...\n```\n\n## The Strategies\n\nAll 113 original Oblique Strategies are included:\n\n> Do we need holes? • Emphasise differences • Honor thy error as a hidden intention • Trust in the you of now • Turn it upside down • Use an old idea • What wouldn't you do? • Faced with a choice, do both • Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities • Repetition is a form of change • *...and 103 more*\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\noblique-skill/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json\n├── commands/\n│   └── oblique.md          # /oblique command definition\n└── skills/\n    └── oblique/\n        ├── SKILL.md\n        └── scripts/\n            └── pick-strategies.sh   # Random selection (POSIX-compatible)\n```\n\nThe bash script uses a simple POSIX pipeline for cross-platform random selection:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' | awk 'BEGIN{srand()} {print rand(), $0}' | sort -n | head -n 4 | cut -d' ' -f2-\n```\n\nWorks identically on macOS and Linux.\n\n## Credits\n\n[Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) was created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1975. The original deck consists of cards with cryptic remarks intended to help artists break creative blocks.\n\nThis plugin adapts that concept for vibecoding - introducing lateral thinking prompts to help developers approach problems from unexpected angles.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "commands/oblique.md": "---\ndescription: Draw an oblique strategy card to season your coding session with lateral thinking\nallowed-tools: Bash, AskUserQuestion\n---\n\n# Oblique Strategy\n\nInspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies - creative prompts to break through blocks and introduce unexpected directions.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Run the script to get 4 random strategies:\n\n```bash\n${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/oblique/scripts/pick-strategies.sh -n 4\n```\n\n2. Present the strategies to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:\n   - header: \"Strategy\"\n   - question: \"Which oblique strategy would you like to apply?\"\n   - Each strategy as an option with a brief interpretation as description\n   - multiSelect: false\n\n3. After selection, ask how to apply via another `AskUserQuestion`:\n   - header: \"Application\"\n   - question: \"How would you like to apply '[selected strategy]'?\"\n   - Options:\n     - \"Apply to current task\" - Focus this strategy on whatever I'm working on right now\n     - \"Use as session mindset\" - Let this color the entire session's approach\n     - \"Help me interpret it\" - Explain what this might mean in a coding context\n\n4. Based on choice:\n   - **Apply to current task**: Reframe current work through the strategy's lens\n   - **Use as session mindset**: Acknowledge and reference naturally throughout\n   - **Help me interpret it**: Explain the strategy and offer coding interpretations\n",
        "skills/oblique/SKILL.md": "---\nname: oblique\ndescription: This skill should be used when the user asks to \"/oblique\", \"oblique strategy\", \"give me an oblique strategy\", \"give me a creative prompt\", or wants lateral thinking inspiration for their coding session.\nallowed-tools:\n  - Bash\n  - AskUserQuestion\n---\n\n# Oblique Strategies\n\nInspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies deck - a set of cards offering creative prompts to break through creative blocks and introduce unexpected directions.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Get Random Strategies\n\nRun the script to get 4 random strategies:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/pick-strategies.sh -n 4\n```\n\n### Step 2: Present Strategies to User\n\nUse `AskUserQuestion` to present the 4 strategies as options. Each strategy becomes a selectable option.\n\n**Format:**\n- header: \"Strategy\"\n- question: \"Which oblique strategy would you like to apply to this session?\"\n- options: The 4 strategies from the script output\n- multiSelect: false\n\n### Step 3: Ask How to Apply\n\nAfter the user selects a strategy, use another `AskUserQuestion` to ask how they'd like to apply it.\n\n**Format:**\n- header: \"Application\"\n- question: \"How would you like to apply '[selected strategy]'?\"\n- options:\n  - \"Apply to current task\" - Focus this strategy on whatever I'm working on right now\n  - \"Use as session mindset\" - Let this strategy color the entire session's approach\n  - \"Help me interpret it\" - Explain what this strategy might mean in a coding context\n- multiSelect: false\n\n### Step 4: Acknowledge and Incorporate\n\nBased on the user's choice:\n\n- **Apply to current task**: Reframe the current work through the lens of the strategy. Offer specific suggestions for how the strategy might change the approach.\n\n- **Use as session mindset**: Acknowledge the strategy and naturally reference it throughout the session when relevant. Let it influence suggestions and perspectives.\n\n- **Help me interpret it**: Explain the strategy's origin and meaning, then offer interpretations for how it might apply to software development, debugging, architecture, or creative coding challenges.\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n```\nUser: /oblique\n\nClaude: [Runs ./scripts/pick-strategies.sh -n 4]\n        Output:\n        - Honor thy error as a hidden intention\n        - Emphasise the flaws\n        - Do nothing for as long as possible\n        - Use an old idea\n\nClaude: [AskUserQuestion #1]\n        \"Which oblique strategy would you like to apply to this session?\"\n        Options presented to user...\n\nUser: Selects \"Honor thy error as a hidden intention\"\n\nClaude: [AskUserQuestion #2]\n        \"How would you like to apply 'Honor thy error as a hidden intention'?\"\n        Options presented to user...\n\nUser: Selects \"Apply to current task\"\n\nClaude: Interesting choice! \"Honor thy error as a hidden intention\" suggests that\n        mistakes aren't accidents - they might be revealing something your\n        conscious mind missed.\n\n        For your current work, this could mean:\n        - That bug you found might actually be a feature in disguise\n        - The \"wrong\" approach might lead somewhere interesting\n        - Instead of fixing, explore what the error is trying to tell you\n\n        What are you working on? Let's see what hidden intentions might be lurking.\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- The script uses POSIX tools (`awk`, `sort`, `head`, `cut`) for cross-platform compatibility\n- All 113 original Oblique Strategies are embedded in the script\n- Each invocation is independent - no state is tracked between uses\n"
