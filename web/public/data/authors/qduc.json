        "README.md": "# Advisor Skills for Claude Code\n\n**Empower Claude with a \"Council of Experts\" for better decision-making.**\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis plugin extends Claude Code's capabilities by giving it the ability to **consult specialized external models and agents**. Just as senior engineers seek second opinions or research documentation when stuck, this toolset allows Claude to:\n\n1.  **Break Tunnel Vision:** Use the **Strategist** agent to get an unbiased, high-level perspective on architectural decisions. By delegating complex reasoning to this specialized sub-agent (using the **Opus** model), you save costs by reserving high-intelligence processing only for critical strategic decisions while keeping your main session efficient.\n2.  **Verify & Research:** Use **Gemini** to fetch real-time documentation and libraries, preventing hallucinations about outdated APIs.\n3.  **Deepen Reasoning:** Use **Codex** to handle complex algorithmic logic and multi-step reasoning tasks that require a dedicated focus.\n\nInstead of relying on a single model's training data, this workflow enables a collaborative AI approach to problem-solving.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this collection to your Claude Code environment:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add qduc/advisor-skills\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n### Consult\n\n**Seek second opinions from specialized AI models and agents**\n\nThe Consult skill enables Claude to seek advice from various sources:\n- **Strategist Agent** - Unbiased, objective advice on complex strategic decisions and architectural trade-offs.\n- **Codex** - Deep reasoning for complex logical problems and multi-faceted analysis.\n- **Gemini** - Online research for current information, documentation, and real-world examples.\n\nUse when stuck on difficult problems, validating approaches, or needing fresh perspectives.\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\n/skill install consult\n```\n\n### Strategist Cooperation\n\n**Guidelines for effective collaboration with the Strategist agent**\n\nProvides patterns and best practices for working with the Strategist, including session continuity, preparing context, and handling advice.\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\n/skill install strategist-cooperation\n```\n\n## Agents\n\n### Strategist\n\n**Unbiased, objective advice on complex strategic decisions**\n\nA specialized agent that provides an outsider's perspective on difficult problems without being influenced by existing code, implementation details, or project constraints.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- Radical objectivity - evaluates everything purely on merit\n- Fresh perspective - unencumbered by technical debt or sunk costs\n- Strategic thinking - focuses on fundamental principles\n- Devil's advocate - challenges assumptions and explores alternatives\n\n**Use when:**\n- Stuck on architectural decisions and going in circles\n- Team debates with strong conflicting opinions\n- Need to cut through bias and see the situation with fresh eyes\n- Evaluating major refactoring or rewrite decisions\n\nThe agent applies first principles thinking, identifies hidden assumptions, and provides decision frameworks rather than prescriptive solutions.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nclaude-skills/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── marketplace.json\n│   └── plugin.json\n├── agents/\n│   └── strategist.md\n├── skills/\n│   ├── consult/\n│   │   └── SKILL.md\n│   └── strategist-cooperation/\n│       └── SKILL.md\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSkills in this collection are designed for personal productivity and AI-enhanced problem-solving workflows.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
