        "README.md": "# Deliberate Decisions\n\nA Claude Code plugin for making high-stakes decisions through systematic research and structured analysis.\n\n## Origin Story\n\nI discovered [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent while looking for ways to improve my AI-assisted coding workflow. After using it, I was impressed by how it enforced discipline— test-driven development (TDD), debugging workflows, code review patterns—through structured skills rather than ad-hoc prompting.\n\nI wanted to understand how it worked, so I forked it and walked through the architecture. The plugin system, the skill definitions, and the session hooks. I was expecting to find optimized prompts, but I found something much deeper - structure. \n\nThat exploration sparked an idea: what if I built something similar for decision-making? Not coding decisions, but the messy, high-stakes business decisions that keep founders up at night. Hiring. Strategy. Investment. The decisions where being wrong is expensive and the right answer isn't obvious.\n\nI built Deliberate Decisions as an experiment in applying the same structured, skill-based approach to decision-making that Superpowers applies to coding. It incorporates Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework, pre-mortem analysis, and reference class forecasting into a 7-gate process that forces slow, deliberate thinking. I was introduced to Kahneman in business school and I've found myself going back to his books time and time again (Thinking Fast & Slow).\n\nI'm sharing it in case others find it useful.\n\nThanks!\n\n-Matt\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Decisions fail in the small assumptions, not the big choices.**\n\nThis framework surfaces the hidden structure of decisions:\n- **Decision Points** - Individual choices and assumptions that influence outcome\n- **Decision Intersections** - How assumptions depend on or conflict with each other\n- **Facts vs Assumptions** - Rigorous separation of verifiable from speculative\n- **Must-Be-True Conditions** - What we're betting on\n\nBuilt on Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework, Deliberate Decisions enforces slow, deliberate thinking through mandatory gates.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/deliberate-decisions.git\n\n# Load as a Claude Code plugin\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/deliberate-decisions\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\n> /deliberate-decisions:decide\n\nI'm starting a new decision process using Deliberate Decisions.\n\nWhat decision are you facing?\n```\n\n## The Seven Gates\n\nEvery decision passes through seven mandatory gates:\n\n| Gate | Name | Purpose |\n|------|------|---------|\n| 1 | **Thesis** | Define what we're deciding and why |\n| 2 | **Landscape** | Map alternatives, Decision Points, Knowns/Unknowns |\n| 3 | **Research** | Gather evidence, find reference class |\n| 4 | **Calibration** | Separate Facts from Assumptions |\n| 5 | **Contrarian** | Pre-mortem, steel-man opposition, bias audit |\n| 6 | **Synthesis** | Must-Be-True Conditions, Exit Criteria, recommendation |\n| 7 | **Decision** | Human decides with full picture |\n\n## Decision Weight\n\nNot all decisions need the same rigor. Choose your depth:\n\n| Weight | Time | Best For |\n|--------|------|----------|\n| **Light** | <10 min | Reversible, domain expertise, lower stakes |\n| **Medium** | 30-40 min | Moderate stakes, some uncertainty |\n| **Complete** | 60-90 min | High stakes, irreversible, significant uncertainty |\n\n**Weight affects depth, not gates.** All 7 gates always run.\n\n```\n/deliberate-decisions:decide              # AI suggests weight after Thesis\n/deliberate-decisions:decide --light      # Start at Light\n/deliberate-decisions:decide --medium     # Start at Medium\n/deliberate-decisions:decide --complete   # Start at Complete\n```\n\nYou can upgrade mid-process. The AI will also suggest upgrading if complexity emerges.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| `/deliberate-decisions:decide` | Start a new decision |\n| `/deliberate-decisions:advocate` | Generate compelling case FOR |\n| `/deliberate-decisions:detract` | Generate compelling case AGAINST |\n| `/deliberate-decisions:review-decision` | Compare outcomes to predictions |\n| `/deliberate-decisions:resume-decision` | Continue a paused decision |\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **[Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md)** - Detailed walkthrough of each gate and command\n- **[Example Decision](docs/EXAMPLE.md)** - Real decision (founding AE hire) with full process\n- **[Example Artifact](docs/decisions/2026-01-27-founding-ae-hire/decision.md)** - Output from the example\n- **[Example Business Case](docs/decisions/2026-01-27-founding-ae-hire/advocacy/business-case.md)** - Advocacy output\n\n## Skills\n\n### Gate Skills\n- `thesis-framing` - Define decision, stakeholders, constraints\n- `landscape-mapping` - Map alternatives, Decision Points\n- `deep-research` - Web research, reference class\n- `calibration` - Separate Facts from Assumptions\n- `contrarian-analysis` - Pre-mortem, steel-man, bias audit\n- `synthesis` - Must-Be-True, Exit Criteria, recommendation\n- `decision-capture` - Document final decision\n\n### Supporting Skills\n- `using-deliberate-decisions` - Framework introduction\n- `bias-detection` - Cognitive bias library\n- `evidence-evaluation` - Source quality assessment\n- `decision-review` - Post-decision analysis\n- `decision-advocacy` - Build the case FOR\n- `decision-detraction` - Build the case AGAINST\n- `writing-style` - Longform and shortform writing principles\n\n## Output Structure\n\n```\ndocs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<decision-slug>/\n├── decision.md           # Full artifact\n├── research-notes.md     # Raw research findings\n├── calibration-log.md    # Facts vs Assumptions\n└── advocacy/\n    ├── business-case.md  # Case FOR\n    └── counter-case.md   # Case AGAINST\n```\n\n## When to Use This\n\n**Good fit:**\n- High-stakes decisions with a high cost of being wrong\n- When you want to challenge your assumptions & explore options\n- Ambiguous situations with multiple viable alternatives\n- Decisions where you suspect confirmation bias\n- Choices that deserve more rigor than intuition\n\n**Not a good fit:**\n- Easily reversible decisions\n- Time-critical situations requiring immediate action\n- Choices with obvious right answers\n- Decisions you've already made\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n**Superpowers** by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra) provided the architectural inspiration and plugin patterns for this project. If you're looking for AI-assisted coding workflows, check out [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).\n\nThe decision framework incorporates ideas from:\n- Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (System 1/System 2)\n- Gary Klein's pre-mortem technique\n- Philip Tetlock's reference class forecasting\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is an experiment.
