        "plugins/spec-driven-development/README.md": "# Spec-Driven Development Plugin\n\nA comprehensive development workflow plugin for Claude Code that follows a specification-first approach: **Clarify Requirements**, **Design Architecture**, **Create Plan**, and **Implement** with rigorous testing.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin enhances your development workflow with a structured approach:\n\n- **Requirements Definition**: Interactive Q&A or quick creation with review\n- **Design Specification**: Technical design and architecture based on requirements\n- **Implementation Planning**: UI-first planning for early visual feedback\n- **Plan Execution**: Systematic implementation with testing and phase-by-phase validation\n\n## Commands\n\nThe plugin provides six commands - choose between quick and thorough modes for requirements and design:\n\n### Quick Mode Commands\n\n#### `/sdd.create_requirements`\n\nCreates requirements document from brief description with review cycle.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Provide brief project description (1-3 paragraphs)\n2. AI generates complete `spec/requirements.md`\n3. Review and request adjustments as needed\n4. AI guides toward completion\n\n**Best for:** Experienced developers, clear vision, want to move fast\n\n**Output:** Complete requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria\n\n#### `/sdd.create_design`\n\nCreates design document with AI filling in tech stack gaps.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Provide tech preferences (specific like \"React, TypeScript\" or \"you decide\")\n2. AI fills gaps and generates `spec/design.md`\n3. AI explicitly states decisions made\n4. Review and request adjustments as needed\n5. AI guides toward completion\n\n**Best for:** Know your tech stack or trust AI decisions, want to move fast\n\n**Output:** Comprehensive design document with tech stack and architecture\n\n### Thorough Mode Commands\n\n#### `/sdd.clarify_requirements`\n\nHelps clarify project requirements by asking focused questions and documenting user needs.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Describe what you want to build\n2. Answer clarifying questions about user needs, goals, use cases, and edge cases\n3. Generates `spec/requirements.md` with user stories and acceptance criteria\n\n**Best for:** Complex projects, want guided exploration, prefer answering questions\n\n**Output:** Complete requirements document with user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria\n\n#### `/sdd.clarify_design`\n\nClarifies technical design and architecture based on requirements.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Reads your requirements from `spec/requirements.md`\n2. Asks about tech stack, architecture patterns, data storage, UI approach, and testing preferences\n3. Generates `spec/design.md` with complete technical specifications\n\n**Best for:** Want to think through architecture decisions, unfamiliar with options\n\n**Output:** Comprehensive design document with tech stack, component breakdown, data models, and testing strategy\n\n### Shared Commands\n\n#### `/sdd.create_plan`\n\nCreates detailed implementation plan based on requirements and design specifications.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Reads `spec/requirements.md` and `spec/design.md`\n2. Auto-detects if project has UI and uses UI-first planning approach\n3. Generates `spec/plan.md` with 3-5 phases of concrete tasks\n4. Each task includes file paths, test requirements, verification steps, and success criteria\n\n**Output:** Detailed implementation plan ready for execution (UI-first when applicable)\n\n#### `/sdd.implement_plan`\n\nImplements the project based on the approved implementation plan with rigorous testing.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Reads all spec documents (`plan.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`)\n2. For each task:\n   - Implement the code\n   - Write tests\n   - Run tests (max 3 attempts)\n   - Manual verification if required\n   - Update checkboxes in plan.md\n3. Stops at end of each phase for human review\n\n**Output:** Working implementation with all tests passing and checkboxes marked in plan.md\n\n## Usage\n\n### Choosing Your Workflow\n\n**Quick Workflow (Create Mode)**\n- You have a clear vision of what to build\n- Experienced with your tech stack\n- Want to move fast with one or two review rounds\n- Trust AI to make reasonable assumptions\n\n**Thorough Workflow (Clarify Mode)**\n- Complex or unfamiliar project\n- Want AI to guide you through considerations\n- Prefer answering questions over reviewing assumptions\n- Learning or exploring the problem space\n\nBoth workflows produce the same spec documents and lead to the same planning and implementation.\n\n### Quick Workflow Example\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create requirements from brief description\n/sdd.create_requirements\n> \"Build a personal task manager with tags and due dates...\"\n> [AI generates requirements.md] → Review → Adjust if needed\n\n# 2. Create design with tech preferences\n/sdd.create_design\n> \"React, TypeScript, local storage\"\n> [AI fills gaps, generates design.md] → Review → Adjust if needed\n\n# 3. Generate implementation plan (UI-first when applicable)\n/sdd.create_plan\n\n# 4. Build it\n/sdd.implement_plan\n```\n\n### Thorough Workflow Example\n\n```bash\n# 1. Interactive requirements clarification\n/sdd.clarify_requirements\n> [Answer 5-10 questions about needs, goals, edge cases]\n\n# 2. Interactive design clarification\n/sdd.clarify_design\n> [Answer questions about tech stack, architecture, testing]\n\n# 3. Generate implementation plan (UI-first when applicable)\n/sdd.create_plan\n\n# 4. Build it\n/sdd.implement_plan\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n#### Documentation-First Philosophy\n\nAll commands follow a specification-first approach:\n- Requirements drive design\n- Design drives planning\n- Plan drives implementation\n- Every decision is documented and traceable\n\n#### Early UI Visibility (UI-First Planning)\n\nWhen your project has a user interface, plans automatically use UI-first approach:\n- Phase 1: Project setup + basic UI shell\n- Phase 2: Complete UI with mock/hardcoded data (fully interactive)\n- Phase 3: Backend and data layer\n- Phase 4: Integration (replace mocks with real data)\n- Phase 5: Polish and testing\n\n**Why UI-First?**\n- See and interact with UI early (Phase 2) before investing in backend complexity\n- Catch design misalignments when they're easy to fix\n- Validate direction with working prototype using fake data\n- UI with mocks is cheap to change; backend with real data is expensive to change\n- Maintains momentum with tangible, visual progress\n\nFor projects without UI (APIs, CLIs, libraries), plans use appropriate structure.\n\n#### Rigorous Testing\n\nImplementation includes mandatory testing:\n- Every task must have test requirements\n- Tests must pass before moving to next task\n- Max 3 test attempts before stopping for guidance\n- Manual verification for UI/UX concerns\n\n#### Phase-Based Execution\n\nImplementation proceeds phase-by-phase:\n- Each phase has clear boundaries\n- Stop at end of each phase for human review\n- Update checkboxes as tasks complete\n- Never skip ahead without approval\n\n#### Clear Verification\n\nEvery task includes:\n- Specific verification steps\n- Success criteria\n- Test commands to run\n- Manual checks if needed\n\n## File Structure\n\nThe plugin creates a `spec/` directory with three documents:\n\n```\nspec/\n├── requirements.md  (from /sdd.create_requirements or /sdd.clarify_requirements)\n├── design.md        (from /sdd.create_design or /sdd.clarify_design)\n└── plan.md          (from /sdd.create_plan, updated by /sdd.implement_plan)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Choose the Right Mode**: Use quick mode when you have a clear vision, thorough mode when exploring\n2. **Don't Skip Steps**: Follow the workflow in order - each command builds on the previous\n3. **Review Specs**: Check each spec document before moving to the next phase (adjust as needed)\n4. **Trust UI-First**: For UI projects, seeing the interface with mock data first validates direction early\n5. **Test Continuously**: Verify each task before proceeding\n6. **Stop Between Phases**: Human review prevents mistakes and scope creep\n\n## When to Use\n\nThis plugin is ideal for:\n- Starting new projects or features from scratch\n- Projects with clear or explorable scope\n- When you want to see UI early (mock data before backend)\n- Teams that value documentation\n- Both quick iteration and thorough exploration\n- Projects requiring rigorous testing\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code installed\n- Basic understanding of software development concepts\n- Clear project idea (for quick mode) or willingness to explore (for thorough mode)\n\n## Philosophy\n\nSpec-Driven Development emphasizes:\n- **Clarity before code**: Understand requirements before designing\n- **Design before implementation**: Plan architecture before coding\n- **UI before backend**: When applicable, validate UI with mocks before building expensive backend\n- **Testing as verification**: Every task must be verified\n- **Phase-by-phase progress**: Stop for review, prevent mistakes\n- **Documentation as communication**: Specs are the source of truth\n- **Flexibility in approach**: Choose quick or thorough based on your needs\n",
        "plugins/research-plan-implement/README.md": "# Research-Plan-Implement Plugin\n\nA comprehensive development workflow plugin for Claude Code that follows a three-phase approach: **Research** your codebase, **Plan** your implementation, and **Implement** with verification.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis plugin is based on advanced context engineering methodologies developed by [Dexter Horthy](https://github.com/humanlayer) at HumanLayer. The original prompts and workflow patterns are adapted from the [Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md) framework.\n\n**Credits:**\n- Original methodology: Dexter Horthy @ HumanLayer\n- Adaptation & plugin packaging: Kasper Junge\n- Further reading: [ACE for Coding Agents Blog Post](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin enhances your development workflow with:\n\n- **Specialized Research Agents**: Deep codebase analysis, pattern finding, and web research\n- **Interactive Planning**: Research-driven implementation planning with parallel sub-agents\n- **Structured Execution**: Phase-by-phase implementation with automated and manual verification\n\n## Agents\n\n### Codebase Research Agents\n\n- **`codebase-analyzer`**: Analyzes implementation details, traces data flow, and documents technical workings with precise file:line references\n- **`codebase-locator`**: Finds files, directories, and components relevant to features or tasks\n- **`codebase-pattern-finder`**: Discovers similar implementations and existing patterns to model after\n- **`web-search-researcher`**: Performs web research for documentation, best practices, and technical solutions\n\n## Commands\n\nThe plugin provides three core commands that map to the Research → Plan → Implement workflow:\n\n- **`/humanlayer.research_codebase`**: Comprehensive codebase research using parallel sub-agents\n- **`/humanlayer.create_plan`**: Interactive implementation planning with codebase research\n- **`/humanlayer.implement_plan`**: Executes approved plans with verification and testing\n\n## Usage\n\n### Research Workflow\n\n1. Start with codebase research:\n   ```\n   /humanlayer.research_codebase\n   ```\n   Answer the prompt with your research question\n\n2.

The six principles work together to create word-of-mouth:\n\n1. **Social Currency**: People share things that make them look good, knowledgeable, or \"in-the-know\"\n2. **Triggers**: Frequent environmental cues that prompt discussion\n3. **Emotion**: High-arousal emotions (awe, excitement, anger) drive sharing more than low-arousal ones\n4. **Public**: Observable things get imitated - \"built to show, built to grow\"\n5. **Practical Value**: Useful information that helps others gets shared readily\n6. **Stories**: Information travels when woven into compelling narratives\n\nThe most contagious ideas typically leverage multiple principles simultaneously.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v1.0.0 or higher\n- This is a skill plugin, so Claude will automatically use it when relevant to your conversation\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\nKasper Junge\n",
        "plugins/opportunity-solution-tree/README.md": "# Opportunity Solution Tree Plugin\n\nA Claude Code plugin that helps pre-PMF startups navigate product discovery using the Opportunity Solution Tree framework. Avoid building something nobody wants by systematically exploring the problem space before committing to solutions.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin provides an AI agent skill that guides you through creating and maintaining an Opportunity Solution Tree - a living document that maps:\n\n1. **Outcome**: What you're trying to learn or achieve (your learning goal)\n2. **Opportunities**: Real problems your target customers experience\n3. **Solutions**: Multiple ways you might address each opportunity\n4. **Experiments**: Specific tests to validate your assumptions\n\nThe skill helps you avoid common pitfalls like jumping to solutions too quickly, confusing features with problems, or building before validating.\n\n## When to Use This Plugin\n\nUse this plugin when you need help with:\n\n- Product discovery and validation for pre-PMF startups\n- Identifying which problems are worth solving\n- Structuring customer research findings\n- Mapping opportunities before building solutions\n- Designing experiments to test assumptions\n- Understanding the Opportunity Solution Tree framework\n- Avoiding \"build it and they will come\" mistakes\n- Finding product-market fit systematically\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe skill guides you through the four levels of the OST:\n\n### 1. Outcome (The Root)\nNot a polished KPI, but a learning goal or early traction signal:\n- \"Validate that [ICP] will pay for a solution to [problem]\"\n- \"Get 10 companies actively using our prototype weekly\"\n- \"Find the problem worth building a company around in [market]\"\n\n### 2. Opportunities (First Branches)\nReal customer problems from conversations and research:\n- Framed from the customer's perspective\n- Solution-agnostic\n- Have real consequences (pass the \"so what?\" test)\n- Right level of altitude (not too generic, not too specific)\n\n### 3. Solutions (Next Layer)\nMultiple specific ideas per opportunity:\n- Range from lightweight to built-out\n- Include non-scalable/manual options\n- Clearly connect to the opportunity\n- Diverse in approach (software, services, templates, etc.)\n\n### 4. Experiments (The Leaves)\nTime-bound tests with clear hypotheses:\n- \"We believe [solution] will [result] for [opportunity]\"\n- \"We'll know we're right when [measurable outcome]\"\n- Completable in days or weeks, not months\n- Test specific assumptions before building\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```\nYou: I'm building a tool for small e-commerce brands. How do I validate what to build?\n\nClaude: [Activates opportunity-solution-tree skill]\n\nLet me help you use the Opportunity Solution Tree framework to explore the problem space systematically.\n\nFirst, let's clarify your outcome. At the pre-PMF stage, this should be a learning goal. For example:\n- \"Validate that small e-commerce brands will pay for [specific problem solution]\"\n- \"Identify which segment within small e-commerce has the most urgent need\"\n- \"Get 10 brands actively using our prototype weekly\"\n\nWhat are you trying to learn or validate?\n\n[... guided discovery process follows ...]\n```\n\nThe skill automatically activates when you ask about:\n- Product discovery or validation\n- Opportunity Solution Trees\n- What to build next (pre-PMF context)\n- Customer research and problem validation\n- Running experiments to test assumptions\n\n## Common Pitfalls Avoided\n\nThe skill helps you avoid these mistakes:\n\n- **Solution disguised as outcome**: Smuggling your solution into the outcome position\n- **Feature-opportunities**: Listing features you want to build instead of customer problems\n- **Tunnel vision**: Only exploring 1-2 opportunities that match your preconceived solution\n- **Armchair research**: Filling the tree based on assumptions instead of customer conversations\n- **Equal weighting**: Treating all opportunities as equally important\n- **Too big to test**: Only considering solutions that take months to build\n- **Vague experiments**: \"Get feedback\" instead of specific hypotheses with success criteria\n- **Static tree**: Creating once and never updating\n\n## Skills Included\n\n### `opportunity-solution-tree`\n\nAn autonomous agent skill that provides expert guidance on creating and maintaining OSTs for pre-PMF startups. Claude will automatically invoke this skill when relevant to your query.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is part of the 30 Minute Vibe Coding Challenge marketplace.\n\nTo install:\n```\n/plugin install opportunity-solution-tree@30-minute-vibe-coding-challenge\n```\n\n## About the Framework\n\nThe Opportunity Solution Tree is a continuous discovery framework that helps startups:\n\n- **Separate learning from building**: Most early effort should be understanding opportunities, not creating solutions\n- **Stay problem-focused**: The problem is usually more stable than your solution pre-PMF\n- **Embrace multiple options**: You don't know which problem is most valuable yet\n- **Make learning explicit**: Articulate what you're testing and what would change your mind\n\nThe tree is a living document that evolves as you learn from experiments and customer conversations. It's about being honest about what you know, what you're guessing, and what you need to learn next.\n\n## Pre-PMF Mindset\n\nThis framework is specifically designed for pre-PMF startups because it:\n\n- Resists the urge to build immediately\n- Forces you to articulate assumptions before testing them\n- Keeps multiple opportunities in play until validated\n- Makes it safe to invalidate ideas early (before building)\n- Creates a systematic path from uncertainty to product-market fit\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v1.0.0 or higher\n- This is a skill plugin, so Claude will automatically use it when relevant to your conversation\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\nKasper Junge\n"
