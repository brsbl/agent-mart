Specwright optimises for <i>works</i>.</b>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n## Why Specwright?\n\nAI agents optimise for \"done.\" That's the problem. Code compiles, tests pass, CI is green — and three days later you find an export nobody imports, a handler that's never called, a validation rule that exists in the spec but not in the code. **The hard part isn't writing code. It's proving it works.**\n\nSpecwright closes the **entire loop** — design, plan, build, verify, ship, learn. Every requirement is tracked to implementation evidence. Every PR ships with proof, not promises.\n\n### Without Specwright\n\n- AI optimises for \"task done\" not \"feature works\"\n- Fast delivery of broken, unwired code\n- Tests pass but features aren't connected\n- Context loss during long sessions causes drift\n- No evidence trail for what was verified\n- Every project re-invents the same workflow\n\n### With Specwright\n\n- Specs before implementation, always\n- Wiring verification catches orphaned code and broken connections\n- Evidence-based PRs with gate proof for every acceptance criterion\n- Compaction recovery reloads full context automatically\n- Learning system captures failures and promotes patterns across sessions\n- Codebase knowledge persists across sessions — no re-discovering the same architecture\n- Periodic health checks find systemic debt that per-change gates miss\n- One install, configure once, works with any language or framework\n\n### How It Compares\n\n| Capability | Specwright | [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) | [Oh-My-ClaudeCode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) | [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Manual workflows |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Structured spec writing | Yes | **Yes** — core strength | Yes | Yes | DIY |\n| Adversarial TDD (separate tester/executor) | **Yes** | No | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Wiring verification (orphaned code, layer violations) | **Yes** | No | No | No | No |\n| Evidence-based PRs (criterion → code + test) | **Yes** | No | No | No | No |\n| Quality gates with findings (not just badges) | **Yes** | Partial | Yes | Partial | DIY |\n| Compaction recovery | **Yes** | No | Yes | No | No |\n| Learning system (patterns promoted across sessions) | **Yes** | No | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Codebase knowledge persistence | **Yes** | No | Yes | No | No |\n\nEvery tool in this space pushes AI-assisted development forward. Specwright's focus is the **verification and evidence gap** — the part between \"tests pass\" and \"it actually works.\"\n\n## What Makes This Different\n\nOther tools in this space tend to focus on the **front half** of the loop — specification authoring, agent orchestration, or planning scaffolds — then hand off to the AI. The hard part isn't planning or delegation. It's everything after: does the code actually do what was asked? Is it wired up? Is it secure? Can you prove it?\n\nSpecwright focuses on the **verification and evidence** side — the part where AI agents actually fail.\n\n**Evidence Pipeline** — Five sequential gates capture proof into structured reports. PRs ship with a compliance matrix mapping every acceptance criterion to code and test evidence. Reviewers don't have to trust — they can verify.\n\n**Wiring Verification** — Static analysis catches orphaned files, unused exports, layer violations, and circular dependencies. Other tools check if code compiles and tests pass. Specwright checks if the code is actually connected.\n\n**Learning System** — Failures are captured, patterns are promoted, and learnings compact into tiered memory (index, themes, raw data). The system gets smarter with every session. Knowledge survives context windows.\n\n**Codebase Knowledge** — During init, Specwright surveys your codebase and builds a persistent knowledge document (`LANDSCAPE.md`) covering architecture, modules, conventions, and gotchas. Design phases load this instantly instead of re-scanning. It stays current — refreshed when stale, incrementally updated after every shipped work unit.\n\n**Codebase Health Checks** — Run `/sw-audit` periodically to find systemic issues that per-change gates miss: architecture debt, complexity growth, convention drift, accumulated workarounds. Findings persist in `AUDIT.md` with stable IDs across re-runs. Design phases surface relevant findings. The learn phase resolves them when addressed.\n\n**Compaction Recovery** — All stateful skills support resume-from-crash. When Claude's context window compacts, Specwright reloads full state from disk — including workflow stage, work unit queue, and gate progress — so no manual re-orientation is needed.\n\n## How It Works\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"/sw-init\"] --> B[\"/sw-design\"]\n    B --> C[\"/sw-plan\"]\n    C --> D[\"/sw-build\"]\n    D --> E[\"/sw-verify\"]\n    E --> F[\"/sw-ship\"]\n    F -.->|next work unit| D\n    F --> G[\"/sw-learn\"]\n    G -.->|patterns feed back| B\n    H[\"/sw-audit\"] -.->|findings feed into| B\n\n    style A fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style B fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style C fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style D fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style E fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style F fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style G fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n    style H fill:#1e293b,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#f8fafc\n```\n\n| Phase | What Happens | Key Innovation |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Init** | Detect stack, configure gates, create anchor documents | Auto-detection — don't ask what you can infer |\n| **Design** | Triage as Full / Lite / Quick, research codebase, design solution, adversarial critic | Right-sized ceremony — trivial fixes skip the full cycle |\n| **Plan** | Decompose into work units, write testable acceptance criteria | Specs grounded in approved design artifacts |\n| **Build** | TDD — tester writes hard-to-pass tests, executor makes them pass | Adversarial test-first, not test-after |\n| **Verify** | 5 quality gates with evidence capture | Findings shown inline, not just pass/fail badges |\n| **Ship** | PR with acceptance criteria mapped to evidence | Every requirement traceable to code + test |\n| **Learn** | Capture patterns, promote to constitution | Knowledge compounds across sessions |\n| **Audit** | Periodic health check — architecture, complexity, consistency, debt | Finds systemic issues gates miss. Run anytime. |\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall the plugin:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add Obsidian-Owl/specwright\n/plugin install specwright@specwright\n```\n\nInitialize your project:\n```\n/sw-init\n```\n\nOptionally, set up automated guardrails (linters, hooks, CI checks):\n```\n/sw-guard\n```\n\nThen design, plan, and iterate per work unit:\n```\n/sw-design add-user-authentication\n/sw-plan\n\n# for each work unit:\n/sw-build\n/sw-verify\n/sw-ship\n```\n\n## Codebase Knowledge and Health\n\nTwo optional features keep Specwright informed about your codebase across sessions:\n\n**Landscape** (`LANDSCAPE.md`) — A persistent map of your codebase's architecture, modules, conventions, and integration points. Created automatically during `/sw-init` if you opt in. The design phase loads it for instant context instead of re-scanning every time. Updated incrementally after each shipped work unit.\n\n- Created by: `/sw-init` (survey phase, optional)\n- Consumed by: `/sw-design` (auto-refreshed when stale)\n- Updated by: `/sw-learn` (after shipping)\n\n**Audit** (`AUDIT.md`) — A persistent record of systemic codebase health issues. Run `/sw-audit` when you want a health check — it's not part of the regular workflow, so use it whenever it makes sense: before starting a large feature, after a refactoring sprint, or on a regular cadence.\n\n```\n/sw-audit              # auto-triage: standard or full based on codebase size\n/sw-audit src/api/     # focused: analyze only the specified path\n/sw-audit --full       # full: parallel analysis across all dimensions\n```\n\nFindings persist across runs with stable IDs. When you design new work, relevant findings are surfaced automatically. When you ship work that addresses a finding, the learn phase marks it resolved.\n\n- Created by: `/sw-audit` (run anytime)\n- Consumed by: `/sw-design` (surfaces relevant findings during research)\n- Resolved by: `/sw-learn` (marks addressed findings as resolved)\n\n## Six Specialized Agents\n\nSpecwright delegates to purpose-built agents — each with a distinct role, model, and adversarial stance:\n\n| Agent | Model | Role | Mindset |\n|-------|-------|------|---------|\n| **Architect** | Opus | Design review, critic, structural analysis | *\"What did you miss? What will break?\"* |\n| **Tester** | Opus | Write tests designed to be hard to pass | *\"How can I prove this is wrong?\"* |\n| **Executor** | Sonnet | Make the tests pass. Minimal code, maximum correctness. | *\"What's the simplest thing that works?\"* |\n| **Reviewer** | Opus | Spec compliance verification | *\"Show me the evidence.\"* |\n| **Build Fixer** | Sonnet | Fix build/test failures with minimal diffs | *\"Get green, don't refactor.\"* |\n| **Researcher** | Sonnet | External documentation and API lookup | *\"What does the official doc say?\"* |\n\n## Five Quality Gates\n\nEvery work unit passes through configurable gates before shipping. **Default stance: FAIL.** Evidence must prove PASS.\n\n| Gate | Checks | Severity |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| **Build** | Compilation + test suite pass | BLOCK |\n| **Tests** | Assertion strength, boundary coverage, mock discipline | BLOCK/WARN |\n| **Security** | Leaked secrets, injection patterns, sensitive data | BLOCK |\n| **Wiring** | Orphaned files, unused exports, layer violations, circular deps | WARN |\n| **Spec** | Every acceptance criterion mapped to code + test evidence | BLOCK |\n\n## Persistent Documents\n\nTwo **anchor documents** drive all decisions and survive context compaction:\n\n**`CONSTITUTION.md`** — Development practices the AI must follow. Testing standards, coding conventions, security requirements. Not suggestions — rules.\n\n**`CHARTER.md`** — Technology vision and architectural invariants. What this project is, who consumes it, what doesn't change.\n\nTwo optional **reference documents** accelerate research and track health:\n\n**`LANDSCAPE.md`** — Codebase knowledge: architecture, modules, conventions, gotchas. Loaded on demand, never blocks workflow.\n\n**`AUDIT.md`** — Codebase health findings: systemic debt, complexity growth, convention drift. Loaded on demand, findings have stable IDs.\n\n## Skills\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n\n**Core Workflow**\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/sw-init` | Project setup, constitution, charter |\n| `/sw-design` | Research, design, adversarial critic |\n| `/sw-plan` | Decompose, spec, acceptance criteria |\n| `/sw-build` | TDD implementation |\n| `/sw-verify` | Quality gates |\n| `/sw-ship` | PR with evidence |\n\n</td><td>\n\n**Utilities**\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/sw-guard` | Configure guardrails (hooks, CI) |\n| `/sw-status` | Progress and state |\n| `/sw-learn` | Pattern capture |\n| `/sw-audit` | Codebase health check |\n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Configuration</b></summary>\n\nSpecwright reads project configuration from `.specwright/config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"project\": { \"name\": \"...\", \"languages\": [...] },\n  \"commands\": { \"build\": \"...\", \"test\": \"...\", \"lint\": \"...\" },\n  \"gates\": { \"enabled\": [\"build\", \"tests\", \"wiring\", \"security\", \"spec\"] }\n}\n```\n\nAll configuration is project-specific.
