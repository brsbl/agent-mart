        "README.md": "# houston-plugins\n\nVersion 1.0.0-beta.2\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins containing core commands, agents, skills, and tools for automated agentic project work.\n\n## What it does\n\nHouston Plugins provides a Claude Code plugin marketplace with skill-based extensions for agentic coding workflows. Skills are self-contained markdown files that extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Claude Code** (requires Pro or higher subscription) — see [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install the Marketplace\n2. Install the Plugin\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\n**Step 1** - Install Marketplace\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add thinkbuildship/houston-plugins\n```\n\n**Step 2** - Install Plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin install houston@houston-plugins\n```\n\nSelect deployment scope: *Install for you (user scope)* (Recommended) \n\n\n**Step 3** - Restart Claude Code\n\n## Usage\n\nClaude Code should automatically recognize the houston plugin and skill(s). Give it a try:\n\n```\n/update-documentation @README.md\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Skills utilize a namespace mechanism to help prevent issues with similarly named plugins e.g. `/<plugin>:<skill-name>` \n\n### Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Command | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| Update Documentation | `/update-documentation` | Compares your documentation against the actual codebase and updates it to match the implementation |\n| Visualize Code | `/visualize-code` | Generates an interactive HTML codebase visualization with tree and treemap views, git hotspot analysis, and line counts |\n| Workflow | `/workflow` | Assists with ideation, planning, design, implementation, testing, and hardening using a phased agentic development lifecycle |\n\nMore skills are planned — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).\n\n\n## Alternative Installations\n\n\n### Step 1 - Install Marketplace\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You do NOT need to clone the repo to install the marketplace or plugins!\n\n#### Install from GitHub (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add thinkbuildship/houston-plugins\n```\n\n#### Install via the Interactive Menu\n\n1. Launch `claude` in your project directory\n2. `/plugin` — Manage Claude Code plugins\n3. Navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab\n4. Press Enter to Add Marketplace\n5. Paste in `git@github.com:thinkbuildship/houston-plugins.git`, press Enter\n\n#### Install from a Local Clone\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:thinkbuildship/houston-plugins.git\n```\n\nThen in Claude Code:\n\n1. `/plugin` — Manage Claude Code plugins\n2. Navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab\n3. Press Enter to Add Marketplace\n4. Type in the path to your cloned `houston-plugins` repo (root), press Enter\n\nAfter successfully configuring the Marketplace, Claude Code should switch to the **Discover** tab.\n\n### Step 2 - Install Plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin install houston@houston-plugins\n```\nOR \n\nAlternatively, this gets you to the same place\n1. Switch to the **Marketplaces** tab, select `houston-plugins`\n2. Select `Browse plugins`\n3. Select `○ houston`\n4. Choose deployment scope:\n   - **Install for you** (`user scope`) — for all projects on your computer (Recommended)\n   - **Install for all collaborators** (`project scope`) — for the current project, version controlled\n   - **Install for you, in this repo only** (`local scope`) — for the current project, but gitignored\n5. Restart Claude Code\n\n\n### Update Plugin or Marketplace\n\nUse `/plugin` to Update, Manage, or Remove the Plugin (or full Marketplace).\n\n## Local Development\n\nFor contributors or anyone working on the plugins locally, there is an install script that symlinks the plugin into `~/.claude/plugins/` so changes are picked up immediately without version bumps.\n\nRequires **uv** (Python 3.8+).\n\n```bash\n# Read config only (no changes)\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py\n\n# Register marketplace locally for testing\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --install\n\n# Preview what install would do\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --install --dry-run\n\n# Remove marketplace from local Claude Code\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --uninstall\n```\n\nMust be run from the repo root.\n\n## Releases\n\nSee [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nPlease share bugs or feedback. This is a side project, I will do my best to respond and address.\n\nLog a Question, Feature Request, or Bug here: [Issues](https://github.com/thinkbuildship/houston-plugins/issues)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nPlanned skills include structured workflow, PRD toolkit, GitHub issue work tracking, and agentic loop development. Many features are under active development and will be added in upcoming releases.\n\nTrack progress and request features here: [Issues](https://github.com/thinkbuildship/houston-plugins/issues)\n\n## Safeguards\n\nAgentic development is awesome, but it comes with additional risks and considerations. The plugins and utilities provided in this code base come without warranty. Use at your own risk. Source code is provided for transparency and review.\n\n### Tips for safe coding\n\n- Backup your code\n- Configure just-enough permissions that matches your risk tolerance\n- Use [Plan Mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis)\n- Leverage [Checkpoints and Permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#stay-safe-with-checkpoints-and-permissions)\n\nHappy coding."
