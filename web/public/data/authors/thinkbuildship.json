        "README.md": "# houston-plugins\n\nVersion 1.0.0-beta.1\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins containing core commands, agents, skills, and tools for automated agentic project work.\n\n## What it does\n\nHouston Plugins provides a Claude Code plugin marketplace with skill-based extensions for agentic coding workflows. Skills are self-contained markdown files that extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities.\n\n### Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Command | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| Update Documentation | `/update-documentation` | Compares your documentation against the actual codebase and updates it to match the implementation |\n\nMore skills are planned — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Claude Code** (requires Pro or higher subscription) — see [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install the Marketplace\n2. Install the Plugin\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\n### Step 1 - Install Marketplace\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You do NOT need to clone the repo to install the marketplace or plugins!\n\n#### Install from GitHub (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add thinkbuildship/houston-plugins\n```\n\nOR use the interactive menu:\n\n1. Launch `claude` in your project directory\n2. `/plugin` — Manage Claude Code plugins\n3. Navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab\n4. Press Enter to Add Marketplace\n5. Paste in `git@github.com:thinkbuildship/houston-plugins.git`, press Enter\n\n#### Install from a Local Clone\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:thinkbuildship/houston-plugins.git\n```\n\nThen in Claude Code:\n\n1. `/plugin` — Manage Claude Code plugins\n2. Navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab\n3. Press Enter to Add Marketplace\n4. Type in the path to your cloned `houston-plugins` repo (root), press Enter\n\nAfter successfully configuring the Marketplace, Claude Code should switch to the **Discover** tab.\n\n### Step 2 - Install Plugin\n\n1. On the **Discover** tab, you should see:\n\n   `houston • houston-plugins • 0 installs`\n\n2. Press Enter to select the `houston` plugin\n3. Choose deployment scope:\n   - `user scope` — for all projects on your computer (Recommended)\n   - `project scope` — for the current project, version controlled\n   - `local scope` — for the current project, but gitignored\n4. Press Enter\n5. Restart Claude Code\n\nClaude Code should now recognize the houston plugin. Give it a try:\n\n```\n/update-documentation @README.md\n```\n\n### Update Plugin or Marketplace\n\nUse `/plugin` to Update, Manage, or Remove the Plugin (or full Marketplace).\n\n## Local Development\n\nFor contributors or anyone working on the plugins locally, there is an install script that symlinks the plugin into `~/.claude/plugins/` so changes are picked up immediately without version bumps.\n\nRequires **uv** (Python 3.8+).\n\n```bash\n# Read config only (no changes)\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py\n\n# Register marketplace locally for testing\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --install\n\n# Preview what install would do\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --install --dry-run\n\n# Remove marketplace from local Claude Code\nuv run scripts/install_marketplace.py --uninstall\n```\n\nMust be run from the repo root.\n\n## Releases\n\nSee [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nI would love if you share bugs or feedback. This is a side project, but I will do my best to respond and address.\n\nLog a Question, Feature Request, or Bug here: [Issues](https://github.com/thinkbuildship/houston-plugins/issues)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nPlanned skills include structured workflow, PRD toolkit, GitHub issue work tracking, and agentic loop development. Many features are under active development and will be added in upcoming releases.\n\nTrack progress and request features here: [Issues](https://github.com/thinkbuildship/houston-plugins/issues)\n\n## Safeguards\n\nAgentic development is awesome, but it comes with additional risks and considerations. The plugins and utilities provided in this code base come without warranty. Use at your own risk. Source code is provided for transparency and review.\n\n### Tips for safe coding\n\n- Backup your code\n- Configure just-enough permissions that matches your risk tolerance\n- Use [Plan Mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis)\n- Leverage [Checkpoints and Permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#stay-safe-with-checkpoints-and-permissions)\n\nHappy coding."
