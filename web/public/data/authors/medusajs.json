Start Claude:\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\n2. Add the Medusa marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills\n```\n\n3. Install any of the plugins.

Copy the skills directories to the .cursor/skills directory of your Medusa project.\n2. Add the MCP server configuration to the .cursor/mcp.json file of your Medusa project.\n\n## Usage\n\nThese plugins will help you with your Medusa development. Refer to each plugin for more details on usage.\n\n## Privacy\n\nThe Medusa plugins do not collect, store, or transmit any user data or conversation information. All instructional content is provided locally through skill files, and MCP servers only query public Medusa documentation.\n",
