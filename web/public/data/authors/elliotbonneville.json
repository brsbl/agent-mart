        "README.md": "# Cothought\n\nA Claude Code plugin that turns a plain markdown folder into a thinking system. You journal by voice, and the AI captures your words verbatim, links ideas into a zettelkasten note network, and maintains a living self-model called the metamap. Over time, it builds a picture of who you are, what you're working through, and what patterns keep showing up. Then it uses that picture to ask better questions.\n\nThe name is a nod to the ancient *hypomnema* (ὑπόμνημα, *hype-OM-neh-mah*), personal notebooks the Stoics and Epicureans kept for self-examination. They compiled fragments from readings, conversations, and daily life into a structured tool for self-formation. Foucault described them as capturing \"the already said, to collect what one has managed to hear or read, and for a purpose that is nothing less than the shaping of the self.\" Marcus Aurelius kept one. Seneca kept one. This is the version where the notebook thinks back.\n\n[Wikipedia: Hypomnema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomnema) · [Foucault: \"Self Writing\"](https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.hypomnemata.en/)\n\n## Quick start\n\nIn Claude Code, run `/plugins` and add a custom marketplace with the URL `elliotbonneville/claude-cothought`. Then install the cothought plugin from that marketplace.\n\nThen run `/cothought:setup` to create your config. It asks where your notes live, helps you pick a voice dictation tool, and you're done. Run `/cothought:journal` to start your first session.\n\nAll skills are prefixed with `cothought:` since they come from the plugin. You invoke them as `/cothought:journal`, `/cothought:review`, etc.\n\n## What's in the box\n\nEight skills that work together:\n\n- **/cothought:journal** — Voice-to-text capture with verbatim transcription. Two-zone format: conversation above the line, reflections below. Updates the metamap every session.\n- **/cothought:zettelkasten** — Brainstorming and research companion. Creates and links notes with claim-based titles, history tables, back-links. Three note types (concept, reference, structure). Validates all links.\n- **/cothought:review** — Weekly synthesis across journal entries and the note network. Follows links, reads history tables, surfaces patterns, checks progress on configurable life foundations.\n- **/cothought:project** — Captures and researches a project idea into a zettelkasten note with web research and network connections.\n- **/cothought:begin-project** — Spins up a GitHub repo from a project idea note, pulling related zettelkasten context into the repo's docs.\n- **/cothought:voice** — Writing quality skill. Fights AI voice at the architectural level: vocabulary, structure, rhythm, density, subtext. Load alongside other skills when the output needs to sound human.\n- **/cothought:setup** — Interactive first-run configuration. Creates your config file and optionally seeds your notes directory.\n- **/cothought:write-vision** — Guided exercise for creating aspirational \"example day\" passages that ground the whole system.\n\n## The metamap\n\nThe most distinctive piece. A living self-model stored in `metamap.md` that the journal skill updates every session. It draws on research from narrative therapy, CBT, IFS, and reflective practice to maintain a structured picture of who you are right now. It tracks:\n\n- **Who you are right now** — one paragraph, updated constantly. Includes a \"chapter title\" (from Dan McAdams' narrative identity research).\n- **Dominant stories & counter-evidence** — the things you believe about yourself (\"I never finish anything\") alongside dated evidence for and against. Over time, the counter-evidence loosens the story's grip. This is the therapeutic core, drawn from Michael White's narrative therapy.\n- **Pattern map** — recurring trigger → thought → feeling → behavior chains (CBT-style). Both destructive loops and positive ones.\n- **Breakthroughs & experiments** — insights paired with whether they were tested and what happened. Reflection without experimentation is rumination.\n- **Active threads, commitments, open questions, relationships, physical state correlations.**\n\nResearch foundations are documented in [docs/metamap-research.md](docs/metamap-research.md).\n\n## Config\n\nAll skills read `~/.claude/cothought.json` at invocation. Run `/cothought:setup` to create this interactively, or copy and edit the example:\n\n```bash\ncp cothought.example.json ~/.claude/cothought.json\n```\n\nThe only required field is `notes_dir`. Everything else is optional and can be added later — either through `/cothought:setup advanced` or by skills that onboard their own config on first use (e.g., `/cothought:begin-project` asks for your dev directory the first time you use it).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"notes_dir\": \"/path/to/your/notes/\",\n  \"reference_files\": {\n    \"vision\": \"vision/main.md\",\n    \"plan\": \"90-day-plan.md\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSee `cothought.example.json` for a full config with all options.\n\n## How skills connect\n\nThe skills reference each other and form a coherent system:\n\n- Journal loads zettelkasten rules for linking and note creation\n- Review reads history tables created by zettelkasten sessions\n- Project creates notes following zettelkasten conventions\n- Begin-project reads project notes and gathers related zettelkasten context\n- Voice loads alongside journal or any writing task\n\n## Adding personal skills\n\nYou can add your own skills alongside the cothought ones in `~/.claude/skills/`. Personal skills and plugin skills coexist without conflicts. See [docs/customization.md](docs/customization.md) for examples.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
