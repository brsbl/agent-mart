GitHub CLI authentication can be verified with:\n\n```bash\ngh auth status\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAgentize is an AI-powered SDK that helps you build your software projects\nusing Claude Code powerfully. It is splitted into two main components:\n\n1. **Claude Code Plugin**: Automatically registered during installation when `claude` CLI is available.\n   See [Tutorial 00: Initialize Your Project](./docs/tutorial/00-initialize.md) for details.\n2. **CLI Tool**: A source-first CLI tool to help you manage your projects using Agentize.\n   See the commands below to install.\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/main/scripts/install | bash\n```\n\nThen add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):\n\n```bash\nsource $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh\n```\n\nSee [docs/feat/cli/install.md](./docs/feat/cli/install.md) for installation options and troubleshooting.\n\n**Upgrade:** Run `lol upgrade` to pull the latest changes.\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you encounter any issue during the usage. For example:\n1. It asks you for permission on a really simple operation.\n2. It fails to automatically continue on a session.\n\nEnable debug mode in your `.agentize.local.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhandsoff:\n  debug: true\n```\n\nThen re-run the command. This will give you a detailed log in either\n- `/path/to/your/project/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log` or\n- `$HOME/.agentize/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log`\nPaste your logs on issue for me (@were) to debug!\n\nFor further help, please visit our [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshoot.md).\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.\n   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.\n2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/).\n   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.\n   - This is something like C-style declaration and implementation separation.\n     - `/commands` are declarations and interfaces for users to invoke skills.\n     - `/skills` are implementations of the skills.\n3. Bootstrapping via self-improvement: We use `.claude/` as our canonical rules\n   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.\n   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.\n   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally\n     integrate them together.\n\n### Workflow:\n\nSee our detailed workflow diagrams:\n\n- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning\n- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/feat/core/issue-to-impl.md) - Complete development cycle\n\n**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nLearn Agentize in 15 minutes with our step-by-step tutorials (3-5 min each):\n\n1. **[Initialize Your Project](./docs/tutorial/00-initialize.md)** - Set up Agentize in new or existing projects\n   - You already did this if you followed the Quick Start!\n2. **[Ultra Planner](./docs/tutorial/01-ultra-planner.md)** - Primary planning tutorial (recommended)\n3. **[Issue to Implementation](./docs/tutorial/02-issue-to-impl.md)** - Complete development cycle with `/issue-to-impl` and `/code-review`\n4. **[Advanced Usage](./docs/tutorial/03-advanced-usage.md)** - Scale up with parallel development workflows\n\n## Project Organization\n\n```plaintext\nagentize/\n├── .claude-plugin/         # Plugin root (use with --plugin-dir)\n│   ├── marketplace.json    # Plugin manifest\n│   ├── commands/           # Claude Code commands\n│   ├── skills/             # Claude Code skills\n│   ├── agents/             # Claude Code agents\n│   └── hooks/              # Claude Code hooks\n├── python/                 # Python modules (agentize.*)\n├── docs/                   # Documentation\n│   └── git-msg-tags.md     # Commit message conventions\n├── src/cli/                # Source-first CLI libraries\n│   ├── wt.sh               # Worktree CLI library\n│   └── lol.sh              # SDK CLI library\n├── scripts/                # Shell scripts and wrapper entrypoints\n├── templates/              # Templates for SDK generation\n├── tests/                  # Test cases\n├── Makefile                # Build targets for testing and setup\n└── README.md               # This readme file\n```\n"
