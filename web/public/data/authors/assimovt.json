        "README.md": "# Product Skills for Claude Code\n\nAI agent skills for product management — discovery, strategy, prioritization, and PRD writing. Built for PMs and founders who use AI coding agents to ship faster.\n\nEvery skill encodes a real framework (Mom Test, Shape Up, Obviously Awesome, Teresa Torres) as opinionated, actionable instructions. 50-150 lines each. No fluff.\n\nBuilt by [Tair Asim](https://x.com/tair). **Contributions welcome!** Found a way to improve a skill or have a new one to add? [Open a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Install all skills\nnpx skills add assimovt/productskills\n\n# Install specific skills\nnpx skills add assimovt/productskills --skill prd-writing scope-cutting\n\n# List available skills\nnpx skills add assimovt/productskills --list\n```\n\n### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add assimovt/productskills\n/plugin install product-skills\n```\n\n### Option 3: Clone and Copy\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/assimovt/productskills.git\ncp -r productskills/skills/* .claude/skills/\n```\n\n### Option 4: Git Submodule\n\n```bash\ngit submodule add https://github.com/assimovt/productskills.git .claude/productskills\n```\n\nThen reference skills from `.claude/productskills/skills/`.\n\n### Use with other agents\n\nThese skills are markdown files. They work with any AI coding agent:\n\n- **Cursor**: Copy skill files to `.cursor/rules/`\n- **Codex**: Add as knowledge base documents\n- **Devin**: Reference in playbooks\n- **Any LLM**: Use the markdown content as instructions\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [user-interview](skills/user-interview/) | Mom Test + YC's Five Questions — talk to users without leading them |\n| [problem-validation](skills/problem-validation/) | Score problems on frequency x intensity x WTP with evidence |\n| [jtbd-analysis](skills/jtbd-analysis/) | Jobs-to-be-done and Forces of Progress |\n| [research-synthesis](skills/research-synthesis/) | Turn interview notes into atomic insights and patterns |\n| [opportunity-mapping](skills/opportunity-mapping/) | Opportunity Solution Trees (Teresa Torres) |\n| [competitor-analysis](skills/competitor-analysis/) | Feature matrix, positioning map, strategic gaps |\n| [product-positioning](skills/product-positioning/) | April Dunford's Obviously Awesome framework |\n| [strategy-doc](skills/strategy-doc/) | Playing to Win + Rumelt's Strategy Kernel |\n| [feature-prioritization](skills/feature-prioritization/) | RICE scoring with enablers vs blockers lens |\n| [scope-cutting](skills/scope-cutting/) | Shape Up appetite + fixed time/variable scope + scope hammering |\n| [bet-sizing](skills/bet-sizing/) | Shape Up pitch format + Type 1/2 decision framework |\n| [prd-writing](skills/prd-writing/) | Evidence-first PRDs — concise, measurable, with clear scope boundaries |\n| [launch-plan](skills/launch-plan/) | Launch tiers (silent / soft / big-bang) with checklists |\n| [metrics-framework](skills/metrics-framework/) | North Star metric + input/output tree + counter-metrics |\n| [experiment-design](skills/experiment-design/) | Hypothesis-driven A/B tests with sample size and analysis plan |\n| [roadmap-planning](skills/roadmap-planning/) | Now/Next/Later roadmaps — outcomes, not features |\n\n## Skill Categories\n\n### Discovery & Research\n- `user-interview` - Mom Test + YC Five Questions\n- `problem-validation` - Frequency x Intensity x WTP scoring\n- `jtbd-analysis` - Jobs-to-be-done, Forces of Progress\n- `research-synthesis` - Atomic research: nuggets to insights\n- `opportunity-mapping` - Teresa Torres OST\n\n### Strategy & Positioning\n- `competitor-analysis` - Feature matrix, positioning gaps\n- `product-positioning` - April Dunford's Obviously Awesome\n- `strategy-doc` - Playing to Win + Strategy Kernel\n\n### Prioritization & Scoping\n- `feature-prioritization` - RICE + enablers vs blockers\n- `scope-cutting` - Shape Up appetite + scope hammering\n- `bet-sizing` - Shape Up pitch + Type 1/2 decisions\n\n### The PRD\n- `prd-writing` - Evidence-first, 800-1200 words, P0/P1/P2\n\n### Launch & Measure\n- `launch-plan` - Launch tiers with checklists\n- `metrics-framework` - North Star + counter-metrics\n- `experiment-design` - Hypothesis-driven A/B tests\n- `roadmap-planning` - Now/Next/Later, outcome-based\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
