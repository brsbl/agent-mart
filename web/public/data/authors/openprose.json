OpenProse inverts this—you declare agents and control flow, and an AI session wires them up. **The session is the IoC container.**\n\n### 1. The Session as Runtime\n\nOther frameworks orchestrate agents from outside. OpenProse runs *inside* the agent session—the session itself is both interpreter and runtime. It doesn't just match names; it understands context and intent.\n\n### 2. The Fourth Wall (`**...**`)\n\nWhen you need AI judgment instead of strict execution, break out of structure:\n\n```prose\nloop until **the code is production ready**:\n  session \"Review and improve\"\n```\n\nThe `**...**` syntax lets you speak directly to the OpenProse VM. It evaluates this semantically—deciding what \"production ready\" means based on context.\n\n### 3. Open Standard, Zero Lock-in\n\nOpenProse runs on any **Prose Complete** system—a model + harness combination capable of inducing the VM. Currently: Claude Code + Opus, OpenCode + Opus, Amp + Opus. It's not a library you're locked into—it's a language specification.\n\nSwitch platforms anytime. Your `.prose` files work everywhere.\n\n### 4. Structure + Flexibility\n\n**Why not just plain English?** You can—that's what `**...**` is for. But complex workflows need unambiguous structure for control flow. The AI shouldn't have to guess whether you want sequential or parallel execution.\n\n**Why not rigid frameworks?** They're inflexible. OpenProse gives you structure where it matters (control flow, agent definitions) and natural language where you want flexibility (conditions, context passing).\n\n## Update\n\n### Claude Code\n\nEnable auto-updates (recommended):\n```\n/plugin → Marketplaces → prose → Enable auto-update\n```\n\nOr update manually:\n```bash\nclaude plugin update open-prose@prose\n```\n\n### OpenCode\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.config/opencode/skill/open-prose && git pull\n```\n\n### Amp\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.config/agents/skills/open-prose && git pull\n```\n\n## Language Features\n\n| Feature | Example |\n|---------|---------|\n| Agents | `agent researcher: model: sonnet` |\n| Sessions | `session \"prompt\"` or `session: agent` |\n| Persistent Agents | `agent captain: persist: true` / `resume: captain` |\n| Parallel | `parallel:` blocks with join strategies |\n| Variables | `let x = session \"...\"` |\n| Context | `context: [a, b]` or `context: { a, b }` |\n| Fixed Loops | `repeat 3:` and `for item in items:` |\n| Unbounded Loops | `loop until **condition**:` |\n| Error Handling | `try`/`catch`/`finally`, `retry` |\n| Pipelines | `items \\| map: session \"...\"` |\n| Conditionals | `if **condition**:` / `choice **criteria**:` |\n\nSee the [Language Reference](skills/open-prose/compiler.md) for complete documentation.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe `examples/` directory contains 37 example programs:\n\n| Range | Category |\n|-------|----------|\n| 01-08 | Basics (hello world, research, code review, debugging) |\n| 09-12 | Agents and skills |\n| 13-15 | Variables and composition |\n| 16-19 | Parallel execution |\n| 20-21 | Loops and pipelines |\n| 22-23 | Error handling |\n| 24-27 | Advanced (choice, conditionals, blocks, interpolation) |\n| 28 | Gas Town (multi-agent orchestration) |\n| 29-31 | Captain's chair pattern (persistent orchestrator) |\n| 33-36 | Production workflows (PR auto-fix, content pipeline, feature factory, bug hunter) |\n| 37 | The Forge (build a browser from scratch) |\n\nStart with `01-hello-world.prose` or try `37-the-forge.prose` to watch AI build a web browser.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### The OpenProse VM\n\nLLMs are simulators. When given a detailed system description, they don't just describe it—they *simulate* it. The OpenProse specification (`prose.md`) describes a virtual machine with enough fidelity that a Prose Complete system reading it *becomes* that VM.\n\nThis isn't metaphor: each `session` triggers a real subagent, outputs are real artifacts, and state persists in conversation history or files. Simulation with sufficient fidelity is implementation.\n\nThe VM maps traditional components to emergent structures:\n\n| Aspect | Behavior |\n|--------|----------|\n| Execution order | **Strict** — follows program exactly |\n| Session creation | **Strict** — creates what program specifies |\n| Parallel coordination | **Strict** — executes as specified |\n| Context passing | **Intelligent** — summarizes/transforms as needed |\n| Condition evaluation | **Intelligent** — interprets `**...**` semantically |\n| Completion detection | **Intelligent** — determines when \"done\" |\n\n### Documentation Files\n\n| File | Purpose | When to Load |\n|------|---------|--------------|\n| `prose.md` | VM / Interpreter | Load to run programs |\n| `compiler.md` | Compiler / Validator | Only when compiling or validating |\n| `state/filesystem.md` | File-based state (default) | Load with VM |\n| `state/in-context.md` | In-context state | For simple programs (<30 statements) |\n| `state/sqlite.md` | SQLite state (experimental) | On request with `--state=sqlite` |\n| `state/postgres.md` | PostgreSQL state (experimental) | On request with `--state=postgres` |\n\n### Experimental: SQLite State\n\nRun with `--state=sqlite` for queryable, transaction-safe state management. Requires `sqlite3` CLI:\n\n| Platform | Availability |\n|----------|--------------|\n| macOS | Pre-installed |\n| Linux | `apt install sqlite3` or equivalent |\n| Windows | `winget install SQLite.SQLite` |\n\n### Experimental: PostgreSQL State\n\nRun with `--state=postgres` for true concurrent writes, network access, and external system integration.\n\n**⚠️ Bring Your Own Database:** You are responsible for providing and managing your PostgreSQL instance. OpenProse does not provision databases for you.\n\n**⚠️ Security Warning:** Database credentials in `OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL` are passed to subagent sessions and will be visible in agent context/logs. **Treat these credentials as non-sensitive.** Use:\n- A dedicated database for OpenProse (not your production DB)\n- A user with minimal privileges (just the `openprose` schema)\n- Credentials you're comfortable being logged\n\n**Setup:**\n\n| Platform | Setup |\n|----------|-------|\n| macOS | `brew install postgresql@16` + `brew services start postgresql@16` |\n| Linux | `apt install postgresql` |\n| Windows | PostgreSQL installer or Docker |\n| Cloud | Neon, Supabase, Railway, etc. |\n| Docker | `docker run -d --name prose-pg -e POSTGRES_DB=prose -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 5432:5432 postgres:16` |\n\n**Configure connection:**\n```bash\nmkdir -p .prose\necho \"OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/prose\" >> .prose/.env\n```\n\nPostgreSQL state is for power users who need concurrent parallel writes or external dashboard integration.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why not LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen?**\nThose are orchestration libraries—they coordinate agents from outside. OpenProse runs inside the agent session—the session itself is the IoC container. Zero external dependencies, portable across any AI assistant.\n\n**Why not just plain English?**\nYou can use `**...**` for that. But complex workflows need unambiguous structure for control flow—the AI shouldn't guess whether you want sequential or parallel execution.\n\n**What's \"intelligent IoC\"?**\nTraditional IoC containers (Spring, Guice) wire up dependencies from configuration. OpenProse's container is an AI session that wires up agents using *understanding*. It doesn't just match names—it understands context, intent, and can make intelligent decisions about execution.\n\n## Beta & Legal\n\n### Beta Status\n\nOpenProse is in **beta**.
