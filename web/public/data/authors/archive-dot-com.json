        "README.md": "# Creator Marketing Skills\n\nAI-powered skills for creator marketing teams at consumer brands and agencies. Built by [Archive.com](https://archive.com).\n\n## What This Is\n\nA collection of Claude Code skills that automate the repetitive, manual work in creator marketing — writing briefs, vetting creators, generating reports, crafting outreach, and more. Each skill encodes real creator marketing expertise so the output is ready to use, not just a starting point.\n\n## Who It's For\n\n- **Brands** running creator programs (beauty, fashion, wellness, food, lifestyle)\n- **Agencies** managing creator campaigns for brand clients\n- From solo founders sourcing their first creators to Enterprise VPs managing thousands of partnerships\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)\n\nUse [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:\n\n```bash\n# Install all skills\nnpx skills add archive-dot-com/creator-marketing-skills\n\n# Install specific skills\nnpx skills add archive-dot-com/creator-marketing-skills --skill brand-context creator-outreach-sequence-generator\n\n# List available skills\nnpx skills add archive-dot-com/creator-marketing-skills --list\n```\n\nThis automatically installs to your `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin\n\nInstall via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add archive-dot-com/creator-marketing-skills\n\n# Install all creator marketing skills\n/plugin install creator-marketing-skills\n```\n\n### Option 3: Clone and Copy\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/archive-dot-com/creator-marketing-skills.git\ncp -r creator-marketing-skills/skills/* .claude/skills/\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Start here: run `/brand-context` first.** This skill scrapes your brand's website and asks a few creator-marketing-specific questions to build a shared context file. Every other skill reads this file automatically — so you only describe your brand once.\n\n```\n/brand-context\n```\n\nAfter that, use any skill and it will already know your brand, audience, platforms, and goals.\n\n## Usage\n\nJust ask Claude Code to help with creator marketing tasks:\n\n```\n\"Write outreach DMs for these 5 creators\"\n→ Uses creator-outreach-sequence-generator\n\n\"Is this creator's audience a good fit for our brand?\"\n→ Uses audience-demographic-analyzer\n\n\"Check if this caption is FTC compliant\"\n→ Uses ftc-disclosure-spot-checker\n\n\"Turn our team's feedback into a revision request for the creator\"\n→ Uses content-approval-feedback-formatter\n```\n\nYou can also invoke skills directly:\n\n```\n/creator-outreach-sequence-generator\n/niche-fit-scorer\n/campaign-roi-calculator\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n### Setup\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [brand-context](skills/brand-context/) | Scrape your website + answer a few questions to set up shared brand context.
