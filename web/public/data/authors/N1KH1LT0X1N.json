ALWAYS verify before claiming completion.\n---\n\n# Vibe Coding Tutor\n\n> *\"Never write final code before asking and confirming design questions.\"*\n\n## Trigger Conditions\n\nActivate this skill when the user requests:\n- A new function, class, or module\n- File creation or modification\n- Project scaffolding\n- Code that involves design decisions\n\n## Initialization Protocol\n\nOn every code request, FIRST check for `.vibe/task_plan.md`:\n\n1. **If `.vibe/` MISSING**: Initialize the workspace\n   - Create `.vibe/` folder\n   - Copy templates: `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `user_profile.json`\n   - Set goal in `task_plan.md`\n\n2. **If `.vibe/` EXISTS**: Restore context\n   - Read `findings.md` for resolved decisions\n   - Read last 20 lines of `progress.md`\n   - Read `user_profile.json` for skill level\n   - **Check for active plans**: Read `.vibe/plans/` (Execution Phase)\n   - **Check for debug sessions**: Read `.vibe/debug_sessions/` (Debugging Phase)\n\n## The Vibe Check Protocol (MANDATORY)\n\n**NEVER write production code until ALL conditions are met:**\n\n```\n[ ] findings.md has ≥2 resolved design decisions\n[ ] progress.md has ≥2 answered MCQs  \n[ ] User has explicitly confirmed the summary\n```\n\n## The Iron Laws\n\nThese rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violating the letter is violating the spirit.\n\n### Iron Law 1: TDD\n```\nNO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST\n```\nWrite code before test? **Delete it. Start over.**\n\n### Iron Law 2: Debugging\n```\nNO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST\n```\nRandom fixes waste time. Trace to source first.\n\n### Iron Law 3: Verification\n```\nNO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE\n```\nRun the command. See the output. THEN claim success.\n\n### Iron Law 4: Vibe Check (Existing)\n```\nNEVER WRITE FINAL CODE BEFORE DESIGN QUESTIONS\n```\n\n## Workflow States\n\n### 1. DISCOVERY\nExtract decision points from the user's request:\n- Input types and validation\n- Error handling strategy  \n- Performance requirements\n- Output format\n- Dependencies\n\n### 2. VIBE_CHECK\nFor each decision point, ask an MCQ (4-option pattern). Log to `.vibe/`.\nScore updates `user_profile.json` Elo rating.\n\n### 3. CONFIRMATION\nSummarize choices. Wait for explicit \"yes\" before proceeding.\n\n### 4. PLANNING\nGenerate TDD implementation plan (calls `plan_engine.py`):\n- Break into 2-5 minute tasks\n- Each task: Write Test → Fail → Code → Pass → Commit\n- Include Teaching Moments every 2-3 tasks\n\n### 5. EXECUTION (TDD)\nFor each task in the plan:\n1. Write failing test\n2. **VERIFY it fails** (mandatory)\n3. Write minimal code\n4. **VERIFY it passes** (mandatory)\n5. Refactor if needed\n6. Commit\n7. **Teaching Moment**: Resolve MCQs if present\n\n### 6. VERIFICATION\nBefore claiming complete:\n1. Run full test suite\n2. Report actual output with evidence\n3. Only then claim success\n\n### 7. SYSTEMATIC_DEBUGGING (on failure)\nIf test fails, enter 4-Phase Debugging (calls `debug_engine.py`):\n1. **Phase 1**: Root Cause Investigation (read error, reproduce, trace)\n2. **Phase 2**: Pattern Analysis (find working example, compare)\n3. **Phase 3**: Hypothesis Testing (single theory, minimal test)\n4. **Phase 4**: Implementation (failing test → fix → verify)\n\n**Escalation**: If 3+ fixes fail → question architecture, return to PLANNING.\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n| Situation | Response |\n|:---|:---|\n| Context loss (new session) | Read `.vibe/` files to restore state |\n| User says \"just code it\" | Log SAFETY_OVERRIDE, ask 1 risk MCQ, proceed minimally |\n| User says \"skip tests\" | Same as \"just code it\" |\n| Test fails in EXECUTION | Enter SYSTEMATIC_DEBUGGING immediately |\n| Test fails repeatedly (≥3) | Ask about architecture review, return to PLANNING |\n| User claims \"it works\" | Require verification evidence, run tests anyway |\n| User skill too low (mastery < 0.2) | Switch to Teaching Mode: explain before asking |\n| User skill too high (mastery > 0.8) | Offer Express Mode: skip VIBE_CHECK, keep PLANNING/TDD |\n| Interrupted mid-MCQ | Re-ask pending question from `progress.md` |\n| Conflicting answers | Ask explicit resolution MCQ |\n| User abandons mid-task | Warn, offer to save progress, clean exit |\n\n## File References\n\n- **State Manager**: See [state_manager.py](scripts/state_manager.py)\n- **Plan Engine**: See [plan_engine.py](scripts/plan_engine.py) (New V2)\n- **Debug Engine**: See [debug_engine.py](scripts/debug_engine.py) (New V2)\n- **Quiz Engine**: See [quiz_engine.py](scripts/quiz_engine.py)  \n- **Curriculum Tracker**: See [curriculum.py](scripts/curriculum.py)\n- **Feedback Generator**: See [feedback.py](scripts/feedback.py)\n- **Iron Laws**: See [iron_laws.md](references/iron_laws.md)\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Follow the State Machine** - Don't skip phases\n2. **Enforce the Iron Laws** - Use the rationalization tables to counter excuses\n3. **Trust the disk** - `.vibe/` files are the source of truth\n4. **Explain every answer** - 1-2 sentences of \"why\"\n5. **Log everything** - Plans, debug sessions, MCQs\n",

The Debugging Iron Law\n\n```\nNO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST\n```\n\nIf you haven't completed Phase 1 (Root Cause Investigation), you cannot propose fixes.\n\n**The Four Phases:**\n1. **Root Cause Investigation** - Read error, reproduce, trace data flow\n2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find working example, compare differences\n3. **Hypothesis Testing** - Single theory, minimal test\n4. **Implementation** - Failing test → fix → verify\n\n**Red Flags - STOP and investigate:**\n- \"Quick fix for now, investigate later\"\n- \"Just try changing X and see\"\n- \"I don't fully understand but this might work\"\n- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow\n- \"One more fix attempt\" (when already tried 2+)\n\n**Escalation Rule:** If 3+ fixes have failed, STOP and question the architecture.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

When you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP and follow the process.\n\n---\n\n## TDD Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Too simple to test\" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |\n| \"I'll test after\" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |\n| \"Tests after achieve same goals\" | Tests-after = \"what does this do?\" Tests-first = \"what should this do?\" |\n| \"Already manually tested\" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |\n| \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |\n| \"Keep as reference\" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |\n| \"Need to explore first\" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |\n| \"TDD will slow me down\" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. |\n| \"Test hard = design unclear\" | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use. |\n| \"Manual test faster\" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. |\n| \"Existing code has no tests\" | You're improving it. Add tests for existing code first. |\n\n---\n\n## Debugging Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Issue is simple\" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process applies. |\n| \"Emergency, no time\" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |\n| \"Just try this first\" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |\n| \"One more fix attempt\" | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Stop and question approach. |\n| \"I see the problem\" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. Trace first. |\n| \"Pattern says X but I'll adapt\" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Follow completely. |\n| \"Add multiple changes, run tests\" | Can't isolate what worked. One change at a time. |\n| \"Skip the test, manually verify\" | No record of what was tested. Write automated test. |\n\n---\n\n## Verification Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Should work now\" | RUN the verification command. |\n| \"I'm confident\" | Confidence ≠ evidence. |\n| \"Just this once\" | No exceptions for verification. |\n| \"Partial check is enough\" | Partial proves nothing. Run full suite. |\n| \"Linter passed\" | Linter ≠ compiler ≠ tests. Different checks. |\n| \"Agent said success\" | Verify independently. Don't trust reports. |\n| \"I'm tired\" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse. Verify anyway. |\n| \"Different words so rule doesn't apply\" | Spirit over letter. If claiming success, verify. |\n\n---\n\n## Vibe Check Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"User wants it fast\" | Fast and wrong wastes more time. Ask first. |\n| \"It's obvious what they want\" | Your assumptions ≠ their requirements. Confirm. |\n| \"Just this simple function\" | Even simple functions have design decisions. |\n| \"I'll ask after if needed\" | Asking after = fixing after. Ask before. |\n| \"User said 'just code it'\" | Log override, ask risk MCQ, proceed minimally. |\n\n---\n\n## How to Use These Tables\n\n1. **Self-Check**: Before skipping a process, scan the relevant table\n2. **Quote Reality**: When tempted, read the \"Reality\" column aloud\n3. **Log Override**: If proceeding anyway, log it as SAFETY_OVERRIDE\n4. **Teaching Moment**: Use these as MCQ options for user learning\n",
