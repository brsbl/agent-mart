Updates plugin.json and README automatically\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\n/plugin-builder:add\n```\n\n### `/plugin-builder:edit`\n\nUse natural language to make edits to your existing plugin components with specialized builder skill assistance.\n\n**Use this when:**\n\n- You want to modify an existing command, agent, hook, skill, or MCP server\n- You need to update functionality, fix issues, or refactor a component\n- You want to make changes using conversational descriptions instead of manual file editing\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Select which plugin to edit\n2. Choose which component to modify\n3. Describe your desired changes in natural language\n4. Appropriate builder skill is invoked with context about the existing component:\n   - **Commands**: `cc-command-builder` helps apply changes\n   - **Agents**: `cc-agent-builder` helps apply changes\n   - **Hooks**: `cc-hook-builder` helps apply changes\n   - **Skills**: `cc-skill-builder` helps apply changes\n   - **MCP Servers**: `cc-mcp-builder` helps apply changes\n5. Builder skill interprets your intent and applies edits following best practices\n6. Review the changes and confirm\n7. Optionally update README and version number\n\n**Example natural language edits:**\n\n- \"Add validation for email addresses\"\n- \"Make it ask for confirmation before deleting\"\n- \"Change the default model from haiku to sonnet\"\n- \"Add better error handling\"\n- \"Include usage examples in the documentation\"\n- \"Make it work with TypeScript files too\"\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\n/plugin-builder:edit\n```\n\n### `/plugin-builder:validate`\n\nValidate plugin structure and configuration.\n\n**Checks:**\n\n- Required files exist (plugin.json, component files)\n- Directory structure is correct\n- JSON files are valid\n- Plugin manifest has required fields\n- Component files match what's listed in plugin.json\n- Names follow kebab-case convention\n- No duplicate component names\n- README exists and contains key information\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- ✓ List of passed checks\n- ✗ List of failed checks with fixes\n- ⚠ Warnings and recommendations\n- Actionable next steps\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\n/plugin-builder:validate\n```\n\n### `/plugin-builder:publish`\n\nPublish your plugin changes to the Claude Market marketplace with automated validation, manifest generation, and pull request creation.\n\n**Use this when:**\n\n- You've made changes to a plugin and want to submit them to the marketplace\n- You want to add a new plugin to the Claude Market\n- You need an automated workflow from validation to PR creation\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. **Detect changes**: Runs `git diff main` to identify which plugins have been modified\n2. **Validate in parallel**: Runs `/plugin-builder:validate` for each changed plugin simultaneously\n3. **Generate manifest**: Runs `make generate-marketplace-json` to update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n4. **Create semantic commit**: Generates a commit message following conventional commits format\n5. **Branch management**: Creates a new branch (if on main) in format `{user}/{plugin}/{description}`\n6. **Create PR**: Uses GitHub CLI to create a pull request with pre-filled template\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Changes must be committed to a git branch\n- All changed plugins must pass validation\n- `make` must be available (for marketplace.json generation)\n- `gh` CLI is recommended but optional (for automated PR creation)\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```\n/plugin-builder:publish\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n\n- Validates all changed plugins in parallel\n- Stops if any validation fails\n- Generates semantic commit message like `feat(plugin-name): added new command`\n- Creates branch like `danielkov/plugin-name/add-new-command`\n- Opens PR with filled-in template including plugin metadata, components, and testing checklist\n\n**Without GitHub CLI:**\n\nIf `gh` CLI is not installed, the command will provide a manual PR link and suggest installing GitHub CLI for future use.\n\n## Builder Skills\n\nThe plugin-builder includes specialized builder skills for each Claude Code component type. These skills are invoked automatically by the `/add` and `/edit` commands to provide expert guidance following industry best practices.\n\n### `cc-skill-builder`\n\nClaude Code Skill Builder - Expert guidance for creating highly effective Claude Code skills.\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- Skill structure (YAML frontmatter + markdown content)\n- Effective prompt engineering techniques\n- Tool permission optimization\n- Progressive disclosure patterns\n- Resource organization (scripts, references, assets)\n- Common skill patterns and workflows\n\n**Based on:** [Claude Skills Deep Dive](https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/10/26/claude-skills-deep-dive/)\n\n### `cc-command-builder`\n\nSlash Command Builder - Expert guidance for creating slash commands.\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- Markdown structure with optional YAML frontmatter\n- Argument handling ($ARGUMENTS vs positional parameters)\n- Tool permissions and security\n- Bash execution and file references\n- Prompt engineering for commands\n\n**Based on:** [Claude Code Slash Commands Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)\n\n### `cc-agent-builder`\n\nSubagent Builder - Expert guidance for creating specialized subagents.\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- System prompt design\n- Context isolation strategies\n- Tool permissions (inherit vs explicit)\n- Model selection guidance\n- Workflow and success criteria definition\n\n**Based on:** [Claude Code Subagents Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)\n\n### `cc-hook-builder`\n\nHook Builder - Expert guidance for creating workflow automation hooks.\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- Hook event selection (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)\n- Matcher configuration for targeting tools\n- Shell script creation with jq parsing\n- Blocking vs non-blocking operations\n- Security best practices\n\n**Based on:** [Claude Code Hooks Guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide)\n\n### `cc-mcp-builder`\n\nMCP Server Configuration Builder - Expert guidance for configuring MCP servers.\n\n**Provides:**\n\n- Transport type selection (HTTP, stdio, SSE)\n- Environment variable handling\n- Authentication configuration\n- Scope selection (project vs user)\n- Platform-specific considerations\n\n**Based on:** [Claude Code MCP Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)\n\n### How Builder Skills Work\n\nBuilder skills follow the [Anthropic Context Engineering Guide](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) principles:\n\n1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed incrementally as needed\n2. **Minimal Context** - Only essential details in frontmatter, detailed guidance on invocation\n3. **Tool Efficiency** - Curated minimal tool sets for each builder\n4. **Structured Guidance** - Clear step-by-step workflows\n5. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard patterns and anti-patterns\n\nWhen you use `/plugin-builder:add` or `/plugin-builder:edit`, the appropriate builder skill is automatically invoked to guide you through creation or modification with expert knowledge specific to that component type.\n\n## Component Types\n\n### Slash Commands\n\nCustom shortcuts invoked as `/plugin-name:command-name`. Use for frequently-used operations, scaffolding, or complex workflows.\n\n### Agents (Subagents)\n\nSpecialized agents for specific development tasks. They can have restricted tool access and custom prompts optimized for their purpose.\n\n### Hooks\n\nBehavior customizations that run at key workflow points (before user input, before/after tool calls, agent start/end).\n\n### Skills\n\nDomain-specific expertise that can be invoked when needed. Skills provide specialized knowledge without always being active.\n\n### MCP Servers\n\nIntegration with Model Context Protocol servers to add external tools and data sources.\n\n## Example Plugin Structure\n\nThis plugin itself demonstrates proper structure:\n\n```\nplugin-builder/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json              # Plugin manifest\n├── commands/\n│   ├── init.md                  # Init command\n│   ├── add.md                   # Add command (routes to builder skills)\n│   ├── edit.md                  # Edit command (routes to builder skills)\n│   ├── validate.md              # Validate command\n│   └── publish.md               # Publish command\n├── skills/\n│   ├── cc-skill-builder.md      # Skill builder\n│   ├── cc-command-builder.md    # Slash command builder\n│   ├── cc-agent-builder.md      # Subagent builder\n│   ├── cc-hook-builder.md       # Hook builder\n│   └── cc-mcp-builder.md        # MCP server builder\n├── CODEOWNERS                   # Maintainers\n├── LICENSE                      # MIT License\n└── README.md                    # This file\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen creating plugins with this tool:\n\n1. **Write detailed prompts** - The quality of your plugin depends on clear, comprehensive instructions\n2. **Include examples** - Show expected behavior and usage patterns\n3. **Handle edge cases** - Think about what could go wrong and address it\n4. **Use proper naming** - Always use kebab-case for component names\n5. **Provide clear descriptions** - Help users understand what each component does\n6. **Add keywords** - Improve discoverability in marketplaces\n7. **Test before publishing** - Use `/plugin-builder:validate` to check for issues\n\n## Plugin Manifest Reference\n\nThe plugin.json file structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"What this plugin does\",\n  \"author\": \"Your Name\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"relevant\", \"keywords\"],\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"command-name\",\n      \"description\": \"What the command does\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"agent-name\",\n      \"description\": \"What the agent does\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"hooks\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"hook-name\",\n      \"description\": \"What the hook does\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"skills\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"skill-name\",\n      \"description\": \"What the skill does\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"mcpServers\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"server-name\",\n      \"description\": \"What the server provides\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing to Claude Market\n\nOnce you've created and validated your plugin:\n\n1.

        "specforge-backend-rust-axum/README.md": "# SpecForge Backend: Rust + Axum\n\n**Backend framework expertise plugin for SpecForge** - Makes Claude Code an expert in implementing API backends using Rust, Axum, OpenAPI-generated types, and database-generated query functions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin teaches Claude Code how to:\n- Build production-ready REST APIs with Rust and Axum\n- Stitch together OpenAPI-generated types with database-generated query functions\n- Implement framework-specific patterns (routing, middleware, extractors, state)\n- Apply distributed systems patterns (idempotency, retries, circuit breakers, tracing)\n- Write comprehensive tests using generated types\n- Set up Docker-based development environments\n\n## What Gets Generated\n\nThe plugin works with code generated from two sources:\n\n1. **OpenAPI Generator** → Request/Response types (`src/generated/api/`)\n2. **Database Codegen Plugin** → Query functions (`src/generated/db/`)\n\nThe backend plugin teaches how to **combine** these generated pieces using Axum framework patterns.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin install ./specforge-backend-rust-axum\n```\n\n## Skills Included\n\n### Core Framework Skills (7)\n\n1. **axum-patterns** - Router setup, extractors, state management\n2. **axum-handler-implementation** - Business logic patterns for handlers\n3. **axum-error-mapping** - Map errors to OpenAPI schemas\n4. **rust-testing** - Test patterns using generated types\n5. **axum-middleware** - CORS, logging, auth middleware\n6. **rust-openapi-integration** - Using OpenAPI generators\n7. **rust-dev-setup** - Docker Compose configuration\n\n### Distributed System Skills (6)\n\n8. **axum-idempotency** - Idempotent handlers with Redis\n9. **axum-resilience** - Retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers\n10. **axum-tracing** - Request tracing with correlation IDs\n11. **axum-timeouts** - Request and operation timeouts\n12. **axum-health-shutdown** - Health checks and graceful shutdown\n13. **axum-rate-limiting** - Rate limiting with tower-governor\n\n## Agents Included\n\n### 1. Handler Implementer\n\nImplements HTTP handlers by combining OpenAPI-generated types with DB-generated functions.\n\n**Input:**\n- OpenAPI endpoint definition\n- Path to generated API types\n- Path to generated DB functions\n\n**Output:**\n- Complete handler implementation with business logic\n\n**Model:** Haiku (fast and efficient for CRUD handlers)\n\n### 2. Test Generator\n\nGenerates comprehensive test suites for handlers using generated types.\n\n**Input:**\n- Handler path and function name\n- Endpoint definition\n- Path to generated API types\n\n**Output:**\n- Complete test suite with success and error cases\n\n**Model:** Haiku\n\n### 3. Router Builder\n\nWires up all handlers into an Axum router with middleware.\n\n**Input:**\n- List of handlers with paths, methods, and handler names\n- Handler module names\n\n**Output:**\n- Complete router configuration with middleware\n\n**Model:** Haiku\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Creating a User Handler\n\nGiven this OpenAPI endpoint:\n\n```yaml\npaths:\n  /api/users:\n    post:\n      operationId: createUser\n      description: Create a new user. Check for duplicate email before creating.\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateUserRequest'\n      responses:\n        '201':\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'\n```\n\nThe handler-implementer agent generates:\n\n```rust\nuse axum::{extract::State, http::StatusCode, Json};\nuse crate::{\n    generated::api::{CreateUserRequest, User, ErrorResponse},\n    generated::db::{create_user, get_user_by_email},\n    state::AppState,\n};\n\npub async fn create_user_handler(\n    State(state): State<AppState>,\n    Json(payload): Json<CreateUserRequest>,\n) -> Result<(StatusCode, Json<User>), ErrorResponse> {\n    // Business logic: Check for duplicate email\n    if get_user_by_email(&state.db, &payload.email).await?.is_some() {\n        return Err(ErrorResponse::conflict(\"Email already exists\"));\n    }\n\n    // Create user using DB-generated function\n    let user = create_user(&state.db, &payload.email, &payload.name).await?;\n\n    Ok((StatusCode::CREATED, Json(user)))\n}\n```\n\n## Integration with SpecForge\n\nThis plugin is part of the SpecForge ecosystem:\n\n1. **SpecForge Database Plugin** → Manages database schema and migrations\n2. **SpecForge Codegen Plugin** → Generates DB query functions\n3. **SpecForge Backend Plugin** (this plugin) → Implements API handlers\n4. **SpecForge Client Plugin** → Generates frontend API clients\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Rust 1.75+\n- Axum 0.7+\n- SQLx or compatible database driver\n- OpenAPI 3.0+ specification\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**The backend plugin does NOT define types.** Types come from:\n- OpenAPI generator (request/response schemas)\n- Codegen plugin (database models, query functions)\n\nThe backend plugin teaches how to:\n- Use framework patterns (routing, middleware, extractors)\n- Wire together generated types + generated DB functions\n- Implement business logic between API and database layers\n- Handle errors using generated error schemas\n- Write tests using generated types\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Install the plugin: `/plugin install ./specforge-backend-rust-axum`\n2. Use with SpecForge database and codegen plugins\n3. Invoke agents to implement handlers from your OpenAPI spec\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Emod Kovacs (@danielkov)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! Please ensure:\n- All skills follow the implementation-only pattern (code, not concepts)\n- Agents use appropriate models (Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex)\n- Examples use OpenAPI-generated and DB-generated types\n- Code follows Rust and Axum best practices"
