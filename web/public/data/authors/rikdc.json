        "README.md": "# Reeds\n\nAutonomous multi-task development loops powered by Beads issue tracking.\n\n**Ralph Loop + Beads integration for Claude Code.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code CLI installed\n- [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) initialized in your project (`bd init`)\n- `bd` CLI available in PATH\n- `jq` for JSON processing\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins\ngit clone https://github.com/rikdc/reeds\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code to load the plugin.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nIf you prefer symlinks:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rikdc/reeds ~/tools/reeds\nln -s ~/tools/reeds/reeds ~/.claude/plugins/reeds\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Start a Loop\n\n```text\n/reeds-start [--max-iterations N]\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n- `--max-iterations N` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)\n- `-h, --help` - Show help\n\n### Check Status\n\n```text\n/reeds-status\n```\n\nShows current iteration, max iterations, and Beads task statistics.\n\n### Cancel Loop\n\n```text\n/reeds-cancel\n```\n\nRemoves the state file and stops the autonomous loop.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. `/reeds-start` creates a state file at `.claude/reeds-state.local.md`\n2. Claude receives instructions to work through the Beads backlog\n3. For each iteration, Claude:\n   - Queries `bd ready --limit 1` for the next task\n   - Reads task details with `bd show <task-id>`\n   - Implements the task fully\n   - Closes the task with `bd close <task-id> --reason \"...\"`\n4. When Claude tries to exit, the stop hook intercepts and:\n   - Checks if \"REEDS COMPLETE\" or \"ALL TASKS COMPLETE\" was output\n   - If not, increments the iteration counter and continues the loop\n5. Loop ends when:\n   - Claude outputs \"REEDS COMPLETE\" (no more ready tasks)\n   - Max iterations reached\n   - State file is corrupted or missing\n\n## Task Completion\n\nWhen all tasks are done and `bd ready` returns nothing, output:\n\n```text\nREEDS COMPLETE\n```\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n```text\nALL TASKS COMPLETE\n```\n\n**Important**: Only output these when genuinely complete. The loop will continue until one of these signals is detected.\n\n## State File\n\nState is stored in `.claude/reeds-state.local.md` with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```yaml\n---\niteration: 1\nmax_iterations: 0\n---\n```\n\nThe body of the file contains the prompt instructions for Claude.\n\nFields:\n\n- `iteration` - Current iteration number (incremented by stop hook)\n- `max_iterations` - Maximum iterations before stopping (0 = unlimited)\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```text\nreeds/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json       # Plugin manifest\n├── commands/\n│   ├── reeds-start.md    # Start command definition\n│   ├── reeds-status.md   # Status command definition\n│   └── reeds-cancel.md   # Cancel command definition\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── hooks.json        # Hook configuration\n│   └── stop-hook.sh      # Stop hook script\n├── scripts/\n│   └── setup-reeds.sh    # Setup script called by /reeds-start\n└── README.md             # This file\n```\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Initialize a project with Beads\ncd my-project\nbd init\n\n# Create some tasks\nbd create \"Set up project structure\" --priority 1\nbd create \"Implement core feature\" --priority 2\nbd create \"Add tests\" --priority 3\n\n# Open in Claude Code\nclaude\n\n# Start the autonomous loop\n/reeds-start --max-iterations 10\n```\n\nClaude will work through each task, closing them as they're completed, until no ready tasks remain.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Loop won't start\n\n- Ensure Beads is initialized: `bd init`\n- Check for ready tasks: `bd ready`\n- Verify `bd` is in PATH: `which bd`\n\n### Loop stops unexpectedly\n\n- Check `.claude/reeds-state.local.md` exists\n- Look for error messages in Claude's output\n- Max iterations may have been reached\n\n### Tasks not being picked up\n\n- Ensure tasks are in `open` status: `bd list`\n- Check for dependency blocks: `bd blocked`\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe `/prd-to-beads` skill is adapted from [ralph-tui](https://github.com/human-ui/ralph-tui) (MIT License).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
