        "README.md": "# TasteRay Skills\n\nSkills that give AI agents the ability to understand people — what drives them, what they value, and what they'll love next.\n\nBuilt on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard. Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), [Roo Code](https://roocode.com), and [other compatible agents](https://agentskills.io/home).\n\n## What These Skills Do\n\nTasteRay skills turn your AI agent into a perceptive conversationalist. Instead of asking blunt survey questions, the agent uses research-backed techniques to understand users through natural dialogue — then applies that understanding to deliver genuinely personalized recommendations.\n\nThe two skills work together:\n\n1. **Elicitation** — Understands who someone is through conversation\n2. **Recommendations** — Uses that understanding to recommend what they'll love\n\n## Elicitation\n\nDeep psychological profiling through patient, research-backed conversation. Your agent learns to uncover values, motivations, and formative experiences — not by interrogating, but by creating space for authentic self-disclosure.\n\n**What it enables:**\n- Understand someone's core values and motivations\n- Discover formative memories and life-defining experiences\n- Detect emotional schemas and belief patterns\n- Build psychological profiles through gradual disclosure\n- Conduct user interviews that reveal deep insights\n\n**Grounded in research from:**\n- McAdams' Life Story Interview (8 key scenes)\n- Singer's Self-Defining Memory elicitation\n- OARS framework from Motivational Interviewing\n- Schema detection via downward arrow technique\n- Schwartz's Universal Values elicitation\n- Haight's Structured Life Review\n- Birren's Guided Autobiography themes\n\n**Try it:**\n- \"Help me understand this user's core motivations\"\n- \"Design an interview to uncover their values\"\n- \"Analyze this conversation for psychological patterns\"\n\n## Recommendations\n\nPersonalized recommendations powered by the TasteRay API. Your agent builds rich context from conversation — preferences, constraints, history, psychological profile — then delivers recommendations with explanations that connect to what actually matters to the user.\n\n**Supported verticals:**\n- Movies & TV\n- Restaurants\n- Products\n- Travel destinations\n- Jobs\n\n**What it enables:**\n- Answer \"what would I like?\" with genuine personalization\n- Rank and score items based on individual taste\n- Explain *why* something is a good match\n- Combine with elicitation for deeper psychological context\n\n**Try it:**\n- \"Recommend some movies for me\"\n- \"What restaurant would I like near downtown?\"\n- \"Help me find my next travel destination\"\n- \"Why would I like this movie?\"\n\n## About TasteRay\n\n[TasteRay](https://www.tasteray.com) is an Emotional AI Recommendations API. It delivers personalized recommendations with human-readable explanations across 25+ verticals — movies, restaurants, travel, jobs, books, music, and more — using frontier LLMs combined with real-time web grounding.\n\nThe [TasteRay API](https://api.tasteray.com) accepts user context in any format (conversation excerpts, preference lists, unstructured profiles) and returns ranked recommendations with match scores, \"why match\" explanations, and key decision factors. Simple REST JSON interface, <3s p95 latency, 99.9% uptime SLA.\n\nThese skills bring TasteRay's capabilities directly into any compatible AI agent — no integration work required.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):\n\n```bash\n# Install a specific skill\nnpx skills add tasteray/skills/elicitation\nnpx skills add tasteray/skills/recommendations\n\n# Install all skills\nnpx skills add tasteray/skills\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT — See [LICENSE](./LICENSE)\n"
