        "README.md": "# Gremlins\n\nDisciplined engineering workflows for AI-assisted development. Helpful little creatures that fix things when you invoke them properly.\n\n## How It Works\n\nYou write natural language. Gremlins recognizes what you're trying to do and applies the right workflow automatically.\n\n### The Workflow: Plan → Implement → Review\n\nMost work follows this cycle:\n\n1. **Plan** - Clarify what you're building, explore approaches, write it down\n2. **Implement** - Work through the plan systematically with tests\n3. **Review** - Verify the work before calling it done\n\nYou don't need to remember this - just describe what you want and gremlins guides you through the appropriate steps.\n\n### Examples\n\n**Building something new:**\n> \"I want to add a dark mode toggle to the settings page\"\n\nGremlins asks clarifying questions, proposes design options, creates an implementation plan, then works through it with tests.\n\n**Fixing a bug:**\n> \"The login form isn't validating emails correctly\"\n\nGremlins investigates before fixing: reproduce → find root cause → write failing test → fix → verify.\n\n**Shipping work:**\n> \"I think this feature is done\"\n\nGremlins verifies before claiming success: runs tests, checks the diff, reviews against the original plan.\n\n### The Plans Folder\n\nGremlins tracks work in a `plans/` directory:\n\n```\nplans/\n├── active/           # Work in progress\n│   └── {plan-name}/\n│       ├── design/         # Problem analysis, approach, decisions\n│       └── implementation/ # Step-by-step execution plans\n├── complete/         # Finished work (for reference)\n└── archive/          # Abandoned or obsolete plans\n```\n\nThis gives you a paper trail of what was built and why.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add brmatola/gremlins\n/plugin install gremlins@gremlins\n```\n\nStart a conversation and describe what you want to do.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThese workflows encode disciplined engineering practices:\n\n- **Understand before acting** - Investigate root causes, don't guess\n- **Test first** - Write the test, watch it fail, then implement\n- **Verify before claiming** - Run the command, see the output, then claim success\n- **Ground in reality** - Research the codebase before designing\n\nThe workflows resist rationalization - they counter common excuses for skipping important steps.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nGremlins adapts content from:\n\n- [Obra Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent\n- [ed3d-plugins](https://github.com/ed3d/ed3d-plugins) by Ed DeGagne\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n"
