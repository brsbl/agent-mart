        "README.md": "# GitHub Development Flow Plugins\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins for GitHub driven code development workflow.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository contains plugins designed to streamline development workflows that center around GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. These plugins help bridge the gap between issue tracking and implementation by automating planning, documentation, and code review processes.\n\n## Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| [github-devflow](./github-devflow) | Plan and implement GitHub issues with structured workflows for issue-driven development |\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use these plugins with Claude Code, add this repository as a plugin marketplace.\n\nFrom within Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add hhiroshell/gh-devflow-plugins\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from the marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin install github-devflow@gh-devflow-plugins\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n### `/github-devflow:plan <issue-number>`\n\nAnalyzes a GitHub issue and the codebase to generate a structured implementation plan. The plan includes affected files, step-by-step implementation guidance, testing approach, and potential risks. The plan is automatically posted as a comment on the issue for review.\n\n### `/github-devflow:implement <issue-number>`\n\nImplements a GitHub issue by reading the implementation plan from the issue comments, writing the code, and creating a pull request. Automatically links the PR to the issue and adds appropriate labels.\n\n### `/github-devflow:code-review <pr-number>`\n\nPerforms a comprehensive multi-perspective code review of a pull request. Dispatches 8 specialized reviewer agents in parallel (logic, design, security, performance, convention compliance, git history, PR history, documentation), each analyzing with a clean context. Aggregates all findings into a single GitHub PR review with line-specific comments and a summary.\n\n### `/github-devflow:reply <pr-number>`\n\nReplies to unresolved review threads on a pull request. Fetches threads where the latest comment was not generated by Claude Code, analyzes comments with full codebase context, and posts thoughtful replies addressing reviewer concerns.\n\n### `/github-devflow:fix <pr-number>`\n\nProcesses unresolved PR review threads by autonomously deciding and executing the appropriate action for each: fixing the code (with auto-commit), creating a GitHub issue for out-of-scope problems, or dismissing minor suggestions. Replies to each thread reporting the action taken, then pushes all commits.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\n1. **Plan**: Use `/github-devflow:plan <number>` to analyze an issue and generate an implementation plan\n2. **Review**: Review and refine the plan on GitHub\n3. **Implement**: Use `/github-devflow:implement <number>` to implement the plan and create a PR\n4. **Code Review**: Use `/github-devflow:code-review <pr-number>` to get a multi-perspective code review\n5. **Reply**: Use `/github-devflow:reply <pr-number>` to respond to PR review comments\n6. **Fix**: Use `/github-devflow:fix <pr-number>` to fix code, create issues, or dismiss review comments\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed\n- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated\n- Must be run from within a git repository linked to GitHub\n\n## Philosophy\n\nGitHub driven development treats GitHub Issues as the source of truth for requirements and Pull Requests as the primary unit of work. These plugins support this workflow by:\n\n- **Planning**: Analyzing issues and generating implementation plans before coding\n- **Documentation**: Keeping discussions and decisions in GitHub where they belong\n- **Automation**: Reducing manual steps between planning and implementation\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "github-devflow/README.md": "# GitHub DevFlow\n\nA Claude Code plugin for GitHub issue-driven development workflows. Plan and implement GitHub issues with structured workflows.\n\n## Features\n\n### Planning (`/plan`)\n\n- Fetches GitHub issue details using `gh` CLI\n- Analyzes your codebase to create context-aware implementation plans\n- Generates structured plans with:\n  - Overview and approach\n  - Affected files\n  - Implementation steps\n  - Testing approach\n  - Potential risks\n- Posts the plan directly as an issue comment for review on GitHub\n\n### Implementation (`/implement`)\n\n- **Fetch Implementation Plans**: Reads implementation plans from GitHub issue descriptions, comments, and replies\n- **Automated Implementation**: Implements code changes following the plan\n- **PR Creation**: Creates a pull request with proper linking to the issue\n- **Issue Updates**: Comments on the issue with PR link and adds status label\n\n### Multi-Perspective Code Review (`/code-review`)\n\n- Reviews a PR from 8 different perspectives using specialized agents in parallel\n- **Logic & Correctness**: Bugs, edge cases, error handling, race conditions\n- **Design & Maintainability**: Code structure, naming, SOLID principles\n- **Security**: Injection, auth issues, data exposure, OWASP concerns\n- **Performance**: Algorithmic complexity, memory usage, N+1 queries\n- **Convention Compliance**: CLAUDE.md and project convention adherence\n- **Git History Context**: Git blame analysis, regression risk from commit history\n- **PR History Context**: Past PR review comments and decisions on same files\n- **Documentation**: Missing or outdated docs for changed code\n- Aggregates all findings into a single GitHub PR review with line-specific comments\n\n### Reply to PR Comments (`/reply`)\n\n- Fetches unresolved review threads from a pull request\n- Filters threads where the latest comment is from another user\n- Analyzes comments with full codebase context\n- Generates thoughtful replies addressing reviewer concerns\n- Posts replies directly to the PR threads\n\n### Fix PR Review Comments (`/fix`)\n\n- Fetches unresolved review threads from a pull request\n- Analyzes each thread and autonomously decides the appropriate action:\n  - **Fix**: Makes code changes to address the concern and auto-commits\n  - **New Issue**: Creates a GitHub issue to track the problem for later\n  - **Won't Fix**: Skips threads that are minor suggestions or already addressed\n- Replies to each thread reporting the action taken\n- Pushes all commits and provides a summary of actions\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated\n- Git configured with push access to the repository\n- Must be run from within a git repository linked to GitHub\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin install github-devflow@gh-devflow-plugins\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Plan an Issue\n\n```\n/plan <issue-number>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/plan 123\n```\n\nThis will analyze issue #123, explore the codebase, generate an implementation plan, and post it as a comment on the issue.\n\n### Implement an Issue\n\n```\n/implement <issue-number>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/implement 123\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch issue #123 and extract the implementation plan\n2. Create a branch `issue-123`\n3. Implement the changes based on the plan\n4. Create a PR linked to the issue\n5. Comment on the issue with the PR link\n6. Add `implementation-started` label to the issue\n\n### Review a PR\n\n```\n/code-review <pr-number>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/code-review 456\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch the PR diff and metadata\n2. Dispatch 8 specialized reviewer agents in parallel (logic, design, security, performance, convention, git history, PR history, documentation)\n3. Aggregate all findings into a single review\n4. Post the review to GitHub with line-specific comments and a summary\n\n### Reply to PR Comments\n\n```\n/reply <pr-number>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/reply 456\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch all review threads from PR #456\n2. Filter for unresolved threads or threads where the latest comment is from another user\n3. Analyze each comment with codebase context\n4. Generate and post thoughtful replies to each thread\n\n### Fix PR Review Comments\n\n```\n/fix <pr-number>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/fix 456\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Fetch unresolved review threads from PR #456\n2. Analyze each thread and decide whether to fix, create an issue, or skip\n3. Make code changes and commit each fix individually\n4. Create GitHub issues for problems that need separate tracking\n5. Reply to each thread with the action taken\n6. Push all commits to the remote branch\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\n1. **Plan**: Use `/plan <number>` to analyze an issue and generate an implementation plan\n2. **Review**: Review and refine the plan on GitHub\n3. **Implement**: Use `/implement <number>` to implement the plan and create a PR\n4. **Code Review**: Use `/code-review <pr-number>` to get a multi-perspective code review\n5. **Reply**: Use `/reply <pr-number>` to respond to PR review comments\n6. **Fix**: Use `/fix <pr-number>` to fix code, create issues, or dismiss review comments\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/plan` | Create and post an implementation plan for a GitHub issue |\n| `/implement` | Implement a GitHub issue following the plan and create a PR |\n| `/code-review` | Multi-perspective code review of a PR using 8 specialized agents |\n| `/reply` | Reply to unresolved review threads on a pull request |\n| `/fix` | Fix code, create issues, or dismiss PR review comments |\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"gh CLI requires authentication\"\n\nRun `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub.\n\n### \"No implementation plan found\"\n\nThe `/implement` skill looks for implementation plans in the issue body and comments. Use `/plan` first to create a structured plan.\n\n### \"Cannot create label\"\n\nYou may not have permission to create labels in the repository. The implementation will continue without the label.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
