        "README.md": "# RPA - Research, Plan, Act\n\nA collection of Claude Code slash commands for structured software development workflows. These commands help you systematically research codebases, create implementation plans, and execute them with proper verification.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThe RPA workflow encourages a methodical approach to software development:\n\n1. **Research** - Understand the codebase before making changes\n2. **Plan** - Create detailed, phased implementation plans with clear success criteria\n3. **Act** - Implement the plan with continuous verification\n\nThis approach reduces errors, improves code quality, and creates documentation that helps with future maintenance.\n\n## Commands Overview\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/research_codebase` | Document and explain the codebase as it exists |\n| `/create_plan` | Create detailed implementation plans through interactive iteration |\n| `/implement_plan` | Execute approved plans with verification at each phase |\n| `/iterate_plan` | Update existing plans based on feedback |\n| `/enhance_plan` | Synthesize multiple opinions into plan improvements |\n| `/enhance_research` | Improve research documents with additional findings |\n| `/validate_plan` | Verify that a plan was correctly implemented |\n| `/create_handoff` | Create handoff documents to transfer work between sessions |\n| `/resume_handoff` | Resume work from a handoff document |\n| `/tech_debt_sweep` | Scan codebase for technical debt and generate paydown plan |\n| `/tech_debt_trends` | Analyze technical debt trends over time |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Install (Recommended)\n\nCopy commands, agents, and scripts to your global Claude configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Create directories if they don't exist\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/commands\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/agents\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/scripts\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks\n\n# Copy commands\ncp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/\n\n# Copy agents (enables parallel sub-agents)\ncp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/\n\n# Copy and make scripts executable\ncp scripts/*.sh ~/.claude/scripts/\nchmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/*.sh\n\n# Optional: Copy hooks for deterministic quality gates\ncp hooks/*.json ~/.claude/hooks/\n```\n\n### Plugin Install (Alternative)\n\nInstall as a Claude Code plugin (adds `rpa:` prefix to commands):\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dsmolchanov/rpa.git\nclaude plugin install --plugin-dir ./rpa\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, start Claude Code and check that commands are available:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, these commands should now be available\n/research_codebase\n/create_plan\n/implement_plan\n```\n\n## Directory Structure\n\nAfter installation, your `~/.claude/` directory should look like:\n\n```\n~/.claude/\n├── commands/\n│   ├── research_codebase.md\n│   ├── create_plan.md\n│   ├── implement_plan.md\n│   ├── iterate_plan.md\n│   ├── enhance_plan.md\n│   ├── enhance_research.md\n│   ├── validate_plan.md\n│   ├── create_handoff.md\n│   ├── resume_handoff.md\n│   ├── tech_debt_sweep.md     # NEW\n│   └── tech_debt_trends.md    # NEW\n├── agents/                     # NEW SECTION\n│   ├── code-analyzer.md\n│   ├── codebase-analyzer.md\n│   ├── codebase-locator.md\n│   ├── codebase-pattern-finder.md\n│   ├── file-analyzer.md\n│   ├── parallel-worker.md\n│   ├── test-runner.md\n│   ├── thoughts-analyzer.md\n│   ├── thoughts-locator.md\n│   ├── web-search-researcher.md\n│   ├── dependency-auditor.md   # NEW\n│   ├── debt-scanner.md         # NEW\n│   ├── architecture-guard.md   # NEW\n│   ├── docs-auditor.md         # NEW\n│   └── config-auditor.md       # NEW\n├── scripts/\n│   └── spec_metadata.sh\n└── hooks/                      # NEW SECTION\n    └── tech-debt-hooks.md\n```\n\n## Project Setup\n\nFor each project using RPA, create a `thoughts/` directory structure:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p thoughts/shared/{research,plans,implementations,handoffs,debt}\n```\n\nThis creates:\n- `thoughts/shared/research/` - Research documents\n- `thoughts/shared/plans/` - Implementation plans\n- `thoughts/shared/implementations/` - Validation reports\n- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/` - Session handoff documents\n- `thoughts/shared/debt/` - Technical debt reports and paydown plans\n\n**Important**: Ensure `thoughts/shared/debt/` is tracked in git (not in `.gitignore`) for trend analysis to work.\n\n## Technical Debt Management\n\nThe repo includes commands for periodic technical debt reduction.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nTech debt work follows the same RPA pattern as feature work:\n1. **Research** (scan) - Discover what debt exists\n2. **Plan** (prioritize) - Create actionable paydown plan\n3. **Act** (apply) - Fix safe issues, plan larger refactors\n\n### /tech_debt_sweep\n\nPerforms a comprehensive technical debt scan and generates actionable artifacts.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n/tech_debt_sweep        # Scan and generate report + plan\n/tech_debt_sweep apply  # Auto-fix safe issues\n```\n\n**What it scans:**\n- Dependencies (security, outdated, unused)\n- Code debt markers (TODO/FIXME, lint suppressions)\n- Architecture (boundaries, cycles, god modules)\n- Documentation (README accuracy, docstrings)\n- Configuration (hardcoded values, credentials)\n\n**Output:**\n- `thoughts/shared/debt/YYYY-MM-DD-tech-debt-sweep.md` - Debt report\n- `thoughts/shared/debt/YYYY-MM-DD-tech-debt-paydown.md` - Paydown plan\n\n### /tech_debt_trends\n\nAnalyzes debt trajectory by comparing historical sweep reports.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n/tech_debt_trends      # Analyze last 4 weeks\n/tech_debt_trends 8    # Analyze last 8 weeks\n```\n\n**Requires:** At least 2 previous debt sweeps\n\n### New Agents\n\nThese specialized agents support the debt sweep:\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `dependency-auditor` | Security vulnerabilities, outdated packages |\n| `debt-scanner` | TODO/FIXME, lint suppressions, complexity |\n| `architecture-guard` | Boundary violations, circular deps |\n| `docs-auditor` | README accuracy, docstring coverage |\n| `config-auditor` | Hardcoded values, credential detection |\n\n### Recommended Schedule\n\n- **Weekly**: Run `/tech_debt_sweep` every Friday\n- **After sweep**: Review plan, run `/tech_debt_sweep apply`\n- **Monthly**: Run `/tech_debt_trends` to track progress\n\n### Hooks for Deterministic Quality\n\nInstall the hooks pack for automatic quality gates:\n\n```bash\ncp hooks/*.md ~/.claude/hooks/\n```\n\nThis ensures:\n- Files are auto-formatted after edits\n- Lint runs when Claude finishes responding\n- Related tests run after code changes\n\n### Whitelist for False Positives\n\nCreate `thoughts/shared/debt/.whitelist` to exclude files/patterns from scans:\n\n```\n# Exclude intentionally hardcoded config\nsrc/config/defaults.ts\n\n# Exclude legacy code that's being replaced\nlegacy/**\n\n# Exclude specific TODO that's deferred\nsrc/api/client.ts:45\n```\n\nAgents will check this file and skip whitelisted items.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Research a Codebase\n\n```\n/research_codebase\n> How does the authentication system work?\n```\n\nThe command will:\n1. Spawn parallel agents to explore the codebase\n2. Find relevant files and patterns\n3. Create a research document at `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-authentication-flow.md`\n\n### Create an Implementation Plan\n\n```\n/create_plan\n> Add rate limiting to the API endpoints\n```\n\nThe command will:\n1. Research existing patterns in your codebase\n2. Ask clarifying questions\n3. Create a phased implementation plan\n4. Save it to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-rate-limiting.md`\n\n### Implement a Plan\n\n```\n/implement_plan thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-15-rate-limiting.md\n```\n\nThe command will:\n1. Read the plan and understand each phase\n2. Implement changes for each phase\n3. Run automated verification\n4. Pause for manual verification before continuing\n5. Update checkboxes in the plan as work completes\n\n### Validate Implementation\n\n```\n/validate_plan thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-15-rate-limiting.md\n```\n\nThe command will:\n1. Compare actual changes against the plan\n2. Run all verification commands\n3. Generate a validation report\n4. List any deviations or issues found\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Research Phase\n- Always research before planning\n- Document what EXISTS, not what SHOULD BE\n- Include file:line references for easy navigation\n- Create research documents for future reference\n\n### Planning Phase\n- Break work into small, testable phases\n- Include both automated AND manual success criteria\n- Define what's NOT in scope to prevent creep\n- Get feedback on structure before writing details\n\n### Implementation Phase\n- Follow the plan's intent, adapt when reality differs\n- Run verification after each phase\n- Update plan checkboxes as you complete work\n- Pause for manual verification before proceeding\n\n### Handoffs\n- Create handoffs at end of sessions or before context switches\n- Include learnings and gotchas discovered\n- Reference specific file:line for recent changes\n- List explicit next steps for the resuming agent\n\n## Command Details\n\n### /research_codebase\n\nCreates documentation of how the codebase currently works. Uses parallel agents to explore efficiently.\n\n**Key principles:**\n- Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE\n- No recommendations unless explicitly asked\n- Include specific file:line references\n- Save research for future reference\n\n### /create_plan\n\nInteractive command that creates detailed implementation plans.\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Read any referenced files\n2. Research the codebase\n3. Present understanding and ask questions\n4. Propose plan structure\n5. Write detailed plan with success criteria\n6. Iterate based on feedback\n\n### /implement_plan\n\nExecutes an approved implementation plan.\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Read plan and identify starting point\n2. Implement each phase\n3. Run automated verification\n4. Pause for manual verification\n5. Continue to next phase\n\n### /validate_plan\n\nVerifies that an implementation matches its plan.\n\n**Checks:**\n- All phases marked complete are actually done\n- Automated verification passes\n- Code follows existing patterns\n- No regressions introduced\n\n## Customization\n\n### Adding Custom Commands\n\nCreate new `.md` files in `~/.claude/commands/` following the existing patterns. Commands can:\n- Specify a preferred model with `model: opus` in frontmatter\n- Include step-by-step instructions\n- Reference other commands\n- Use sub-agents for parallel work\n\n### Modifying Existing Commands\n\nEdit the command files directly. Key sections to customize:\n- Initial response and prompts\n- Success criteria templates\n- Document output formats\n- Directory paths for your project structure\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Commands not appearing\n\n1. Check files are in `~/.claude/commands/`\n2. Verify file extension is `.md`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\n### Scripts not running\n\n1. Check scripts are in `~/.claude/scripts/`\n2. Verify executable permissions: `chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/*.sh`\n3. Test script directly: `~/.claude/scripts/spec_metadata.sh`\n\n### thoughts/ directory issues\n\n1. Create the directory structure manually:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p thoughts/shared/{research,plans,implementations,handoffs}\n   ```\n2. Add to `.gitignore` if you don't want to commit these files\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - feel free to use, modify, and share these commands.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! Please:\n1.
