        "README.md": "# ODD - Outcomes-Driven Development Plugin for Claude Code\n\nA Claude Code plugin that provides governance tools for human-AI collaboration based on the **Outcomes-Driven Development (ODD)** framework.\n\n## What is ODD?\n\nOutcomes-Driven Development is a governance framework that prioritizes real-world results over artifacts. The core thesis:\n\n> Development is about defining outcomes, enforcing constraints, and verifying reality—not writing code. AI accelerates execution; governance preserves trust.\n\n### The 7 Pillars\n\n1. **Prompt over Code** - Intent guides generation; code is ephemeral\n2. **KISS** - Simplicity is non-negotiable\n3. **DRY with Isolation** - Reuse without brittle coupling\n4. **Consistency** - Behavioral predictability matters\n5. **Maintainability** - Systems must survive creator turnover\n6. **Antifragile** - Recovery paths preferred over prevention\n7. **Scalable** - Growth bounded in cost, complexity, and attention\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code version **1.0.33 or later**\n\n### From GitHub\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add unfoldingWord/odd-claude-plugin\n\n# Step 2: Install the plugin\n/plugin install odd-claude-plugin@unfoldingWord\n```\n\nFor project-wide installation (shared with collaborators via `.claude/settings.json`):\n\n```bash\n/plugin install odd-claude-plugin@unfoldingWord --scope project\n```\n\n### Local Development\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/unfoldingWord/odd-claude-plugin.git\n\n# Add as local marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add ./odd-claude-plugin\n\n# Install (use the plugin name from plugin.json)\n/plugin install odd@odd-claude-plugin\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nRun `/plugin` and check the \"Installed\" tab to confirm the plugin is active.\n\n## Available Commands\n\n### `/odd-init`\nInitialize ODD governance in your project. Provides guidance on:\n- The ODD framework and 7 pillars\n- **Core terminology** (Outcome, Evidence, Artifact, Canon, Attempt, Lane)\n- **Document tiers** (Tier 0-3 epistemic obligation levels)\n- Project maturity levels (PoC → Pilot → Production)\n- Recommended folder structure\n\n### `/self-audit`\nRun through the 9-area self-audit checklist before declaring work complete:\n1. Intended Outcome\n2. Constraints Applied\n3. Decision Rules Followed\n4. Verification Performed\n5. Evidence Produced\n6. UX & Behavior Check\n7. Tradeoffs & Risks\n8. Maintainability Check\n9. Confidence Level\n\n### `/dod`\nCheck if work meets the ODD Definition of Done requirements:\n1. Change Description - What changed, where, and why\n2. Verification Performed - What was run or checked\n3. Observed Behavior - What actually happened\n4. Evidence Produced - Proof of behavior\n5. Self-Audit Completed - Reflection against constraints\n\n### `/create-prd`\nInteractive PRD (Product Requirements Document) creation with:\n- **PRD Type Classification** (PoC, Feature, Fix, Product slice, Refactor)\n- **Asset Intake** (inventory existing docs, media, links)\n- **7-Stage Elicitation**:\n  1. Outcome Discovery\n  2. Success Criteria\n  3. Non-Goals and Scope\n  4. Constraints\n  5. Definition of Done\n  6. Risks and Tradeoffs\n  7. Draft Assembly\n\n### `/constraints`\nReview and apply the 10 ODD constraints:\n1. Offline-First (Default)\n2. Long Timelines & Changing Ownership\n3. Maintainability Over Cleverness\n4. Interoperability Over Feature Completeness\n5. Stateless or Low-State by Default\n6. AI as Accelerator, Not Authority\n7. Evidence Over Assertion\n8. UX Is Contextual, Not Universal\n9. Ephemeral Artifacts Are Acceptable\n10. Explicit Tradeoffs\n\n### `/decision-rules`\nGet guidance from the 14 ODD decision heuristics when facing choices:\n- Outcomes Before Implementation\n- Borrow → Bend → Break → Build\n- Simplicity Wins (KISS)\n- DRY with Isolation\n- And 10 more...\n\n## Agents\n\n### PRD Guide Agent\nA dedicated PRD elicitation agent for thorough, multi-turn PRD creation. Key principle: **\"You extract. You do not invent.\"**\n\nFeatures:\n- PRD type classification and asset intake\n- Terminology precision enforcement\n- Probing questions at each stage\n- Push-back on vague or untestable statements\n- Comprehensive PRD assembly\n\n## Progressive Governance\n\nODD applies different levels of rigor based on project maturity:\n\n| Level | Stage | Governance |\n|-------|-------|------------|\n| 0 | PoC / Exploration | Bias toward speed; over-governance prohibited |\n| 1 | Pilot / Product | Evidence required; tradeoffs explicit |\n| 2 | Production | Outcomes measurable; security mandatory |\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Evidence Over Assertion\n> Work is not complete unless it is verified with evidence. Assertions like \"this should work\" do not count.\n\n### Restartability Over Salvage\n> Clean restarts with better constraints are progress. Restarting is not failure.\n\n### Memory Is the Bottleneck\n> In AI-accelerated development, durable intent is scarce—not computation.\n\n## Core Terminology\n\nODD uses precise vocabulary:\n\n| Term | ODD Meaning | NOT |\n|------|-------------|-----|\n| **Outcome** | Verifiable state that can be demonstrated | Feature, artifact, checkbox |\n| **Evidence** | Observable proof (reproducible/recorded) | Confidence, assertion |\n| **Artifact** | Byproduct of work. Ephemeral by default | The goal or proof of value |\n| **Canon** | Curated truths earned through verification | Wiki or documentation dump |\n| **Attempt** | Bounded execution with evidence captured | Vague \"try\" or experiment |\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull ODD documentation is available in `docs/prd-guide-pack.md` (v1.4.1), including:\n- Core terminology and document tiers\n- Complete constraints definitions\n- All 14 decision rules with examples\n- Definition of Done requirements\n- Self-audit checklist details\n- PRD template and creation guide\n\n## Future Ideas\n\nSee `docs/future-ideas.md` for planned enhancements including:\n- File creation in `/odd-init`\n- Evidence capture helpers\n- Maturity level tracking\n- Code review integration\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! When contributing, please:\n1. Follow ODD principles (evidence over assertion)\n2. Include verification of changes\n3. Document tradeoffs explicitly\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n---\n\n> ODD is about preserving intent without freezing execution. The measure of success is not how elegant the artifact is, but whether the outcome holds up in the real world.\n"
