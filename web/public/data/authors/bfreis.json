Create the plugin directory structure\n\n```\nplugins/your-plugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json\n└── ... (skills, commands, agents, etc.)\n```\n\n### 2. Create the plugin manifest (`plugins/your-plugin-name/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)\n\nThis file contains metadata about the installed plugin, shown in the **Manage Plugins** interface and `/help` output.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-plugin-name\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"Brief summary of what the plugin does\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"Your Name\",\n    \"email\": \"you@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"skills\": [\"./skills/skill-name.md\"],\n  \"commands\": [\"./commands/command-name.md\"],\n  \"agents\": [\"./agents/agent-name.md\"]\n}\n```\n\n| Field | Required | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| `name` | Yes | Plugin identifier (kebab-case) |\n| `version` | Yes | Semantic version |\n| `description` | Yes | Brief summary shown to users who have the plugin installed |\n| `author` | Yes | Object with `name`, `email`, and optionally `url` |\n| `skills`, `commands`, `agents`, `hooks`, `mcpServers` | No | Relative paths (starting with `./`) to component files |\n\n### 3. Register the plugin in marketplace.json (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)\n\nAdd an entry to the `plugins` array. This description is shown in the **Browse Plugins** interface when users discover new plugins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"your-plugin-name\",\n      \"source\": \"./plugins/your-plugin-name\",\n      \"description\": \"Detailed description for plugin discovery. Explain what the plugin does, its benefits, and use cases to help users decide whether to install it.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n| Field | Required | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| `name` | Yes | Must match the plugin's `plugin.json` name |\n| `source` | Yes | Relative path to the plugin directory |\n| `description` | No | Detailed description for browsing/discovery (can be longer than plugin.json's) |\n| `category`, `tags` | No | Optional marketplace-specific metadata for organization |\n\n### Description field differences\n\nThe two description fields serve different purposes:\n\n- **marketplace.json description**: Shown when users browse available plugins (`/plugin` → Browse). Use a detailed, promotional description to help users understand the value before installing.\n\n- **plugin.json description**: Shown after installation in the management interface and `/help`. Use a brief summary of what the plugin does.\n\n## Versioning Policy\n\nThis marketplace follows **strict semantic versioning**. Plugin authors must bump the version number in `plugin.json` for every change that users should receive.\n\n### Why version bumps are required\n\nThe Claude Code plugin update mechanism may not automatically detect code changes without a version bump. To ensure users receive updates reliably:\n\n1. **Always bump the version** when pushing changes to a plugin\n2. **Never push code changes without a version bump** — users may not receive the update\n3. **Use semantic versioning** to communicate the nature of changes\n\n### Semantic versioning rules\n\n| Change type | Version bump | Example |\n|-------------|--------------|---------|\n| Bug fixes, minor tweaks | Patch | `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` |\n| New features, backward-compatible | Minor | `1.0.1` → `1.1.0` |\n| Breaking changes | Major | `1.1.0` → `2.0.0` |\n\n### What counts as a breaking change?\n\n- Removing or renaming skills, commands, or agents\n- Changing behavior that users depend on\n- Requiring new permissions or dependencies\n\n### Version consistency\n\nTwo users with the same version number should always have identical plugin behavior. This means:\n\n- Don't push multiple commits under the same version\n- If you find a bug right after releasing, bump to a new patch version rather than amending\n- Treat each version as immutable once pushed\n",
        "plugins/plan-exec/README.md": "# Plan Exec Plugin\n\nA Claude Code plugin that creates self-updating plan files for autonomous, phased project execution with comprehensive implementation tracking.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin provides two complementary skills for project planning and execution:\n\n### plan-generator\n\nCreates feature-specific project plans (e.g., `PLAN-auth.md`, `PLAN-api.md`) broken down into phases and detailed steps. Use this skill when you need to plan a new feature or project.\n\n### plan-executor\n\nExecutes existing plan files autonomously. Use this skill when you have a PLAN file and want to start or continue working through it. The executor handles:\n\n- Working through phases and steps systematically\n- Tracking progress via JSON state block and `plan-update` commands\n- Documenting implementation decisions and findings\n- Resuming work seamlessly across sessions\n- Delegating work to sub-agents (worker mode) to reduce context usage\n\n## Installation\n\n### For Personal Use\n\n1. Copy this plugin to your Claude Code plugins directory:\n   ```bash\n   cp -r plugins/plan-exec ~/.claude/plugins/\n   ```\n\n2. The skills will be automatically available in all your Claude Code sessions\n\n### For Team/Project Use\n\n1. Add this plugin configuration to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"plugins\": [\n       {\n         \"path\": \"./plugins/plan-exec\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Commit the plugin to your repository\n3. Team members will have the skills available when they trust the project folder\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating a Plan\n\nUse the **plan-generator** skill to create a new plan. Simply describe your project to Claude Code:\n\n```\nCreate a plan for building a JWT authentication system with refresh tokens\n```\n\nClaude will suggest a filename like `PLAN-auth.md` or ask you to choose one. You can also explicitly request it:\n\n```\nUse the plan generator to create a plan for [your project description]\n```\n\n### Executing a Plan\n\nUse the **plan-executor** skill to work through an existing plan:\n\n```\nExecute PLAN-auth.md\n```\n\nOr simply reference the plan file and ask to continue:\n\n```\n@PLAN-auth.md - Continue working on this plan\n```\n\nThe executor will read the plan, identify the current phase and next steps, and begin autonomous execution.\n\n### Plan File Naming\n\nPlans can be named flexibly to support multiple features in one repository:\n- Feature-specific: `PLAN-auth.md`, `PLAN-api.md`, `PLAN-frontend.md`\n- Main project: `PLAN.md`\n- Custom: `PLAN-{your-feature}.md`\n\n### Resuming Work\n\nReference a plan file in any session to resume work:\n\n```\n@PLAN-auth.md\n```\n\nClaude Code will read the plan, understand the project context, implementation notes, and resume work from where it left off using the plan-executor skill.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- Claude will work autonomously through entire phases\n- Progress is tracked in a JSON state block at the end of the plan file\n- Claude uses `plan-update` commands to mark steps as started, completed, or blocked\n- Implementation notes are added as sub-bullets under completed steps\n- Detailed findings are documented in the \"Notes & Decisions\" section\n- Claude only stops when a phase completes (unless auto-continue is enabled) or errors occur\n- With auto-continue enabled, Claude will proceed through all phases without stopping\n- You can resume work across multiple sessions by referencing the plan file\n- Use `/plan-status` to check current progress at any time\n\n## Plan File Structure\n\nGenerated plans include (in this order):\n\n1. **Instructions for Claude** (TOP - most critical): Complete autonomous execution guidelines\n2. **Current Phase**: Simple status indicator showing current phase or \"COMPLETE\"\n3. **Project Overview**: Goal, context, and requirements\n4. **Phase Breakdown**: Detailed phases with steps using `### Step N.X:` headings\n5. **Notes & Decisions**: Comprehensive implementation notes for each phase documenting:\n   - Implementation details and approach\n   - Decisions made and why\n   - Deviations from plan\n   - Technical findings\n   - Test results\n6. **Dependencies**: Required packages/tools\n7. **Completion Checklist**: Final project readiness criteria\n8. **JSON State Block**: Machine-readable progress tracking (at the end of the file)\n\nThe JSON state block is wrapped in HTML comment markers (`<!--PLAN-STATE ... PLAN-STATE-->`) so it doesn't render visually but is easily parsed by tools. It contains:\n- Execution settings (mode, auto-continue, commit options)\n- Current phase index\n- Per-phase step status (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)\n- Summaries and blocker reasons\n\n## Progress Tracking\n\nPlans use a JSON state block to track progress. The `plan-update` command is available at runtime to manage plan state.\n\n### Status Values\n\n- **pending** - Step not yet started\n- **in_progress** - Currently being worked on (only one step at a time)\n- **completed** - Step finished successfully\n- **blocked** - Cannot proceed without resolution\n\n### plan-update Commands\n\n```bash\n# Mark a step as in-progress (resets any other in-progress step)\nplan-update start <file> <step-id>\n\n# Mark a step as completed (optionally with a summary)\nplan-update complete <file> <step-id> [--summary \"Implementation details...\"]\n\n# Mark a step as blocked (reason required)\nplan-update block <file> <step-id> --reason \"Waiting for API credentials\"\n\n# Clear blocked status, return to pending\nplan-update unblock <file> <step-id>\n\n# Advance to next phase (fails if steps incomplete unless --force)\nplan-update next-phase <file> [--force]\n\n# Initialize JSON state for an existing plan\nplan-update init <file> [--mode direct|worker] [--auto-continue] [--commit]\n```\n\n### Checking Status\n\nUse the `/plan-status` command to see current progress:\n\n```\n/plan-status PLAN-auth.md\n```\n\nThis displays:\n- Current phase and overall progress\n- Per-phase completion counts\n- Any in-progress or blocked steps\n- Execution settings (mode, auto-continue, commits)\n\n**Note:** During normal execution, Claude runs these commands automatically. You typically only need them for debugging or manual intervention.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n### Single Feature Plan\n\n1. **Initial planning**:\n   ```\n   Create a plan for building a JWT authentication system\n   ```\n\n2. **Start execution**:\n   ```\n   @PLAN-auth.md - Let's begin Phase 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Check progress** at any time:\n   ```\n   /plan-status PLAN-auth.md\n   ```\n\n4. **Resume later** (even weeks later):\n   ```\n   @PLAN-auth.md - Continue where we left off\n   ```\n\n### Behind the Scenes\n\nWhen Claude executes steps, it automatically runs `plan-update` commands:\n\n```bash\n# Starting a step\nplan-update start PLAN-auth.md 1.2\n\n# Completing a step with notes\nplan-update complete PLAN-auth.md 1.2 --summary \"Created JWT middleware with RS256\"\n\n# If something blocks progress\nplan-update block PLAN-auth.md 1.3 --reason \"Redis not configured\"\n```\n\nYou typically don't need to run these manually - Claude handles it automatically.\n\n### Multiple Plans in One Repository\n\nYou can maintain multiple plans for different features:\n```\n@PLAN-auth.md - Work on authentication\n@PLAN-api.md - Work on API endpoints\n@PLAN-frontend.md - Work on UI components\n```\n\nEach plan operates independently with its own JSON state block and progress tracking.\n\n## Execution Modes\n\nPlans can run in two execution modes, chosen during plan creation:\n\n### Direct Mode (Default)\n\n- Steps are executed directly in the main Claude Code session\n- Best for: Small plans, simple tasks, exploratory work\n- Trade-off: Full continuity between steps, but higher context usage\n\n### Worker Mode\n\n- Steps are delegated to `plan-worker` sub-agents\n- Each worker runs in an isolated context window\n- Best for: Large plans, multi-phase projects, context-heavy work\n- Trade-off: Lower context usage in main session, enabling longer autonomous runs\n\n**How Worker Mode Works:**\n\n1. The main session acts as a **coordinator**\n2. Coordinator identifies the next batch of steps to execute\n3. Coordinator launches a worker sub-agent with:\n   - Project context and goal\n   - Specific steps to execute\n   - Relevant files to read/modify\n   - Success criteria\n4. Worker executes steps in isolated context\n5. Worker returns a structured summary\n6. Coordinator updates the plan with results and continues\n\n**Worker summaries appear as inline notes under the step heading:**\n```markdown\n### Step 2.1: Add JWT generation function\n\n- **Worker:** Created jwt.ts with sign/verify, uses RS256\n- Decision: RS256 for public key verification support\n```\n\n**When to use Worker Mode:**\n- Plans with 3+ phases\n- Steps involving extensive file reading/editing\n- Long-running autonomous work sessions\n- When you've experienced context exhaustion in the past\n\n## Auto-Continue Mode\n\nBy default, Claude stops at the end of each phase to ask if you want to continue. You can enable **auto-continue** during plan creation to have Claude automatically proceed to the next phase without stopping.\n\n**With auto-continue enabled:**\n- Claude executes all phases sequentially without asking for confirmation\n- Only stops when all phases are complete, a blocker occurs, or you explicitly request a pause\n- Ideal for fully autonomous, unattended execution\n\n**With auto-continue disabled (default):**\n- Claude stops at the end of each phase\n- Asks for confirmation before starting the next phase\n- Gives you natural checkpoints to review progress, make adjustments, or pause\n\n**When to enable auto-continue:**\n- You trust the plan is well-defined and complete\n- You want fully unattended execution\n- You're running overnight or during long periods away\n\n**When to keep auto-continue disabled:**\n- You want to review progress between phases\n- The project may require adjustments as you learn more\n- You prefer more control over execution flow\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Autonomous execution**: Claude works through entire phases without constant supervision\n- **Session persistence**: Resume work seamlessly across multiple sessions, even weeks later\n- **Rich context**: Notes & Decisions section provides comprehensive implementation history\n- **Team sharing**: Share plans, progress, and implementation decisions with team members\n- **Quality improvement**: Structured approach leads to more complete, higher-quality results\n- **No lost steps**: JSON state tracking ensures nothing is forgotten\n- **Multiple features**: Support multiple independent plans in one repository\n- **Standalone plans**: Each plan file contains everything needed to understand and continue the work\n- **Reduced context usage**: Worker mode delegates to sub-agents, enabling longer autonomous runs\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can modify `skills/plan-generator/SKILL.md` to:\n\n- Adjust the number of phases/steps Claude generates\n- Change autonomous execution behavior\n- Add project-specific planning requirements\n- Customize the PLAN.md structure\n\n## Files\n\n- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Plugin manifest\n- `skills/plan-generator/SKILL.md`: Plan creation skill\n- `skills/plan-executor/SKILL.md`: Plan execution skill\n- `agents/plan-worker.md`: Worker sub-agent definition (for worker mode)\n- `skills/plan-executor/scripts/plan-tool`: Bash script for managing plan state transitions\n- `commands/plan-status.md`: Slash command to display plan progress\n- `README.md`: This file\n\n## Author\n\nbfreis"
