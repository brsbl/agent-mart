        "README.md": "# Nullstone\n\nNullstone is a Heroku-like developer platform launched on your cloud accounts.\nWe offer a simple developer experience for teams that want to use Infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform.\n\nThis repository contains code for the Nullstone CLI which is used to manage Nullstone from the command line.\nThis includes creating and deploying app, domains, and datastore as well as creating and managing Terraform workspaces.\n\n## How to Install\n\n### Homebrew (Mac)\n\n```shell\nbrew tap nullstone-io/nullstone https://github.com/nullstone-io/nullstone.git\nbrew install nullstone\n```\n\n### Snap (Linux)\n\n[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/nullstone)\n\n### Scoop (Windows)\n\n```shell\nscoop bucket add nullstone https://github.com/nullstone-io/nullstone.git\nscoop install nullstone\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor a complete set of Nullstone documentation, visit [docs.nullstone.io](https://docs.nullstone.io). Check out the links below for specific topics within the docs.\n\n- [CLI Docs](https://docs.nullstone.io/getting-started/cli/docs.html) - \nLearn more about the Nullstone CLI; including how to install and use it.\n\n## Community & Support\n\n- [Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nullstone-io/projects/1/views/1) - View upcoming features.\n- [Discussions](https://github.com/nullstone-io/nullstone/discussions) - View product updates.\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nullstone-io/nullstone/issues) - Request new features, report bugs and errors you encounter.\n- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nullstone-community/signup) - Ask questions, get support, and hang out.\n- Email Support - support@nullstone.io\n\n## Resources\n\n- [CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/nullstone-io/nullstone-orb)\n- GitHub Action (In Development)\n- [Go API Client](https://github.com/nullstone-io/go-api-client)\n- [Nullstone Modules](https://github.com/nullstone-modules)\n\n## How it works\n\nThe Nullstone platform operates similar to a developer platform that is internally built and used at large tech companies.\nIt consists of a UI, API, and CLI to serve both software engineers and platform engineers.\nSoftware engineers use official Nullstone modules combined with modules built by their own platform engineers to launch and configure their application.\nPlatform engineers utilize the Nullstone platform to codify and administer infrastructure architectures for their teams without worrying about building user interfaces.\n\n![How it works](doc/images/how-it-works.svg)\n"
