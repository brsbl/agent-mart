However, its size and breadth can be overwhelming. This project:\n\n- **Curates essential lists** most commonly needed for security testing\n- **Organizes by category** for easy discovery and access\n- **Integrates with Claude Code** for seamless workflow integration\n- **Provides clear documentation** on when and how to use each resource\n- **Emphasizes ethical use** with clear guidelines and warnings\n\n## Source & Attribution\n\nAll security testing resources in this repository are sourced from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) by Daniel Miessler and contributors.\n\n- **Original Repository:** https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists\n- **License:** MIT License\n- **Maintainer:** Daniel Miessler\n- **Contributors:** Security community worldwide\n\nThis project is a curated, skill-packaged subset for Claude Code integration. For the complete SecLists collection (4.5GB, 6,000+ files), visit the original repository.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When Using Password Lists\n- Only test against systems you own or have written authorization to test\n- Implement rate limiting to avoid account lockouts\n- Monitor for defensive responses (WAF blocks, account locks)\n- Use appropriate delays between attempts\n\n### When Using Fuzzing Payloads\n- Test in isolated environments first\n- Validate input sanitization and output encoding\n- Check for secondary effects (logs, monitoring alerts)\n- Document all findings systematically\n\n### When Using Web Shells\n- Only use for detection system validation\n- Test in isolated lab environments\n- Never deploy on production systems\n- Focus on defensive detection capabilities\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! If you'd like to:\n\n- Add new curated wordlists\n- Improve documentation\n- Fix errors or update outdated information\n- Suggest additional skills\n\nPlease open an issue or pull request.\n\n## Documentation and References\n\n- [SecLists Official Repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)\n- [OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)\n- [Bug Bounty Platforms](https://github.com/disclose/bug-bounty-platforms)\n- [Responsible Disclosure Guidelines](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - Use responsibly with proper authorization.\n\nThis is a curated collection and redistribution of SecLists content.
