        "README.md": "# Claude Thesis Writer\n\nA Claude Code plugin for plan-driven doctoral thesis writing with Zotero-sourced citations and IEEE-style LaTeX output.\n\n## What It Does\n\nProvides a structured skill chain for thesis writing:\n\n```\ndocument-planner → writer → figure-generator → formatter → reviewer\n       ↕                                                       ↕\n zotero-research                                         zotero-research\n```\n\nAll citations come from your Zotero library. All writing follows collaboratively approved plans. Output is publication-ready LaTeX.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Claude Code** (or compatible IDE with Claude Code plugin support)\n- **Zotero** with a populated library for your research area\n- **zotero-chunk-rag MCP server** configured in Claude Code (provides `search_topic`, `search_papers`, `get_passage_context`, `get_index_stats`)\n- **LaTeX distribution** (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or similar) for compilation\n- **Python 3.10+** with matplotlib (for figure generation)\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Add the plugin marketplace in Claude Code:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/ccam80/thesis-writer\n   ```\n\n2. Install the plugin:\n   ```\n   /plugin install claude-thesis-writer\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Claude Code when prompted.\n\n4. Initialise in your thesis project:\n   ```\n   /thesis-writer:init\n   ```\n   This creates a `CLAUDE.md` with thesis writing instructions and makes all skills available.\n\n## Skills\n\n### Core Workflow\n\n| Skill | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| `zotero-research` | Spawnable research agent — topic search, claim support, citation verification |\n| `document-planner` | Multi-scope interactive planning (thesis, chapter, section, subsection) with verified references and figure stubs |\n| `writer` | LaTeX prose from plans (conversational, checks wording with user) |\n| `figure-generator` | Generates matplotlib plots and schematics from figure placeholders |\n| `formatter` | LaTeX formatting checker (packages, placement, units, cross-refs) |\n| `reviewer` | Plan compliance and reference verification |\n\n### Support\n\n| Skill | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| `peer-review` | Academic review methodology |\n| `markitdown` | File conversion (PDF → Markdown) |\n| `latex-posters` | Conference poster creation |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\n> I need to plan my background chapter on HRV physiology\n\n[document-planner runs: searches Zotero, proposes structure, iterates with you]\n\n> Approved. Now let's do detailed planning for section 2.\n\n[document-planner runs: paragraph-level planning with verified references]\n\n> Plan looks good, write it up.\n\n[writer runs: produces LaTeX prose from the approved plan]\n[figure-generator runs: creates plots from placeholders]\n[formatter runs: checks LaTeX compliance]\n[reviewer runs: verifies plan coverage and citation accuracy]\n```\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **Collaborative**: You are the domain expert. The agent organises your knowledge, never invents content.\n- **Plan-driven**: All writing follows approved plan.md files with explicit authority hierarchy.\n- **Zotero-first**: Every citation comes from your Zotero library. No external API searches.\n- **IEEE style**: Concise technical prose, numeric citations, equations with defined variables.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
