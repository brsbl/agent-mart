Review staged changes only, or commit all changes first? (staged/commit/cancel)\"\n     * Generate diff against default branch: `git diff <default-branch>...HEAD`\n     * If no changes found: Exit with message \"No changes detected between current branch and <default-branch>\"\n     * Continue with review using the local diff\n     * Skip PR metadata extraction (no PR exists yet)\n     * Use branch name and local changes for context\n   - Check if argument is a PR URL (matches pattern: `https://github.com/*/pull/*`)\n   - If PR URL detected:\n     * Use `gh pr view $URL --json headRefName,headRepository,headRepositoryOwner` to extract metadata\n     * Extract repo name and branch from JSON response\n     * **Check for existing repository:**\n       - If current directory is NOT a git repo: Check if any child folder matches repo name and contains `.git`\n       - If matching child folder found: Use that instead of cloning\n       - If no matching folder exists: Clone via `git clone git@github.com:owner/repo.git`\n     * **Navigate to repository directory**\n     * **Branch state management:**\n       1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`\n       2. Check if on HEAD of PR branch: `git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD` vs `git rev-parse origin/<pr-branch>`\n       3. Check for uncommitted changes: `git status --porcelain`\n       4. Apply appropriate action:\n          - **On PR branch, at HEAD, no changes:** Continue with review\n          - **On PR branch, behind HEAD, no changes:** Pull latest: `git pull origin <pr-branch>`\n          - **On PR branch, behind HEAD, with changes:** Ask user: \"Branch has uncommitted changes. Reset hard and pull HEAD? (y/n)\"\n          - **On different branch, no changes:** Switch to PR branch: `git checkout <pr-branch>`\n          - **On different branch, with changes:** Ask user: \"You are on branch X with uncommitted changes. Reset and switch to PR branch? (y/n)\"\n     * Continue with review in this context\n   - If no URL provided:\n     * Run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` to check if current directory is a git project\n     * If NOT a git project: **Exit early** with message: \"Not in a git repository and no PR URL provided. Please either navigate to a git project or provide a PR URL.\"\n     * If git project exists: proceed with current repository\n   - Check git status to identify changed files\n   - If no specific review aspects provided in arguments: **Ask user interactively** which aspects to review\n   - Present numbered list of available aspects and wait for user selection\n\n2. **Interactive Review Aspect Selection (if not provided in arguments)**\n\n   Present this numbered menu to user:\n   ```\n   Select review aspects (comma-separated numbers, or 0 for all):\n\n   0. All applicable reviews (comprehensive)\n   1. Comments - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability\n   2. Tests - Review test coverage quality and completeness\n   3. Errors - Check error handling for silent failures\n   4. Types - Analyze type design and invariants\n   5. Code - General code review for project guidelines\n   6. Simplify - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability\n\n   Example: \"1,2,3\" or \"0\" or \"2\"\n   ```\n\n   - Wait for user input\n   - Parse their selection (e.g., \"1,3,5\" → comments, errors, code)\n   - If user enters \"0\" or \"all\": run all applicable reviews\n   - Proceed to next step with selected aspects\n\n3. **Available Review Aspects Reference:**\n\n   - **comments** - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability\n   - **tests** - Review test coverage quality and completeness\n   - **errors** - Check error handling for silent failures\n   - **types** - Analyze type design and invariants (if new types added)\n   - **code** - General code review for project guidelines\n   - **simplify** - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability\n   - **all** - Run all applicable reviews (default)\n\n4. **Identify Changed Files**\n   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files\n   - Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`\n   - Identify file types and what reviews apply\n\n5. **Determine Applicable Reviews**\n\n   Based on changes:\n   - **Always applicable**: code-reviewer (general quality)\n   - **If test files changed**: pr-test-analyzer\n   - **If comments/docs added**: comment-analyzer\n   - **If error handling changed**: silent-failure-hunter\n   - **If types added/modified**: type-design-analyzer\n   - **After passing review**: code-simplifier (polish and refine)\n\n6. **Launch Review Agents**\n\n   **Sequential approach** (one at a time):\n   - Easier to understand and act on\n   - Each report is complete before next\n   - Good for interactive review\n\n   **Parallel approach** (user can request):\n   - Launch all agents simultaneously\n   - Faster for comprehensive review\n   - Results come back together\n\n7. **Aggregate Results**\n\n   After agents complete, summarize:\n   - **Critical Issues** (must fix before merge)\n   - **Important Issues** (should fix)\n   - **Suggestions** (nice to have)\n   - **Positive Observations** (what's good)\n\n8. **Provide Action Plan**\n\n   Organize findings:\n   ```markdown\n   # PR Review Summary\n\n   ## Critical Issues (X found)\n   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]\n\n   ## Important Issues (X found)\n   - [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]\n\n   ## Suggestions (X found)\n   - [agent-name]: Suggestion [file:line]\n\n   ## Strengths\n   - What's well-done in this PR\n\n   ## Recommended Action\n   1. Fix critical issues first\n   2. Address important issues\n   3. Consider suggestions\n   4. Re-run review after fixes\n   ```\n\n9. **Generate Review Document**\n\n   After completing the review, write a markdown file with appropriate naming convention.\n\n   **For PR URL reviews:**\n   - Filename: `pr_<PR_NUMBER>.md`\n   - Fetch PR details: `gh pr view <PR_URL> --json number,title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,body,additions,deletions,changedFiles`\n   - Extract ticket URL from PR body (look for patterns like Jira, GitHub issues, etc.)\n\n   **For local reviews:**\n   - Filename: `pr_local_<BRANCH_NAME>_<TIMESTAMP>.md` (e.g., `pr_local_feature-auth_20251010-143022.md`)\n   - Use timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n   - Generate metadata from git: author (git config user.name), branch names, file statistics\n\n   **File location:**\n   - Create `.pr-reviews/` directory in repository root if it doesn't exist\n   - Save review file as `.pr-reviews/<FILENAME>.md`\n   - Ensure `.pr-reviews/` is added to `.gitignore` so reviews are not committed\n\n   **Gitignore management:**\n   - Check if `.gitignore` exists in repository root\n   - If exists: Check if `.pr-reviews/` is already ignored\n   - If not ignored: Append `.pr-reviews/` to `.gitignore`\n   - If `.gitignore` doesn't exist: Create it with `.pr-reviews/` entry\n\n   **Document structure for PR reviews:**\n   ```markdown\n   pr_title: <PR_TITLE>\n   pr_link: <PR_URL>\n   author: <PR_AUTHOR_NAME>\n   branch: <TARGET_BRANCH> <- <SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME>\n   ticket: <TICKET_URL> (if there is any, otherwise \"N/A\")\n   files_changed: <NUMBER_OF_FILES_CHANGED> (+<ADDITIONS> -<DELETIONS>)\n\n   ## PR Description\n   <PR_EXACT_DESCRIPTION>\n\n   ## Summary\n   <EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY>\n\n   [Rest of the review content: Critical Issues, Important Issues, Suggestions, etc.]\n   ```\n\n   **Document structure for local reviews:**\n   ```markdown\n   review_type: Local Pre-Review\n   branch: <DEFAULT_BRANCH> <- <CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME>\n   author: <GIT_USER_NAME>\n   date: <REVIEW_DATE_TIME>\n   files_changed: <NUMBER_OF_FILES_CHANGED> (+<ADDITIONS> -<DELETIONS>)\n   ticket: <EXTRACTED_FROM_BRANCH_NAME_OR_COMMITS> (if detectable, otherwise \"N/A\")\n\n   ## Changes Summary\n   <SUMMARY_OF_LOCAL_CHANGES>\n\n   ## Summary\n   <EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY>\n\n   [Rest of the review content: Critical Issues, Important Issues, Suggestions, etc.]\n   ```\n\n   **Notes:**\n   - Use underscores for spaces in filename (e.g., `pr_123.md`)\n   - Preserve exact PR description formatting\n   - Executive summary should be 2-3 sentences highlighting key findings and risk level\n   - Reviews are kept local and not tracked in git\n\n10. **Provide Review File Location**\n\n   After successfully writing the review document:\n   - Display the absolute path to the review file\n   - Format: \"Review saved to: `/absolute/path/to/repo/.pr-reviews/pr_<NUMBER>.md`\"\n   - This allows users to easily locate and open the review file\n\n## Usage Examples:\n\n**Local pre-review (before creating PR):**\n```\n/github-toolkit:pr-review local\n# Reviews local changes against default branch (comprehensive)\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review local tests errors\n# Reviews only test coverage and error handling of local changes\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review local code\n# Quick code quality check before committing\n```\n\n**Review PR from URL:**\n```\n/github-toolkit:pr-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123\n# Clones repo (if needed), checks out PR branch, runs full review\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 tests errors\n# Reviews specific aspects of external PR\n```\n\n**Full review (current repo with existing PR):**\n```\n/github-toolkit:pr-review\n```\n\n**Specific aspects:**\n```\n/github-toolkit:pr-review tests errors\n# Reviews only test coverage and error handling\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review comments\n# Reviews only code comments\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review simplify\n# Simplifies code after passing review\n```\n\n**Parallel review:**\n```\n/github-toolkit:pr-review all parallel\n# Launches all agents in parallel\n\n/github-toolkit:pr-review local all parallel\n# Fast pre-review of local changes\n```\n\n## Agent Descriptions:\n\n**comment-analyzer**:\n- Verifies comment accuracy vs code\n- Identifies comment rot\n- Checks documentation completeness\n\n**pr-test-analyzer**:\n- Reviews behavioral test coverage\n- Identifies critical gaps\n- Evaluates test quality\n\n**silent-failure-hunter**:\n- Finds silent failures\n- Reviews catch blocks\n- Checks error logging\n\n**type-design-analyzer**:\n- Analyzes type encapsulation\n- Reviews invariant expression\n- Rates type design quality\n\n**code-reviewer**:\n- Checks CLAUDE.md compliance\n- Detects bugs and issues\n- Reviews general code quality\n\n**code-simplifier**:\n- Simplifies complex code\n- Improves clarity and readability\n- Applies project standards\n- Preserves functionality\n\n## Tips:\n\n- **Run early**: Before creating PR, not after\n- **Focus on changes**: Agents analyze git diff by default\n- **Address critical first**: Fix high-priority issues before lower priority\n- **Re-run after fixes**: Verify issues are resolved\n- **Use specific reviews**: Target specific aspects when you know the concern\n\n## Workflow Integration:\n\n**Before committing:**\n```\n1. Write code\n2. Run: /github-toolkit:pr-review code errors\n3. Fix any critical issues\n4. Commit\n```\n\n**Before creating PR:**\n```\n1. Stage all changes\n2. Run: /github-toolkit:pr-review all\n3. Address all critical and important issues\n4. Run specific reviews again to verify\n5. Create PR\n```\n\n**After PR feedback:**\n```\n1. Make requested changes\n2. Run targeted reviews based on feedback\n3. Verify issues are resolved\n4. Push updates\n```\n\n## Notes:\n\n- Agents run autonomously and return detailed reports\n- Each agent focuses on its specialty for deep analysis\n- Results are actionable with specific file:line references\n- Agents use appropriate models for their complexity\n- All agents available in `/agents` list"
