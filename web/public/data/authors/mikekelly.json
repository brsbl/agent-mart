        "README.md": "# Promode\n\nPromode is a Claude Code plugin that implements a **methodology for AI agents to develop software**. It emphasises TDD, context conservation, progressive disclosure, and clear delegation patterns.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n- **TDD is non-negotiable**: Write failing tests first, then implementation. No exceptions.\n- **Context is precious**: Main agents delegate aggressively to subagents to conserve main agent context for high level planning and user conversation. Subagents enjoy a context focused on a specific task.\n- **Tests are the documentation**: Executable tests document system behaviour, not markdown files.\n- **Progressive disclosure**: CLAUDE.md defines agent behaviour; README.md files hold project knowledge. READMEs are distributed across relevant subcomponents and discovered by reference — agents load only the sections they need, further conserving context.\n\n## What Promode Provides\n\n### The Promode Subagent\n\nClaude Code subagents don't inherit CLAUDE.md from the main conversation. This is a problem: subagents spawned via the Task tool don't know your project conventions.\n\n**Solution**: The `promode-subagent` has the methodology baked in. When delegating, prefer it over the built-in agent:\n\n```\nUse the promode-subagent to [task description]\n```\n\nThe subagent already knows TDD, behavioural-authority, context conservation, and all promode conventions.\n\n### Skills\n\n- **managing-skills** — Install, update, list, and remove skills from GitHub repos or local sources\n- **managing-claude-code-meta** — Set up, migrate, and audit CLAUDE.md files following promode conventions\n\n### MCP Servers\n\nThe plugin includes three MCP servers that start automatically when the plugin is enabled:\n\n- **context7** — Fetches up-to-date official documentation for libraries ([upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7))\n- **exa** — Real-time web search powered by Exa AI (requires `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable)\n- **grep_app** — Ultra-fast code search across millions of public GitHub repositories via [grep.app](https://grep.app)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add mikekelly/promode\n/plugin install promode\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code and tell Claude:\n\n```\nUpdate the claude code meta to install promode\n```\n\n## Skills Management\n\nManaging Claude Code skills is awkward without tooling. You either need to use marketplace commands repeatedly or manually download files from GitHub.\n\nPromode's skill management lets you just ask Claude:\n\n- \"Install the skill mikekelly/debugging-react-native\"\n- \"Install the skill https://github.com/metabase/metabase/tree/master/.claude/skills/typescript-review\"\n- \"Update my installed skills\"\n- \"Remove the pdf skill\"\n- \"List my installed skills\"\n\n### Why Skills Matter\n\nSkills are an important way to enhance Claude Code. Many MCP servers would likely be better off packaged as skills—they're simpler to create, don't require running a separate process, and integrate more naturally with Claude's workflow.\n\n### Skills vs MCPs\n\nMCPs provide deterministic tools that the model calls—useful, but limited. Skills offer something more powerful: the ability to blend the determinism of scripts with the advanced reasoning of the model. A skill can guide Claude through a complex workflow, injecting structured steps where needed while letting the model apply judgment at decision points.\n\nThis hybrid approach makes more efficient use of both context and model capabilities. Instead of burning tokens on rigid back-and-forth tool calls, skills let you encode expertise directly into prompts that the model can interpret and adapt.\n\nOne reason more capabilities aren't packaged as skills is that MCP has better tooling for packaging and distribution. Skills Management is an attempt to fix this gap.\n\nSkills Management promotes a simple packaging model: **a skill is a git repo**. This allows for:\n- Clean forking of skills to customize them\n- Issue tracking for bugs and feature requests\n- Pull requests for community contributions\n- Version history and release management\n\nSkills Management also supports installing individual skills from subdirectories within larger repos or plugins—the current common approach to sharing skills. This gives you the best of both worlds: use standalone repos for your own skills, while still accessing skills packaged in collections.\n\n### Supported Sources\n\n- GitHub repositories (`user/repo`)\n- GitHub subdirectory URLs (`github.com/user/repo/tree/branch/path`)\n- `.skill` zip files\n\nSkills Management handles both user level (`~/.claude/skills/`) and project level (`.claude/skills/`).\n"

        "README.md": "# Promode\n\nPromode is a Claude Code plugin that provides a **methodology for AI agents to develop software**.\n\n## The Core Idea\n\n**The repo is always ready for a fresh agent.**\n\nAny agent should be able to pick up the work with zero context from previous conversations. The human decides when to bring in a fresh agent; the methodology ensures that's always possible.\n\nThis changes how agents work:\n\n| Traditional approach | Promode approach |\n|---------------------|------------------|\n| Agent accumulates context over a session | All state lives in committed files |\n| Handoff requires explanation | Handoff requires reading TODO.md |\n| Context exhaustion is a problem | Context exhaustion is a non-event |\n| Session continuity matters | Sessions are disposable |\n\n## How It Works\n\n### TODO.md is the handoff mechanism\n\n`TODO.md` must always answer \"what's next?\" Before stepping away from work, the agent ensures TODO.md clearly describes what a fresh agent should do first.\n\nA fresh agent reads:\n1. `CLAUDE.md` — how to work (the promode methodology)\n2. `README.md` — what this project is\n3. `TODO.md` — what to do next\n\nThat's the complete handoff. No context sharing, no session history, no explanation needed.\n\n### Failing tests capture intent\n\nWhen implementing a feature, write failing tests first. If context runs out mid-implementation, those failing tests tell the next agent exactly what behaviour is expected. The tests are the specification.\n\n### Plan docs are committed state\n\nPlans go in `docs/` as committed markdown. If context runs out mid-plan, the next agent reads the plan and continues. Plans are deleted once tests verify the behaviour.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n- **TDD is non-negotiable** — Write failing tests first, then implementation. No exceptions.\n- **Repo as source of truth** — All state lives in committed files. Nothing important exists only in agent context.\n- **Continuous handoff readiness** — Work so that any agent can pick up with zero prior context.\n- **Tests are the documentation** — Executable tests document behaviour, not markdown files.\n\n## What Promode Provides\n\n### Skills\n\n- **managing-skills** — Install, update, list, and remove skills from GitHub repos or local sources\n- **managing-claude-code-meta** — Set up, migrate, and audit CLAUDE.md files following promode conventions\n\n### MCP Servers\n\nThe plugin includes three MCP servers that start automatically:\n\n- **context7** — Fetches up-to-date official documentation for libraries\n- **exa** — Real-time web search (requires `EXA_API_KEY`)\n- **grep_app** — Code search across public GitHub repositories\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add mikekelly/promode\n/plugin install promode\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code and tell Claude:\n\n```\nUpdate the claude code meta to install promode\n```\n\n## Skills Management\n\nPromode includes skill management that lets you ask Claude directly:\n\n- \"Install the skill mikekelly/debugging-react-native\"\n- \"Install the skill https://github.com/metabase/metabase/tree/master/.claude/skills/typescript-review\"\n- \"Update my installed skills\"\n- \"Remove the pdf skill\"\n- \"List my installed skills\"\n\n### Supported Sources\n\n- GitHub repositories (`user/repo`)\n- GitHub subdirectory URLs (`github.com/user/repo/tree/branch/path`)\n- `.skill` zip files\n\nSkills Management handles both user level (`~/.claude/skills/`) and project level (`.claude/skills/`).\n\n## Why Skills Over MCPs\n\nMCPs provide deterministic tools — useful, but limited.
