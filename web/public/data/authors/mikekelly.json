        "README.md": "# Promode\n\n## Why Promode?\n\nPromode is a battle-tested methodology for AI-assisted software development. It covers the full lifecycle:\n\n- **Project management** — Task tracking, dependencies, progress visibility\n- **Brainstorming** — Structured ideation with the user\n- **Product design** — Feature specification and acceptance criteria\n- **Research & analysis** — Codebase exploration, documentation lookup\n- **Planning** — Implementation strategy before writing code\n- **Execution** — Parallel task delegation to specialised agents\n- **Test-driven development** — Verify behaviour with tests, not inspection\n- **Code review** — Separate review phase before work is complete\n\nThe methodology is designed for efficiency: conservative use of context, intelligent model selection for speed and cost, and aggressive delegation to keep the main conversation focused on high level objectives, not implementation detail.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) (vanilla install works fine)\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nRun two commands to get the plugin setup:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add mikekelly/promode\n```\n\n```\n/plugin install promode\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code and prompt Claude to install promode (update your CLAUDE.md, etc):\n\n```\nUpdate the claude code meta to install promode\n```\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe main agent handles high-level work: brainstorming with the user, designing features, planning implementation, and orchestrating execution. It delegates implementation to phase-specific agents:\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `promode:implementer` | TDD workflow, write code |\n| `promode:reviewer` | Code review, approve or request rework |\n| `promode:tester` | Run tests, parse results, critique quality |\n| `promode:debugger` | Root cause analysis, fix failures |\n| `promode:smoke-tester` | Create and execute smoke tests as markdown |\n| `promode:git-manager` | Commits, pushes, PRs, git research |\n| `promode:environment-manager` | Docker, services, health checks, scripts |\n\nEach agent has the methodology embedded in its definition—they know TDD practices, behavioural-authority rules, and how to report results. Subagents commit changes before reporting back.\n\nTasks can run in parallel when independent, improving throughput on larger features.\n\n---\n\n## What's Included\n\n**Phase Agents** — Implementation, review, and debugging agents with methodology baked in.\n\n**Skills:**\n- **managing-skills** — Install, update, and remove skills from GitHub or local sources\n- **managing-claude-code-meta** — Set up, migrate, and audit CLAUDE.md files\n\n**MCP Servers (auto-start):**\n- **context7** — Library documentation ([upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7))\n- **exa** — Web search (requires `EXA_API_KEY`)\n- **grep_app** — Code search via [grep.app](https://grep.app)\n\n\n---\n\n## Skills Management\n\nPromode makes skill management conversational:\n\n- \"Install the skill mikekelly/debugging-react-native\"\n- \"Install the skill from https://github.com/metabase/metabase/tree/master/.claude/skills/typescript-review\"\n- \"Update my installed skills\"\n- \"Remove the pdf skill\"\n\nWorks with both user-level (`~/.claude/skills/`) and project-level (`.claude/skills/`) installations.\n"
