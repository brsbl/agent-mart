Pulls from your `memory/` directory:\n     - Project overview (research questions, hypotheses, data sources...)\n     - Recent N devlog entries\n     - Current TODO list\n   - Automatically generates \"recent progress + suggested work plan\"\n\n2. **Session Logging: `research_memory_log_session`**\n   - Structured recording of research work into:\n     - `devlog.md`: Organized by research phases (DGP / data_preprocess / data_analyse / modeling / robustness / writing / infra / notes)\n     - `experiments.csv`: One line per experiment (hypothesis/dataset/model/metrics/notes...)\n     - `decisions.md`: Key decisions and their rationale/alternatives\n     - `todos.md`: Add new items while marking completed ones as `[x]`\n\n3. **History Query: `research_memory_query_history`**\n   - Search using keywords + simple filters (date / phase / type) across:\n     - `devlog.md`\n     - `decisions.md`\n     - `experiments.csv`\n   - Returns summaries + key snippets.\n\n**Everything runs on local text files (Markdown + CSV), plays nicely with Git, is manually editable, and has zero external service dependencies.**\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nOverall structure:\n\n```text\nresearch-memory/\n├── handlers.py        # Skill's Python implementation & CLI entry point\n├── SKILL.md           # Claude Code Skill description (tool definitions)\n├── config/\n│   └── config.json    # Skill behavior configuration\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md      # Project-level instructions, telling Claude when to use this skill\n│   └── settings.local.json  # Claude Code local settings example\n└── memory/            # Actual \"project memory layer\" (auto-creatable)\n    ├── project-overview.md  # Long-term project information\n    ├── devlog.md            # Development/analysis log (by session + phase)\n    ├── decisions.md         # Key decision records\n    ├── experiments.csv      # Experiment table (structured)\n    └── todos.md             # TODO / open questions\n```\n\nCore components:\n\n* **Skill Layer**\n\n  * `SKILL.md` defines three tools:\n\n    * `research_memory_bootstrap`\n    * `research_memory_log_session`\n    * `research_memory_query_history`\n  * Called by Claude Code to corresponding functions in `handlers.py`.\n\n* **Backend Layer**\n\n  * `MemoryBackend` encapsulates all file I/O, configuration loading, and TODO processing logic:\n\n    * Currently local Markdown + CSV;\n    * Can be replaced with SQLite / vector database / MCP server in the future without changing the outer interface.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nIn Claude Code, register the marketplace first:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add syfyufei/research-memory\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from this marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install research-memory@research-memory-marketplace\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nCheck that commands appear:\n\n```bash\n/help\n```\n\n```\n# Should see 10 commands:\n# /research-memory:bootstrap - Restore project context and generate work plan\n# /research-memory:status - Quick project status overview\n# /research-memory:focus - Get focused daily work plan\n# /research-memory:remember - Remember current work session\n# /research-memory:query - Query research memory history\n# /research-memory:timeline - Visualize project timeline\n# /research-memory:summary - Generate comprehensive project summary\n# /research-memory:review - Review work in a specific time period\n# /research-memory:insights - Get AI-powered insights and suggestions\n# /research-memory:checkpoint - Create a named checkpoint of current state\n```\n\n### Quick Start\n\nResearch Memory can be used in two ways:\n\n**Option 1: Slash Commands**\n\nCore commands:\n```bash\n/research-memory:bootstrap    # Restore project context\n/research-memory:status       # Quick status overview\n/research-memory:focus        # Get today's focused work plan\n/research-memory:remember     # Remember current session\n/research-memory:query        # Search history\n```\n\nAnalysis & reporting:\n```bash\n/research-memory:timeline     # Show project timeline\n/research-memory:summary      # Generate full project summary\n/research-memory:review       # Review specific time period\n/research-memory:insights     # Get AI insights\n/research-memory:checkpoint   # Create state checkpoint\n```\n\n**Option 2: Natural Language**\n\n```\n\"Research Memory, help me get back up to speed with my project\"\n\"Show me a quick status of the project\"\n\"What should I focus on today?\"\n\"Remember this work session\"\n\"Search for our decisions about spatial lag models\"\n\"Generate a project summary for my weekly meeting\"\n```\n\nResearch Memory will automatically create the necessary `memory/` directory and files on first use.\n\n### Uninstallation\n\n**If installed via marketplace**:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin uninstall research-memory\n```\n\n**If installed manually**:\n\n```bash\n# Remove the skill files from your project\nrm -f handlers.py config/config.json .claude/CLAUDE.md SKILL.md\nrm -rf config/ .claude/ memory/\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration: `config/config.json`\n\nAll behavior is controlled by one JSON configuration file, default configuration looks like this (excerpt):\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"memory_directory\": \"memory\",\n  \"encoding\": \"utf-8\",\n  \"csv_delimiter\": \",\",\n  \"timestamp_format\": \"ISO8601\",\n\n  \"bootstrap\": {\n    \"recent_entries_count\": 5,\n    \"include_todos\": true,\n    \"suggest_work_plan\": true\n  },\n\n  \"logging\": {\n    \"auto_timestamp\": true,\n    \"phase_sections\": [\n      \"DGP\",\n      \"data_preprocess\",\n      \"data_analyse\",\n      \"modeling\",\n      \"robustness\",\n      \"writing\",\n      \"infra\",\n      \"notes\"\n    ],\n    \"experiment_schema\": [\n      \"hypothesis\",\n      \"dataset\",\n      \"model\",\n      \"metrics\",\n      \"notes\"\n    ]\n  },\n\n  \"search\": {\n    \"max_results\": 10,\n    \"include_context\": true,\n    \"context_lines\": 3\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey field descriptions:\n\n* `memory_directory`: Memory file directory (relative to project root);\n\n* `encoding`: File encoding (default `utf-8`, can also be changed to `gbk`, etc.);\n\n* `timestamp_format`:\n\n  * `\"ISO8601\"` → e.g., `2025-12-03T19:30:00+09:00`\n  * `\"YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS\"` → suitable for filenames / human reading\n  * `\"timestamp\"` → Unix timestamp (seconds);\n\n* `bootstrap.recent_entries_count`: How many recent devlog entries to show on startup;\n\n* `logging.phase_sections`: Supported research phase tags;\n\n* `logging.experiment_schema`: Required fields in `experiments.csv`;\n\n* `search.*`: Number of results returned on query and whether to include context.\n\nYou can modify `config.json` as needed, all configuration items are effective in `MemoryBackend`.\n\n---\n\n## Using with Claude Code\n\n### Typical Usage Patterns\n\n**1. Starting your day: Getting back up to speed**\n\n> \"Hey, help me get back up to speed with my research using research-memory, and suggest a plan for today.\"\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n* Calls `research_memory_bootstrap`:\n\n  * Reads `project-overview.md` (if it exists);\n  * Extracts recent N devlog entries (with timestamps + phase info);\n  * Summarizes current incomplete TODOs;\n  * Generates a \"today's work suggestion plan\".\n\n---\n\n**2. Completing a work session: Logging your progress**\n\n> \"Help me organize this work session into a research log, broken down by DGP / data_analyse / modeling phases, and save it to research-memory.\"\n\nClaude will:\n\n1. Based on current conversation content and what you just did, construct a payload, for example:\n\n   ```jsonc\n   {\n     \"session_goal\": \"Run spatial DiD on MCIB_v1.3 to verify H2\",\n     \"changes_summary\": [\n       \"Updated 01_clean_mcib.R, added treat_window_180 variable\",\n       \"Filtered municipalities with sample count < 100\"\n     ],\n     \"phases\": {\n       \"DGP\": \"Assume treatment effects gradually appear within 0-180 days, use distance threshold 50km to construct weight matrix.\",\n       \"data_analyse\": \"Plot baseline period cognitive mean comparison for treatment/control groups, no obvious pre-trend crossover observed.\",\n       \"modeling\": \"Estimate two specifications: TWFE + cluster by municipality; extended specification with provincial time trends.\",\n       \"robustness\": \"Simple placebo: shift treatment time by 1 year overall, results not significant.\"\n     },\n     \"experiments\": [\n       {\n         \"hypothesis\": \"H2\",\n         \"dataset\": \"MCIB_v1.3\",\n         \"model\": \"Spatial DiD with 50km binary contiguity W\",\n         \"metrics\": {\n           \"ATT\": 0.153,\n           \"p_value\": 0.021\n         },\n         \"notes\": \"Results sensitive to window setting, need further robustness checks.\"\n       }\n     ],\n     \"decisions\": [\n       {\n         \"title\": \"Tentatively adopt Model B as main specification\",\n         \"rationale\": \"Pre-trend smoother after adding provincial time trends, coefficients more stable.\",\n         \"alternatives\": [\n           \"Continue using simple TWFE as main specification\",\n           \"Try event-study form\"\n         ]\n       }\n     ],\n     \"todos\": [\n       \"Add k-nearest neighbors based spatial weight matrix comparison\",\n       \"Systematically organize placebo/alternative spec results into paper.qmd\"\n     ],\n     \"completed_todos\": [\n       \"Add spatial weight matrix construction explanation in Methods section\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Call `research_memory_log_session(payload)`, automatically:\n\n   * Append a timestamped session record to `devlog.md`;\n   * Insert a complete experiment information row to `experiments.csv`;\n   * Write decision block to `decisions.md`;\n   * Add new TODOs to `todos.md`, and mark items in `completed_todos` as completed.\n\nAfter that, you just need to naturally describe \"what you just did\", and the Skill will help you turn it into structured memory that can be long-term retrieved.\n\n---\n\n**3. Looking back: Reviewing past decisions and experiments**\n\n> \"Why did we abandon spatial lag models before?\"\n> \"Show me all experiments we ran for H2.\"\n> \"Look up changes related to hksarg_parser.R.\"\n\nClaude will call:\n\n```python\nquery_history(query, filters=None)\n```\n\nThe Skill will:\n\n* Perform keyword matching across `devlog.md` / `decisions.md` / `experiments.csv`;\n* Return up to `search.max_results` matches per your configuration;\n* Attach necessary context (a few lines before and after);\n* Generate a brief summary, telling you:\n\n  * What decisions were made at that time;\n  * Which experiments were conducted;\n  * Which alternative approaches/specifications were abandoned.\n\n---\n\n## Command Line Usage (Optional)\n\nBesides calling through Claude Code, you can also directly operate `handlers.py` from the command line—suitable for when you temporarily don't have Claude open, or want to use scripts for batch processing.\n\n### 1. Bootstrap\n\n```bash\npython handlers.py bootstrap\n```\n\nOutput a JSON, including:\n\n* `project_context`\n* `recent_progress`\n* `current_todos`\n* `work_plan_suggestions`\n* `timestamp`\n\n### 2. Record Session\n\n```bash\npython handlers.py log-session \\\n  --payload-json '{\n    \"session_goal\": \"Test CLI logging\",\n    \"changes_summary\": [\"Update README examples\"],\n    \"phases\": {\"notes\": \"First time using research-memory from command line\"},\n    \"todos\": [\"Reference this tool in paper.qmd\"]\n  }'\n```\n\n### 3. Query History\n\n```bash\n# Simplest: search by keywords\npython handlers.py query --question \"spatial lag model\"\n\n# With filters: time + phase + type\npython handlers.py query \\\n  --question \"H2\" \\\n  --from-date 2025-01-01 \\\n  --to-date 2025-12-31 \\\n  --phase modeling \\\n  --type experiments \\\n  --limit 5\n```\n\nCLI will output JSON, convenient for you to continue using in other scripts.\n\n---\n\n## File Format Examples\n\n### `memory/devlog.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Development Log\n\n## 2025-12-03 10:15\n\n**Session Goal**: Run spatial DiD on MCIB_v1.3 to verify H2\n\n**Changes Summary**:\n- Updated 01_clean_mcib.R, added treat_window_180 variable\n- Filtered out municipalities with sample count < 100\n\n### DGP\nAssume treatment effects gradually appear within 0-180 days, use 50km threshold to construct binary spatial weight matrix and row standardize.\n\n### data_analyse\nPlot baseline period cognitive mean comparison for treatment vs control groups, no obvious pre-trend crossover observed.\n\n### modeling\nEstimate two specifications: Model A (TWFE), Model B (TWFE + provincial time trends), H2 coefficients consistent in both directions.\n\n### robustness\nDid simple placebo test (shift treatment time by one year overall), effect not significant.\n\n### notes\nNeed to further try event-study and different spatial weight matrices.\n\n---\n\n```\n\n### `memory/experiments.csv` (header example)\n\n```csv\ntimestamp,experiment_id,hypothesis,dataset,model,metrics,notes,research_phase\n2025-12-03T10:15:00+09:00,exp_20251203_101500,H2,MCIB_v1.3,\"Spatial DiD, W=50km\",{\"ATT\":0.153,\"p_value\":0.021},\"placebo results unstable\",\"DGP,data_analyse,modeling,robustness\"\n```\n\n### `memory/todos.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Project TODOs\n\n- [ ] Add k-nearest neighbors based spatial weight matrix comparison\n- [x] Add spatial weight matrix construction explanation in Methods section (completed: 2025-12-03 - via log_session)\n```\n\n### `memory/decisions.md`\n\n```markdown\n# Key Decisions\n\n## 2025-12-03 10:20 — Tentatively adopt Model B as main specification\n\n**Decision**\nUse TWFE with provincial time trends as main specification.\n\n**Rationale**\nPre-trend smoother, estimation results more stable across different subsamples.\n\n**Alternatives**\n- Keep simple TWFE as main specification\n- Switch to event-study + group-specific trends\n```\n\n---\n\n## Design Principles\n\n* **Local-first**: Everything is local text files, Git-manageable, manually editable;\n* **Skill-first**: Claude Code calls through skill tools, you don't need to care about specific file paths;\n* **Extensible**: Through `MemoryBackend` abstraction layer, can seamlessly switch to database / MCP / remote services in the future;\n* **Semantically aligned with research workflow**:\n\n  * DGP / data_preprocess / data_analyse / modeling / robustness / writing / infra / notes\n  * Instead of just writing a few lines like \"changed some code today\".\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrent version is **v0.x (file backend version)**, future considerations include:\n\n* Support SQLite / DuckDB as backend (stronger query capabilities, support aggregation analysis);\n* Add vector retrieval, provide fuzzy matching for long devlogs;\n* MCP / HTTP service mode, can be shared by multiple projects / Agents;\n* Locking and merge strategies for multi-user collaboration scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## License & Author\n\n* **License**: MIT\n* **Author**: Yufei Sun (Adrian) `<syfyufei@gmail.com>`\n* **Repo**: [https://github.com/syfyufei/research-memory](https://github.com/syfyufei/research-memory)\n\n---\n\nIf you frequently juggle multiple large projects\nand dread spending half a day each time \"remembering what yesterday's you was thinking\",\ntry installing `research-memory` into your research repositories—\nlet Claude Code become a partner that **truly remembers your entire project history**,\ninstead of just a chat interface that only remembers the current conversation.\n\n```\n::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n```"
