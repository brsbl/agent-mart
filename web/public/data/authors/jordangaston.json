        "plugins/bod/README.md": "# Board of Directors\n\nA Claude Code plugin that gives you a personal Board of Directors — digital personas of great leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs you can consult individually or convene as a deliberating team.\n\n## Skills\n\n### `/bod:consult <member> [question]`\n\nOne-on-one conversation with a board member. The member stays in character for the duration of the session.\n\n```\n/bod:consult Naval\n/bod:consult Socrates -- What is the good life?\n\"What would Feynman think about this?\"\n```\n\n### `/bod:board [members --] <question>`\n\nConvene the full board (or a subset) for a structured deliberation. A moderator facilitates debate and produces a synthesized recommendation.\n\n```\n/bod:board Should I raise venture funding?\n/bod:board Naval, Socrates, Ray Dalio -- How should I think about risk?\n```\n\n### `/bod:manage-board <action>`\n\nAdd, remove, or list board members.\n\n```\n/bod:manage-board list\n/bod:manage-board add Charlie Munger\n/bod:manage-board remove Elon Musk\n\"Add Warren Buffett to my board\"\n```\n\n## Current Board Members\n\n| Name | Expertise |\n|:-----|:----------|\n| Naval Ravikant | Startups, wealth creation, philosophy, leverage |\n| Ed Thorp | Quantitative analysis, risk management, probability, investing |\n| Toby Lutke | Product engineering, company building, systems thinking |\n| Elon Musk | First-principles engineering, scaling, manufacturing |\n| Barack Obama | Leadership, communication, coalition building, policy |\n| Richard Feynman | Physics, scientific method, curiosity-driven problem solving |\n| Socrates | Critical questioning, ethics, dialectic method |\n| Marcus Aurelius | Stoic philosophy, leadership under pressure, self-discipline |\n| Mark Zuckerberg | Platform building, move-fast culture, long-term vision |\n| Ray Dalio | Radical transparency, principles-based decisions, macro investing |\n| Bill Walsh | Organizational culture, coaching, The Standard of Performance |\n| Tim Grover | Mental toughness, elite performance, relentless mindset |\n\n## Custom Context\n\nAdd context files to any member's `members/{slug}/context/` folder. Use YAML frontmatter for discovery:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: Wealth Creation Philosophy\ndescription: Naval's framework for creating wealth through specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.\n---\n\n[Your content here]\n```\n\nThe agent reads frontmatter descriptions first and loads full content only when relevant to the question.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ~/workspace/bod\n```\n"
