        "README.md": "# Stata Skills for Claude Code\n\nThis project contains two Claude Code skills:\n\n1. **Stata** — A comprehensive reference that tells Claude how to use Stata. Covers core syntax, data management, econometrics, causal inference, graphics, and 20+ community packages.\n\n2. **Stata C Plugins** — A skill that tells Claude how to make Stata code that uses C plugins to do things. It includes information that Claude can use to translate existing packages into C plugins that can be called from Stata. This is very useful because it means you can do things in Stata that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do very easily.\n\nAs long as you can find an existing package somewhere, you can just let Claude go look at the existing Python package and this skill provides a workflow that Claude can use to develop a replication of whatever it is, implemented in Python or R or whatever, that runs in Stata and uses a C plugin. In many if not most cases, you should be able to get something that runs at least as fast in Stata as it did in the original language, if not faster.\n\n## What's Included\n\n### Skill 1: Stata\n\n**37 core reference files** covering:\n- Data import/export, management, and cleaning\n- Linear regression, panel data, time series\n- Limited dependent variables, survival analysis, SEM\n- Causal inference: DiD, RD, matching, treatment effects\n- Mata programming and matrix operations\n- Graphics, tables, and reporting\n- Workflow best practices\n\n**20 community package guides** including:\n- `reghdfe` — high-dimensional fixed effects\n- `estout` / `outreg2` — publication-quality tables\n- `csdid`, `did_multiplegt` — modern DiD estimators\n- `rdrobust` — regression discontinuity\n- `psmatch2` — propensity score matching\n- `synth` — synthetic control\n- `ivreg2` / `xtabond2` — IV and dynamic panel GMM\n- And more (binsreg, coefplot, grstyle, winsor2, gtools, ...)\n\n### Skill 2: Stata C Plugins\n\n**Reference files** covering:\n- Stata plugin SDK (`stplugin.h`) setup and data flow\n- Memory safety, debugging, and common failure modes\n- `.ado` wrapper patterns (preserve/merge, plugin loading)\n- Cross-platform compilation (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n- Performance optimization (pthreads, pre-sorted indices, XorShift RNG)\n- Packaging and distribution via `net install`\n- Translation workflow for porting Python/R packages to Stata\n- Testing strategy with correlation-based validation against reference implementations\n\n## Installation\n\nIn Claude Code, first add the repo:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add dylantmoore/stata-skill\n```\n\nThen install whichever skills you need:\n\n```\n/plugin install stata@dylantmoore-stata-skill\n/plugin install stata-c-plugins@dylantmoore-stata-skill\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nBoth skills use **progressive disclosure**: a compact SKILL.md file loaded on activation directs Claude to read only the reference files relevant to the current task. This keeps context usage efficient while giving Claude access to detailed reference documents when needed.\n\n## Coverage\n\n| Category | Files | Topics |\n|----------|-------|--------|\n| Data Operations | 7 | Import, management, strings, dates, math functions |\n| Statistics | 10 | Regression, panel, time series, MLE, GMM, survey, MI |\n| Causal Inference | 5 | DiD, RD, matching, treatment effects, selection |\n| Advanced Methods | 5 | Survival, SEM, nonparametric, spatial, ML/lasso |\n| Programming | 6 | Do-files, macros, loops, Mata |\n| Output & Workflow | 3 | Tables, reporting, best practices, external tools |\n| Packages | 20 | Community-contributed packages |\n| C Plugins | 4 | SDK patterns, performance, packaging, translation |\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add documentation for new Stata packages.
