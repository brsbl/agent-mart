        "README.md": "# Mim - Persistent Memory for Claude Code\n\n## Description\n\nMim is an AI-powered knowledge management system for Claude Code. It automatically captures, organizes, and validates project-specific knowledge so nothing learned is ever lost.\n\nKnowledge is organized into categories:\n- **Architecture** - System design decisions and structural patterns\n- **Patterns** - Recurring code patterns and best practices\n- **Dependencies** - Package relationships and version constraints\n- **Workflows** - Development processes and automation\n- **Gotchas** - Edge cases, pitfalls, and lessons learned\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 18+\n\n## Installation\n\nOnce per machine:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add lucianHymer/mim\n```\n\nOnce per repo:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install mim-ai@mim-marketplace --scope project\n```\n\nThat's it. Mim will guide you through the rest.\n\n## How It Works\n\nOnce installed, everything happens in the background:\n\n1. **Automatic capture**: As you work, Claude uses `remember()` to capture discoveries about your codebase\n2. **Background processing**: Direct file writes, no queue, instant\n3. **Validation**: `/mim:validate` checks knowledge against current codebase\n4. **Review**: `/mim:review` resolves ambiguous items interactively\n\nThe knowledge is loaded into Claude's memory through your project's `CLAUDE.md` file. Use `/memory` or `/context` in Claude Code to verify it's working.\n\n### Commands\n\n- `/mim:validate` - Check all knowledge entries against current codebase\n- `/mim:review` - Resolve unresolved knowledge items interactively\n- `/mim:remember` - Learn about the remember workflow\n\n## Credits\n\n- Built on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n\n## License\n\n[FSL-1.1-MIT](LICENSE) — Free to use, modify, and share. Just don't use it to compete with Mim.\n\n---\n\nNorse mythology tells of Mímir, guardian of the Wellspring beneath Yggdrasil\nwhere all knowledge pools and swirls. The Vanir claimed his head. Odin\nclaimed it back. Now preserved in herbs and rune-magic, the severed head\nwhispers secrets from the cosmic deep - deathless, sleepless, all-remembering.\n\nMim captures what Claude Code discovers in its wanderings, preserving each\ninsight in an ever-growing Wellspring of Knowledge.\nNothing learned is lost.\nEvery discovery feeds the depths.\n\nWhat dies in context lives eternal in the Wellspring.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <i>\n        A knowledge accumulation system for Claude Code that\n        never forgets what it learns.\n    </i>\n    <br><br>\n    <img\n        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucianHymer/mim/refs/heads/main/assets/mim.jpg\"\n        width=\"320px\"\n        alt=\"Odin and Mimir's Head\"\n        title=\"Odin and Mimir's Head, 2006 Sam Flegal, https://www.germanicmythology.com/works/TMMimirsHead.html\"\n    >\n    <br>\n    <b>Odin with Mímir's Head</b>\n</p>\n"
