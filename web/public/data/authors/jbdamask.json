Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with its description and usage instructions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo add a new skill:\n\n1. Create a directory under `skills/<skill-name>/`\n2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and instructions\n3. Optionally add `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` subdirectories\n",
        "plugins/context-analyzer/README.md": "# context-analyzer\n\nA Claude Code plugin that analyzes chat history to identify what's consuming your context window and provides optimization recommendations.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Context breakdown** — Categorizes context consumption by type (images, file reads, bash output, screenshots, etc.)\n- **File re-read detection** — Identifies files that are read repeatedly across sessions, wasting context\n- **Largest session analysis** — Finds which sessions consumed the most context and why\n- **Actionable recommendations** — Provides prioritized suggestions to reduce context bloat\n- **Auto-detection** — Automatically finds the project history directory from your current working directory\n\n## Components\n\n| Component | Name | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Command | `/context-analyzer:analyze-context` | Run the full analysis and get a report |\n| Agent | `context-analyzer` | Subagent for autonomous context diagnostics |\n| Skill | Context Optimization | Knowledge about context optimization patterns |\n| Script | `analyze_context.py` | Python analysis engine (no dependencies beyond stdlib) |\n\n## Installation\n\n### From a marketplace\n\n```\n/plugin install context-analyzer@your-marketplace\n```\n\n### Local testing\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/context-analyzer\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Slash command\n\n```\n/context-analyzer:analyze-context\n```\n\nRuns the analysis on the current project and presents a formatted report.\n\n### Agent (automatic)\n\nThe context-analyzer agent triggers when you ask questions like:\n- \"Why is my context filling up?\"\n- \"Analyze my context usage\"\n- \"What's consuming my context window?\"\n\n### Direct script execution\n\n```bash\n# Markdown report (default)\npython3 scripts/analyze_context.py ~/.claude/projects/-Your-Project-Path/\n\n# JSON output for programmatic use\npython3 scripts/analyze_context.py ~/.claude/projects/-Your-Project-Path/ --json\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.8+ (uses only stdlib — no pip install needed)\n- Claude Code chat history in `~/.claude/projects/`\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe plugin parses JSONL chat history files that Claude Code stores in `~/.claude/projects/{encoded-project-path}/`. Each line is a JSON message representing a conversation event. The analyzer categorizes every message into context consumption buckets and tracks file read patterns across all sessions.\n\nSee `skills/context-optimization/references/analysis-methodology.md` for details.\n",
        "plugins/beads-planner/README.md": "# beads-planner\n\nA Claude Code plugin that converts GitHub issues into structured [Beads](https://github.com/beads-project/beads) work breakdowns — epics, tasks, and sub-tasks with objectively verifiable acceptance criteria.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\n/beads-planner #42\n/beads-planner https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Beads** initialized in your project (`bd init`)\n- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) authenticated for the target repo\n- **Beads CLI** (`bd`) on your PATH\n\n## What It Does\n\nGiven a GitHub issue, the plugin:\n\n1. **Fetches** the issue content and linked references\n2. **Creates a branch and worktree** for isolated work (`42-add-user-auth`)\n3. **Plans** the implementation (codebase exploration, no auto-execution)\n4. **Breaks down** the work into epics/tasks/sub-tasks with the user\n5. **Files beads** with descriptions, priorities, dependencies, and acceptance criteria\n6. **Reviews and refines** the breakdown (up to 5 passes)\n7. **Pushes** the branch and labels the GitHub issue as \"Ready\"\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\nbeads-planner/\n├── commands/\n│   └── beads-planner.md       # /beads-planner slash command\n├── skills/\n│   ├── issue-to-beads/        # Core workflow (7 phases)\n│   │   ├── SKILL.md\n│   │   └── references/\n│   │       └── beads-cli-reference.md\n│   ├── plan-only/             # Codebase planning without auto-execution\n│   │   └── SKILL.md\n│   └── git-push-and-tag/      # Commit, push, and label the issue\n│       └── SKILL.md\n└── .claude-plugin/\n    └── plugin.json\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n### issue-to-beads\n\nThe main workflow. Fetches a GitHub issue, creates a branch, plans the implementation, collaborates with the user on a work breakdown, files everything as beads, then pushes. Invoked by the `/beads-planner` command.\n\n### plan-only\n\nRead-only planning mode. Explores the codebase, writes a plan to `.claude/plans/<slug>.md`, presents it for approval, then stops. No code is executed. Used internally by issue-to-beads (Phase 3) but can also be triggered directly when another skill needs a plan.\n\n### git-push-and-tag\n\nFinal-phase skill that syncs beads, commits, pushes the branch, and adds a \"Ready\" label to the GitHub issue. Used internally by issue-to-beads (Phase 7) but works standalone on any issue branch with synced beads.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Conventions\n\nEvery task gets 3-5 objectively verifiable criteria. Standard criteria always included:\n\n- **\"Typecheck passes\"** — on every task\n- **\"Tests pass\"** — on tasks with testable logic\n- **\"Verify in browser\"** — on tasks that change UI\n\n## Priority Levels\n\n| Level | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| P0 | Critical — blocking production or other teams |\n| P1 | Core path — must complete for the issue to close |\n| P2 | Important but not on the critical path |\n| P3 | Nice-to-have, polish, optimization |\n"
