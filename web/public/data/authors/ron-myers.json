Based on Kim Scott's Radical Candor framework: **Care Personally + Challenge Directly**.\n\n## Overview\n\nCandid provides AI-powered code reviews that catch issues before production while teaching you better patterns. Choose between Harsh (brutal honesty) or Constructive (caring + challenging) tone. Define project-specific standards in Technical.md that get enforced automatically. Every issue comes with concrete fixes rated by confidence level.\n\n## Core Workflow\n\nThe review process follows these steps:\n\n1. Run `/candid-review` on your changes\n2. Select your preferred tone (Harsh or Constructive)\n3. Candid reviews with full architectural context\n4. Get categorized issues with actionable fixes\n5. Select which issues to track as todos\n6. Apply fixes and optionally auto-commit\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Configurable Tone** - Harsh (brutal honesty) or Constructive (caring + challenging)\n- **Technical.md Support** - Define and enforce project-specific coding standards\n- **Focus Modes** - Target reviews on security, performance, architecture, or edge cases\n- **Actionable Fixes** - Every issue includes concrete code with confidence ratings\n- **Re-Review** - Track progress on fixes across review sessions\n- **Auto-Commit** - Automatically commit applied fixes with detailed messages\n- **Todo Integration** - Convert issues to tracked todos with multi-select\n- **Issue Categorization** - Organized by severity (Critical → Architectural)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add https://github.com/ron-myers/candid\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Basic review:**\n```\n/candid-review\n```\n\n**With tone preset:**\n```\n/candid-review --harsh\n/candid-review --constructive\n```\n\n**Focus on specific aspects:**\n```\n/candid-review --focus security\n/candid-review --focus performance\n```\n\n**Auto-commit applied fixes:**\n```\n/candid-review --auto-commit\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation at [www.candid.tools](https://www.candid.tools):\n\n- **[Getting Started](https://www.candid.tools/docs/get-started)** - Installation and first review\n- **[Core Features](https://www.candid.tools/docs/core-features)** - Tone selection, focus modes, Technical.md\n- **[Team Setup](https://www.candid.tools/docs/how-to-guides/team-setup)** - Rolling out to your team\n- **[Custom Standards](https://www.candid.tools/docs/how-to-guides/custom-standards)** - Writing effective Technical.md rules\n- **[Complete Reference](https://www.candid.tools/docs/reference)** - All configuration options and flags\n- **[FAQ & Troubleshooting](https://www.candid.tools/docs/tips-troubleshooting/faq)** - Common issues and solutions\n\n## Technical.md\n\nDefine project-specific standards that Candid enforces during reviews. Violations appear as 📜 Standards Violation in your review.\n\n**Quick setup:**\n```\n/candid-init                    # Auto-generate from codebase (thorough analysis)\n/candid-init react              # React-specific standards\n/candid-init minimal            # Minimal starter\n/candid-init --effort quick     # Fast analysis (~30 sec)\n/candid-init --effort thorough  # Deep analysis (~3-5 min, default)\n```\n\n**Or copy a template:**\n```bash\ncp templates/Technical-minimal.md ./Technical.md\ncp templates/Technical-react.md ./Technical.md\ncp templates/Technical-node.md ./Technical.md\n```\n\nKeep it focused: under 500 lines, verifiable rules only. Skip what your linter handles. See the [Custom Standards guide](https://www.candid.tools/docs/how-to-guides/custom-standards) for detailed guidance.\n\n## Configuration\n\nPersist your tone preference and other settings in config files:\n\n**User-wide default:**\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.candid\necho '{\"tone\": \"harsh\"}' > ~/.candid/config.json\n```\n\n**Project-specific:**\n```bash\nmkdir -p .candid\necho '{\"tone\": \"constructive\", \"autoCommit\": true}' > .candid/config.json\n```\n\nSee the [Config Reference](https://www.candid.tools/docs/reference/config-options) for all options including `exclude` patterns, `focus` areas, and `mergeTargetBranches`.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis plugin is built on the Radical Candor principle that the best feedback:\n\n1. **Cares Personally** - Shows understanding of context and difficulty\n2. **Challenges Directly** - Doesn't hedge or soften real issues\n\nWhether you choose Harsh or Constructive tone, every review aims to find real issues before production, provide immediately applicable fixes, help you track what needs doing, and teach patterns that prevent future problems.\n\n## Updating\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin update candid@candid\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.\n\n## Links\n\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ron-myers/candid)\n- [Documentation](https://www.candid.tools)\n- [Report Issues](https://github.com/ron-myers/candid/issues)\n- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Author\n\nRon Myers\n"
