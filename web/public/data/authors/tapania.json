        "README.md": "# 5D Spec-Driven Development Skills\n\nA comprehensive suite of [Claude Code skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that implement the **5D Spec-Driven Development** methodology—a structured approach to building software that prevents wasted effort by ensuring understanding before commitment at every level.\n\n## What Are Claude Code Skills?\n\nSkills are extensions that teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable, structured way. They consist of `SKILL.md` files containing instructions and workflows that Claude follows when invoked via `/skill-name` commands.\n\n## The 5D Framework\n\nThe methodology is built on **five dimensions of thinking**:\n\n| Dimension | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Width** | Multiple domains (technical, business, user, ops, design) |\n| **Depth** | Thinking levels (reactive → dogmatic → integrative → creative) |\n| **Height** | Skill dependencies (what capabilities enable other capabilities) |\n| **Quadrants** | Four perspectives (Individual/Collective × Inner/Outer) |\n| **Time** | Evolution (\"transcend and include\" from current state) |\n\n## Skills Overview\n\n### Main Orchestrator\n\n| Skill | Command | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **5d-sdd** | `/5d-sdd` | The complete methodology. Orchestrates the full workflow across all 10 phases from orientation to reflection. Use when starting a new project or feature that needs careful planning. |\n\n### Foundational Thinking\n\n| Skill | Command | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **5d-thinking** | `/5d-thinking` | Strategic multi-dimensional thinking framework for analysis and problem-solving. Apply 5D thinking to analyze problems, generate insights, and avoid cognitive blind spots. |\n\n### The 10 Development Phases\n\n```\nUNDERSTAND          DESIGN              BUILD               LEARN\n───────────────     ───────────────     ───────────────     ───────────\n0. ORIENT           2. PLAN             6. TASKS            9. REFLECT\n1. SPAR             3. REFINE           7. BUILD\n                    4. SPEC             8. VERIFY\n                    5. GAP ANALYSIS\n```\n\n| # | Phase | Command | What Happens | Output |\n|---|-------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0 | Orient | `/5d-orient` | Map domains, surface assumptions, identify stakeholders | Orientation Summary |\n| 1 | Spar | `/5d-spar` | Challenge thinking through structured dialogue, find blind spots | SPAR Summary |\n| 2 | Plan | `/5d-plan` | Crystallize into concrete plan with assumptions made explicit | `PLAN.md` |\n| 3 | Refine | `/5d-refine` | Stress-test plan through adversarial review and edge cases | Refinement Summary |\n| 4 | Spec | `/5d-spec` | Formalize technical specification with architecture decisions | `SPEC.md` |\n| 5 | Gap Analysis | `/5d-gap-analysis` | Identify all required changes across all quadrants | Gap Analysis |\n| 6 | Tasks | `/5d-tasks` | Sequence gaps into executable, right-sized tasks | Task List |\n| 7 | Build | `/5d-build` | Implement with spec fidelity and quality awareness | Working code |\n| 8 | Verify | `/5d-verify` | Multi-layer verification (technical, spec, plan, epistemic) | Verification Report |\n| 9 | Reflect | `/5d-reflect` | Extract learning, identify process improvements | Retrospective |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nInstall directly from the Claude Code plugin marketplace:\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add tapania/5d-skills\n\n# Step 2: Install the plugin\n/plugin install 5d-skills@tapania-5d-skills\n```\n\nOr use the interactive plugin manager:\n\n```bash\n# Opens interactive UI to browse and install\n/plugin\n```\n\nThen navigate to the **Marketplaces** tab, add `tapania/5d-skills`, and install from the **Discover** tab.\n\n**Requirements:** Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (`claude --version` to check)\n\n### Option 2: Project-Level\n\nCopy the `skills/` directory to your project's `.claude/` folder:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tapania/5d-skills.git\ncp -r 5d-skills/skills/ your-project/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n### Option 3: Personal (All Projects)\n\nCopy to your personal Claude Code skills directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tapania/5d-skills.git\ncp -r 5d-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Full Workflow\n\nFor new features or projects, run phases sequentially:\n\n```\n/5d-orient → /5d-spar → /5d-plan → /5d-refine → /5d-spec → /5d-gap-analysis → /5d-tasks → /5d-build → /5d-verify → /5d-reflect\n```\n\nEach phase has exit criteria. Don't proceed until criteria are met.\n\n### Partial Workflows\n\nUse individual phases when appropriate:\n\n| Scenario | Start At |\n|----------|----------|\n| \"I have an idea, let's explore it\" | `/5d-orient` |\n| \"I know what I want, challenge my thinking\" | `/5d-spar` |\n| \"We've discussed enough, write the plan\" | `/5d-plan` |\n| \"Review this plan for issues\" | `/5d-refine` |\n| \"Turn this plan into a technical spec\" | `/5d-spec` |\n| \"What do we need to change?\" | `/5d-gap-analysis` |\n| \"Break this into tasks\" | `/5d-tasks` |\n| \"Implement this task\" | `/5d-build` |\n| \"Check if this is working\" | `/5d-verify` |\n| \"What did we learn?\" | `/5d-reflect` |\n\n### When to Skip Phases\n\n- **Trivial changes**: Skip to `/5d-build`\n- **Already planned**: Start at `/5d-spec` or `/5d-gap-analysis`\n- **Bug fixes**: Start at `/5d-build`, but run `/5d-verify` thoroughly\n- **Exploratory work**: `/5d-orient` and `/5d-spar` only\n\n**Never skip VERIFY. Always close the loop.**\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### 1. No Commitment Without Understanding\n\nEach phase deepens understanding before the next commitment:\n- ORIENT → understand the space\n- SPAR → understand objections\n- PLAN → commit to direction\n- REFINE → understand risks\n- SPEC → commit to implementation\n- BUILD → commit to code\n\n### 2. Multi-Perspective Thinking (Quadrants)\n\nEvery phase checks multiple perspectives:\n\n| Quadrant | Focus |\n|----------|-------|\n| Individual Outer | What artifacts exist? (code, components, interfaces) |\n| Individual Inner | What understanding is needed? (skills, knowledge) |\n| Collective Outer | What systems/constraints exist? (infrastructure, integrations) |\n| Collective Inner | What alignment is needed? (stakeholders, team) |\n\n### 3. Fail Fast, Route Correctly\n\nWhen something fails, return to the appropriate phase:\n\n| Failure Type | Return To |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| Code doesn't run | BUILD |\n| Works but wrong output | BUILD or SPEC |\n| Works but users confused | PLAN |\n| Solves wrong problem | SPAR or ORIENT |\n\n### 4. Identity Trap Awareness\n\n**Why thinking stops:** Latching onto ideas as identity. When identity is threatened, the mind defends rather than explores.\n\n**Counteract by:**\n- Notice when you feel defensive—probe there\n- Hold positions lightly\n- Ask: \"What would make me wrong?\"\n\n## Documents Produced\n\n- `PLAN.md` - What we're building and why\n- `SPEC.md` - How we're building it technically\n- Task list - Sequenced implementation steps\n- Verification report - What passed/failed\n- Retrospective - What we learned\n\n## Philosophy\n\nMost development failures come from:\n- Building before understanding\n- Single-perspective thinking\n- Hidden assumptions\n- Spec drift from intent\n- No feedback loops\n\n5D-SDD addresses each through structured phases with explicit exit criteria, multi-dimensional analysis, and continuous verification loops.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
