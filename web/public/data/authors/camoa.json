        "README.md": "# Claude Skills\n\nCustom plugins and tools for Claude Code.\n\n## Background\n\nI started building what I called \"frameworks\" over a year before Claude officially released Skills. Same concept, different name.\n\nThe idea came from frustration. I was tired of repeating the same instructions every conversation. Instead of starting fresh each time, I asked AI to analyze our successful interactions and create frameworks capturing recurring requirements and preferences. These became reusable project knowledge.\n\nA practical example. After tailoring several resumes and repeatedly saying \"don't embellish my experience\" or \"don't invent technologies I haven't used,\" I formalized those patterns. No more repeating corrections. The framework already contained my preferences.\n\nThis approach produced results.\n\n- 3 published Drupal contrib modules\n- 17+ blog articles\n- Automated social media campaigns generating 5-10 posts per published piece\n- Phase-based editorial workflows with database tracking\n\nWhen Claude released Skills officially, I recognized what I'd been building. This repository translates those frameworks into proper Skills with tooling.\n\nMy original frameworks were instructions and workflow patterns without embedded code. Skills add executable scripts, bundled resources, and automatic invocation. This repo bridges that gap.\n\nI wrote more about this methodology in [My Journey with AI Tools](https://adrupalcouple.us/my-journey-ai-tools-practical-tips-recent-discussion).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/camoa/claude-skills\n\n# Install individual plugins\n/plugin install plugin-creation-tools@camoa-skills\n/plugin install drupal-dev-framework@camoa-skills\n/plugin install brand-content-design@camoa-skills\n/plugin install code-quality-tools@camoa-skills\n/plugin install drupal-htmx@camoa-skills\n/plugin install code-paper-test@camoa-skills\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Skills not auto-discovered on startup\n\nThere's a [known bug in Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10113) affecting git-based marketplaces. Skills may fail to load during initialization with \"no such file or directory\" errors because Claude Code looks for skill files in the wrong location (marketplace cache instead of the git repository).\n\n**Effects:**\n- Skills won't appear in auto-discovery during plugin initialization\n- Commands and agents may have similar issues\n\n**Workaround:**\nSkills still work when invoked via the `Skill` tool (e.g., typing the skill name or using slash commands) because the SKILL.md header contains the correct path. The issue only affects automatic discovery at startup.\n\n**Status:** Awaiting fix from Anthropic.\n\n## Plugins\n\n### plugin-creation-tools (v2.2.0)\n\nComplete guide for creating Claude Code plugins.

        "drupal-dev-framework/README.md": "# Drupal Development Framework\n\nA Claude Code plugin implementing a systematic 3-phase Drupal development workflow with human control at every step.\n\n## The Problem\n\nAI coding assistants are powerful but can be unpredictable. Without structure, they might:\n- Jump straight to coding without understanding requirements\n- Miss existing solutions in contrib\n- Create inconsistent architectures\n- Implement features without tests\n\nThis plugin enforces a disciplined workflow: **Research → Architecture → Implementation**, ensuring you understand what you're building before writing code.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Projects\nA **project** is a collection of related development tasks. It might include:\n- A single Drupal module\n- Multiple related modules\n- A theme and its components\n- A mix of modules, themes, and configuration\n- Any cohesive set of development work\n\nProjects are organized by **goal**, not by file type. The plugin tracks each project in a dedicated folder with requirements, architecture documents, and implementation tasks.\n\n### Tasks\nA **task** is a single implementable unit of work (e.g., \"create settings form\", \"build entity type\"). Tasks are created after requirements gathering - you define what you want to work on, and the framework guides you through building it.\n\nEach task independently cycles through **three phases**:\n\n| Phase | Command | What Happens | Code Written? |\n|-------|---------|--------------|---------------|\n| **1. Research** | `/research <task>` | Study contrib modules, find core patterns | No |\n| **2. Architecture** | `/design <task>` | Design approach, choose patterns, set criteria | No |\n| **3. Implementation** | `/implement <task>` | Build with TDD, user approval at each step | Yes |\n\n**Key insight:** Phases apply to TASKS, not projects. A project can have multiple tasks, each at different phases. You don't write code until a task reaches Phase 3.\n\nTask files are stored in `implementation_process/in_progress/` and moved to `completed/` when done.\n\n### Memory\nThe plugin stores project state in markdown files, allowing:\n- Context restoration across Claude sessions\n- Progress tracking\n- Decision history\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **AI prepares, Human decides** - Agents gather information and present options, you make decisions\n2. **Interactive implementation** - AI writes code piece-by-piece with your approval, not autonomously\n3. **Memory-driven continuity** - Project state persists across sessions\n4. **Integration over reinvention** - Leverages existing tools (superpowers, drupal-dev-tools)\n5. **Principles are enforced, not just documented** - SOLID, TDD, DRY are checked at each phase\n\n## Built-in References\n\nThe plugin includes reference documents that are enforced at each phase:\n\n| Reference | Enforces | Phase |\n|-----------|----------|-------|\n| `references/solid-drupal.md` | SOLID principles | Design |\n| `references/library-first.md` | Library-First & CLI-First | Design |\n| `references/tdd-workflow.md` | Test-Driven Development | Implementation |\n| `references/dry-patterns.md` | Don't Repeat Yourself | Implementation |\n| `references/quality-gates.md` | 5 Quality Gates | Completion |\n| Online dev-guides | Drupal domain decisions (security, SDC, JS, forms, entities, 20+ topics) | All phases |\n\nReferences combine built-in methodology docs with [online dev-guides](https://camoa.github.io/dev-guides/) for Drupal domain knowledge.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code with [superpowers plugin](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace) installed\n- [drupal-dev-tools](https://github.com/camoa/drupal-dev-tools) plugin (optional, for DDEV integration)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace (if not already added)\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/camoa/claude-skills\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install drupal-dev-framework@camoa-skills\n```\n\n## Upgrading from v2.x\n\nv3.x uses folder-based task structure. Run `/next` after upgrading — it auto-detects and migrates old tasks. Or run `/drupal-dev-framework:migrate-tasks` manually. See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for details.\n\n## Configuration\n\nWhen you create a new project, the plugin asks where to store project files:\n\n```\nWhere should project files be stored?\n\nDefault: ../claude_projects/my_project/\n(relative to current working directory)\n\nOptions:\n1. Accept default\n2. Enter custom path\n```\n\nThe path is saved in `project_state.md`, so the plugin remembers it across sessions. You can store projects anywhere - no special folder structure required.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Starting a New Project\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create a new project\n/drupal-dev-framework:new my_project_name\n# Or interactive mode:\n/drupal-dev-framework:new\n\n# 2. Answer requirements questions (scope, integrations, constraints)\n\n# 3. Use /next to start your first task\n/drupal-dev-framework:next\n\n# 4. Enter your first task name when prompted\n#    Example: \"settings_form\" or \"content_entity\"\n\n# 5. The framework automatically starts research for your task\n```\n\n### Continuing Existing Work\n\n```bash\n# Continue where you left off\n/drupal-dev-framework:next\n\n# View project status\n/drupal-dev-framework:status\n```\n\n### Working on Tasks\n\nEach task goes through 3 phases:\n\n```bash\n# Phase 1: Research (automatic after task creation)\n# - Searches contrib modules, finds core patterns\n# - Review findings, then proceed to design\n\n# Phase 2: Design architecture\n/drupal-dev-framework:design settings_form\n\n# Phase 3: Implement with TDD\n/drupal-dev-framework:implement settings_form\n\n# Mark complete when done\n/drupal-dev-framework:complete settings_form\n\n# Start next task\n/drupal-dev-framework:research api_integration\n```\n\n### Resuming Work\n\n```bash\n# Get intelligent recommendation for next action\n/drupal-dev-framework:next\n\n# Or check current status\n/drupal-dev-framework:status\n```\n\n### Typical Session Flow\n\n```\n/next (no argument)\n     │\n     ▼\n\"Found 2 projects...\"  →  Select project\n     │\n     ▼\n\"Found 2 tasks...\"     →  Select task or create new\n     │\n     ▼\n\"Task: settings_form (Phase 2)\"\n\"Recommended: /design settings_form\"\n     │\n     ▼\nWork on task through phases → /complete when done\n     │\n     ▼\nBack to task selection\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/drupal-dev-framework:new [name]` | Start a new project with requirements gathering |\n| `/drupal-dev-framework:next [project]` | Continue existing work - select project/task and suggest next action |\n| `/drupal-dev-framework:status [project]` | Show current project state and phase |\n| `/drupal-dev-framework:research <task>` | Phase 1 - Research a task, store findings |\n| `/drupal-dev-framework:research-team <task>` | Phase 1 -

        "code-paper-test/README.md": "# Paper Test\n\nSystematically test code through mental execution - trace code line-by-line with concrete values to find bugs, logic errors, missing code, edge cases, and contract violations before deployment.\n\n## What is Paper Testing?\n\nPaper testing is the practice of mentally executing code with concrete test cases to find issues before running it. Unlike code review (which focuses on style and patterns), paper testing **actually runs** the code in your head with real values to catch:\n\n1. **Bugs** - Logic errors, null access, off-by-one errors\n2. **Missing code** - Edge cases not handled, error paths missing\n3. **Contract violations** - Mismatched interfaces, missing abstract methods\n4. **Dependency issues** - Wrong method names, incorrect return types\n\n## Why Paper Testing Now? The AI-Enabled Renaissance\n\n### Classic Era → Decline → Revival\n\n**Paper testing was effective** for simple algorithms and procedural code, but **became impractical** with:\n- External libraries (thousands of dependencies)\n- OOP complexity (inheritance, polymorphism, DI)\n- Framework magic (annotations, auto-wiring)\n- Modern scale (millions of lines)\n\n**AI changes everything** in 2025. What was impossible for humans is trivial for AI:\n\n✅ **Verify external dependencies instantly** - Check if methods exist, signatures match, return types correct\n✅ **Navigate OOP complexity** - Trace inheritance chains, verify interfaces, validate DI\n✅ **Detect AI-generated bugs** - Spot hallucinated methods, mixed API versions, wrong assumptions\n✅ **Mental execution at scale** - Follow state through complex object graphs and middleware chains\n\n### The Problem: AI Code Generation\n\nWith AI generating 30-60% of modern code:\n\n- **AI hallucinates methods** that sound right but don't exist (`$entity->getFieldValue()` → doesn't exist)\n- **Mixes API versions** (Drupal 7 patterns in D10 code)\n- **Guesses signatures** (parameter order, return types)\n- **Assumes behavior** without verification\n\n**Traditional testing can't catch these early:**\n- Unit tests only run if code compiles\n- Integration tests miss logical errors\n- Static analysis doesn't verify external dependencies\n\n**AI-powered paper testing catches them before deployment:**\n- Verifies every external call exists\n- Checks actual method signatures\n- Traces logic with concrete values\n- Validates code contracts\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugins add camoa-skills/code-paper-test\n```\n\n## When to Use\n\nThe skill is automatically invoked when you ask questions like:\n\n- \"Paper test this code\"\n- \"Trace this code\"\n- \"Test without running\"\n- \"Find bugs in this code\"\n- \"Check for edge cases\"\n- \"Validate this implementation\"\n\nOr use it explicitly:\n\n- Before deploying changes\n- Debugging without a debugger\n- Reviewing unfamiliar code\n- Auditing AI-generated code\n- Validating complex logic (loops, conditionals, recursion)\n\n### Competing Testers (Agent Team)\n\nFor complex or security-critical code, use the agent team command:\n\n```\n/code-paper:test-team src/Service/PaymentService.php\n```\n\nSpawns 3 competing testers — Happy Path Validator, Edge Case Hunter, and Red Team Attacker — who independently analyze the code and then debate findings. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe skill guides you through a systematic workflow:\n\n### 1. Define Test Scenarios\n\nPick concrete input values - happy path, edge cases, error cases.\n\n### 2. Trace Line by Line\n\nFollow each line, writing variable state after execution.\n\n### 3. Verify External Dependencies\n\nFor every external call, verify:\n- Method actually exists\n- Parameters are correct\n- Return type matches usage\n- Error cases handled\n\n### 4. Verify Code Contracts\n\nFor classes with relationships (extends, implements, uses, injects):\n- Check all abstract methods implemented\n- Verify interface signatures match\n- Confirm parent constructors called\n- Validate service dependencies exist\n\n### 5. Document Flaws\n\nReport bugs found with line numbers and fixes.\n\n## Features\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nThe main SKILL.md provides the workflow. Detailed guides in `references/`:\n\n- **core-method.md** - Complete paper testing methodology\n- **dependency-verification.md** - How to verify external calls\n- **contract-patterns.md** - All code contract verification patterns (8 types)\n- **ai-code-auditing.md** - Specific checks for AI-generated code\n- **hybrid-testing.md** - Module-level testing strategy\n- **common-flaws.md** - Catalog of frequent bugs\n- **advanced-techniques.md** - Progressive injects, red team testing, attack surface analysis, scenario-based workflows, AAR format\n\n### Contract Pattern Coverage\n\nComprehensive verification templates for:\n\n1. **Inheritance** - Abstract methods, parent calls\n2. **Plugin Systems** - Annotations, base classes, configuration\n3. **Dependency Injection** - Service existence, interfaces\n4. **Interface Implementation** - All methods, correct signatures\n5. **Traits** - Requirements, conflicts, abstract methods\n6. **Event/Hook Systems** - Signatures, return expectations\n7. **Middleware/Decorators** - Chain calls, request/response handling\n8. **Service Collectors** - Tagged services, priorities, interfaces\n\n### Hybrid Testing Strategy\n\nFor modules with multiple components:\n\n- **Flow-based testing** - Real user workflows end-to-end\n- **Component testing** - Each component with edge cases\n- **Coverage-driven** - Every component in at least one flow + edge cases\n\n## Example\n\n```php\nfunction getDiscount($total, $coupon) {\n  if ($coupon == 'SAVE10') {\n    $discount = $total * 0.10;\n  }\n  if ($coupon == 'SAVE20') {\n    $discount = $total * 0.20;\n  }\n  return $discount;\n}\n```\n\nPaper test reveals:\n\n```\nSCENARIO: No coupon provided\nINPUT: $total = 100, $coupon = null\n\nTRACE:\nLine 2: if ($coupon == 'SAVE10')\n        → null == 'SAVE10' = false\n        → SKIP\n\nLine 5: if ($coupon == 'SAVE20')\n        → null == 'SAVE20' = false\n        → SKIP\n\nLine 8: return $discount\n        → $discount is UNDEFINED\n\nFLAW FOUND:\n  Line 8: Returns undefined variable when no coupon matches\n  FIX: Initialize $discount = 0 at start of function\n```\n\n## AI Code Auditing\n\nSpecific checks for AI-generated code:\n\n- **Method existence** - AI often invents plausible method names\n- **API version mixing** - AI may use old API patterns\n- **Return type assumptions** - AI assumes convenient returns\n- **Parameter order** - AI may guess wrong order\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Find bugs before deployment** - Catch issues in development\n- **No test setup required** - Pure mental execution\n- **Works on any code** - Legacy, new, AI-generated\n- **Catches contract violations** - Verifies all relationships\n- **Fast** - Paper test in minutes vs hours of debugging\n\n## Version\n\n**0.3.0** (Current) - Competing Testers agent team command\n- `/code-paper:test-team` — 3-agent team paper testing (Happy Path + Edge Case + Red Team)\n- Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`\n\n**0.2.0** - Plugin conventions and model routing\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\ncamoa\n\n## Repository\n\nhttps://github.com/camoa/claude-skills\n",

Create an HTML design system for web pages\n```\n\n### Creating Content (repeat as needed)\n```\n/outline <template-name>  # (Optional) Get outline structure + AI prompt\n/presentation             # Create presentation from template\n/carousel                 # Create carousel from template\n/infographic              # Create infographic from template\n/html-page                # Create HTML page from design system\n/html-page-quick          # Quick HTML page creation\n```\n\n### Managing Your Brand\n```\n/brand                    # Check status, switch projects\n/brand-assets             # Add/update logos, fonts after setup\n/brand-palette            # Generate new color palettes anytime\n```\n\n## Workflow (Detailed)\n\n### 1. Initialize a Project\n\n```\n/brand-init\n```\n\nCreates a project folder with this structure:\n```\n{brand-name}/\n├── brand-philosophy.md   # Your brand's visual & verbal DNA\n├── assets/               # Processed assets ready for use\n├── templates/\n│   ├── presentations/    # Reusable presentation templates\n│   ├── carousels/        # Reusable carousel templates\n│   ├── infographics/     # Reusable infographic templates\n│   └── html/             # HTML design systems (with component libraries)\n├── presentations/        # Generated presentations\n├── carousels/            # Generated carousels\n├── infographics/         # Generated infographics\n├── html-pages/           # Generated HTML pages\n└── input/                # Source files\n    ├── logos/            # Logo files (SVG, PNG, AI, EPS)\n    ├── icons/            # Icon sets, favicons\n    ├── images/           # Brand photography, illustrations\n    ├── fonts/            # Custom font files\n    ├── screenshots/      # For brand analysis\n    └── documents/        # For brand analysis\n```\n\n### 2. Extract Brand Philosophy\n\n```\n/brand-extract\n```\n\nAnalyzes your brand from multiple sources:\n- **Files** in `input/` folder (screenshots, PDFs, logos)\n- **Website URL** - paste your site to analyze\n- **Verbal description** - describe your brand in chat\n- **Existing guidelines** - paste brand docs directly\n\nGenerates `brand-philosophy.md` with your visual identity, voice, and core principles.\n\n### 3. Create Templates (Required before creating content)\n\n```\n/template-presentation    # Guided wizard for presentation templates\n/template-carousel        # Guided wizard for carousel templates\n/template-infographic     # Guided wizard for infographic templates\n```\n\nTemplates define:\n- Slide/card/infographic structure and sequence\n- Visual style (from 13 styles across 4 aesthetic families for presentations/carousels)\n- Color palette (brand colors or saved alternative palette)\n- Visual design philosophy (canvas-philosophy.md)\n- Sample PPTX/PDF/PNG for reference\n\n**You need at least one template before you can create content.**\n\n### 4. Prepare Content with Outline (Optional)\n\n```\n/outline <template-name>  # Get outline template + AI prompt\n```\n\nGenerates two files for your template:\n- **outline-template.md** - Fill-in-the-blank structure matching your slides/cards\n- **outline-prompt.txt** - Prompt to use in Claude Projects or any AI chat\n  - Includes slide/card type definitions (purpose, content requirements, word limits)\n  - External AI will understand exactly what each slide/card type needs\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Run `/outline my-template` to get the prompt\n2. Open Claude Projects (or any AI) where you have your content/context\n3. Paste the `outline-prompt.txt` content\n4. Add your raw content where indicated (`[PASTE YOUR CONTENT HERE]`)\n5. AI returns a structured outline matching your template's slide/card sequence\n6. Copy the AI's output\n7. Run `/presentation` or `/carousel`, select your template\n8. Paste the structured outline when asked for content\n\n**Why this works:** The prompt teaches the external AI your template's exact structure and constraints, so its output maps perfectly to `/presentation` or `/carousel`.\n\n### 5. Create Content (using your templates)\n\n**Guided mode** (step-by-step):\n```\n/presentation             # Select template, provide content\n/carousel                 # Select template, provide content\n/infographic              # Select template, provide content\n```\n\n**Quick mode** (paste and go):\n```\n/presentation-quick       # Select template, paste content\n/carousel-quick           # Select template, paste content\n/infographic-quick        # Select template, paste content\n```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/brand` | Main entry -

available based on your chosen style:\n\n| Component | Description | Supported Styles |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Cards** | Rounded containers for content grouping | Dramatic, Organic, Hygge, Memphis, Feng Shui, Iki, Lagom, Swiss |\n| **Icons** | 1900+ Lucide icons for visual accents | Dramatic, Organic, Hygge, Memphis, Feng Shui, Iki, Lagom, Swiss |\n| **Gradients** | Linear/radial backgrounds for depth | Dramatic, Organic, Hygge, Memphis, Feng Shui |\n\n### Component Support by Style\n\n| Style | Cards | Icons | Gradients |\n|-------|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|\n| Dramatic | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Organic | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Hygge | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Memphis | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Feng Shui | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Iki | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |\n| Lagom | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |\n| Swiss | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |\n| Minimal | ◐ | ✗ | ✗ |\n| Wabi-Sabi | ◐ | ✗ | ✗ |\n| Shibui | ◐ | ✗ | ✗ |\n| Ma | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |\n| Yeo-baek | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |\n\n**◐** = Subtle/limited support (border-only cards)\n\nWhen creating templates with `/template-carousel` or `/template-presentation`, you'll be asked which visual components to enable based on your selected style.\n\n## Color Palette System\n\nGenerate alternative color palettes from your brand colors:\n\n```\n/brand-palette\n```\n\nChoose between two approaches:\n\n### Derived Palettes (Color Theory)\n\nMathematical derivations from your brand colors. Select which source colors to use:\n- **Primary only** - Generate from main brand color\n- **All brand colors** - Generate from each color, combine results\n- **Pick specific** - Choose which colors to use\n\n#### Harmony-Based (Color Wheel)\n| Type | Description | Use Case |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Monochromatic** | Single hue, varying lightness | Safe, cohesive |\n| **Analogous** | Adjacent colors | Harmonious, comfortable |\n| **Complementary** | Opposite colors | High contrast, CTAs |\n| **Split-Complementary** | Base + two adjacent to complement | Contrast with less tension |\n| **Triadic** | Three equally spaced | Balanced, vibrant |\n| **Tetradic** | Four colors (rectangle) | Rich, complex |\n\n#### Tonal Variations\n| Type | Description | Use Case |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Tints** | Source + white | Soft backgrounds |\n| **Shades** | Source + black | Bold emphasis |\n| **Tones** | Source + gray | Sophisticated, subtle |\n| **Interpolation** | Gradients between source colors | Data viz, smooth transitions |\n\n### Alternative Palettes (Mood-Based)\n\nCompletely different colors that maintain your brand's feeling. Transforms your **entire palette**:\n\n| Type | Description | Use Case |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Pastel** | Lighten + desaturate | Gentle campaigns |\n| **Bold** | High saturation, strong contrast | Impact, announcements |\n| **Earthy** | Natural equivalents | Sustainable, authentic |\n| **Vibrant** | Bright, saturated | Youth, energy |\n| **Muted** | Desaturated, refined | Luxury, sophistication |\n| **Monochrome** | Grayscale + one accent | Editorial, dramatic |\n| **Custom** | Describe a mood | Seasonal campaigns |\n\n**17 palette types total** (10 derived + 7 alternative). Generated palettes are saved to `brand-philosophy.md` for use in content creation.\n\n## Infographic System\n\nCreate data visualizations, process diagrams, timelines, and comparisons using **114 built-in templates** powered by @antv/infographic.\n\n### Template Categories\n\n| Category | Templates | Use Cases |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Sequence** | 43 | Timelines, steps, processes, roadmaps, flows |\n| **List** | 23 | Tips, features, grids, pyramids, sectors |\n| **Hierarchy** | 25 | Org charts, tree structures, taxonomies |\n| **Compare** | 17 | VS, before/after, pros/cons, SWOT |\n| **Quadrant** | 3 | 2x2 matrices, priority grids |\n| **Relation** | 2 | Networks, circular connections |\n| **Chart** | 1 | Statistics, metrics, bar charts |\n\n### Template Asset Types\n\nTemplates come in three varieties based on visual assets:\n\n| Type | Identifier | Description | Complexity |\n|------|------------|-------------|------------|\n| **Text-only** | (default) | Labels and descriptions only | Easiest - just provide content |\n| **Icon-based** | `icon` in name | Uses icon syntax `icon:rocket` | Medium - choose from icon library |\n| **Illustrated** | `-illus` suffix | Requires custom SVG illustrations | Advanced - create SVGs per item |\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Start with **text-only** templates (100+ options)\n- Use **icon-based** for visual appeal without custom art (8 templates)\n- Use **illustrated** only when you have custom SVG assets (9 templates)\n\n### Text Guidelines (Avoiding Overlap)\n\nInfographic templates have limited space. Follow these guidelines:\n\n| Element | Max Length | Example |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| **Labels** | 1-2 words | \"Cloud\", \"Security\" |\n| **Descriptions** | 2-4 words | \"Infrastructure design\" |\n| **Title** | 3-5 words | \"Our Services\" |\n\nIf content is longer:\n1. Use a template with more space (grid vs row)\n2. Increase canvas width (1200px+)\n3. Use column/done-list templates (more vertical space)\n\n### Background Presets\n\n| Preset | Effect | Best For |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| `solid` | Clean solid color | Minimalist |\n| `spotlight` | Radial gradient from center | Focus emphasis |\n| `spotlight-dots` | Gradient + dot pattern | Modern tech |\n| `spotlight-grid` | Gradient + grid overlay | Technical |\n| `tech-matrix` | Tech-style gradient + grid | Data/engineering |\n| `diagonal-crosshatch` | Diagonal gradient + crosshatch | Creative |\n\n### Infographic Workflow\n\n```\n1. /template-infographic    # Choose category → design → style → save template\n2. /infographic             # Select template → provide content → generate PNG/SVG\n```\n\nOr quick mode:\n```\n/infographic-quick          # Select template → paste content → get PNG\n```\n\n### Output Specifications\n\n- **Dimensions**: Configurable (default 1920x1080 for slides, 1080x1080 for social)\n- **Formats**: PNG (recommended), SVG (vector)\n- **Location**: `infographics/{date}-{name}/`\n\n## HTML Design System\n\nCreate branded HTML pages using a **design-system-based** approach. Unlike templates (fixed structure → fill content), a design system defines visual identity + reusable components → compose unlimited page types.\n\n### Key Differences from Presentations/Carousels\n\n| Aspect | Presentation/Carousel | HTML Pages |\n|--------|----------------------|------------|\n| Structure | Fixed slide/card sequence | Flexible component selection |\n| Reuse | One template → one structure | One design system → unlimited pages |\n| Output | PDF / PPTX | Single standalone `.html` file |\n| Growth | Static templates | Component library grows over time |\n\n### How It Works\n\n```\n1. /design-html         # Create a design system (tokens + component catalog)\n2. /html-page           # Select components, provide content, generate page\n3. Components saved     # Each new component added to library for reuse\n4. Next page            # Reuse existing components + generate new ones\n```\n\n### Output Format\n\nSingle standalone `.html` file with:\n- Embedded CSS (no external stylesheets)\n- CSS custom properties for brand tokens\n- Mobile-first responsive (375px → 768px → 1200px)\n- CSS-first interactivity + minimal vanilla JS when needed\n- WCAG AA accessibility\n- Google Fonts with system font fallbacks\n- Convertibility-ready structure (prop/slot metadata for future SDC, React, etc.)\n\n### 15 Component Types\n\nNavigation, Hero, Feature Grid, Content Block, Testimonials, CTA, Stats Bar, Team Grid, FAQ Accordion, Pricing Cards, Gallery, Process Steps, Contact, Footer, Logo Bar — each with multiple variants.\n\n### 10 Page Category Presets\n\nLanding Page, About/Company, Portfolio, Event, Pricing, Blog/Article, Documentation, Coming Soon, Contact, Custom.\n\n## Three-Layer Philosophy System\n\n```\nLayer 1: BRAND PHILOSOPHY (brand-philosophy.md)\n├── Visual DNA: colors, typography, imagery style\n├── Verbal DNA: voice, tone, vocabulary\n└── Core Principles: always/never rules\n\nLayer 2: CONTENT TYPE GUIDES (plugin references)\n├── Presentation Zen principles\n├── Carousel best practices\n├── 13 visual styles with constraints\n└── Automatically updated with plugin\n\nLayer 3: TEMPLATE + CANVAS PHILOSOPHY (per template)\n├── template.md: structure, slide sequence\n├── canvas-philosophy.md: visual design philosophy + style constraints\n└── sample.pdf: visual reference\n```\n\n## Output Specifications\n\n### Presentations\n- Dimensions: 1920x1080 (16:9)\n- Format: PDF + PPTX\n- Location: `presentations/{date}-{name}/`\n\n### LinkedIn Carousels\n- Dimensions: 1080x1350 (4:5 portrait)\n- Format: Multi-page PDF\n- Location: `carousels/{date}-{name}/`\n\n### Instagram Carousels\n- Dimensions: 1080x1080 (1:1 square)\n- Format: PDF or PNG sequence\n\n## Accessibility & Quality Enforcement\n\nAll generated content automatically enforces:\n\n| Check | Standard | Action |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| **Contrast ratio** | WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum) | Auto-fixes with safe colors |\n| **No text overlap** | Elements never collide | Validates bounding boxes |\n| **Safe zones** | 50px presentations, 5% carousels | Enforces margins |\n| **Gradient text** | Readable at both ends | Validates contrast range |\n| **Word limits** | Per style constraints | Prevents text walls |\n\n**Logo format**: PNG or JPG only (SVG auto-converted during `/brand-extract`)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis plugin uses these skills for visual output:\n\n| Skill | Purpose | Status |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| **visual-content** | Generate presentations/carousels from canvas philosophy | Bundled (no install needed) |\n| **infographic-generator** | Generate infographics from @antv/infographic | Bundled (no install needed) |\n| **html-generator** | Generate HTML pages and components from design system | Bundled (no install needed) |\n| **pptx** | Convert PDF to editable PowerPoint | Built-in (Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise) |\n| **pdf** | Create multi-page PDFs | Built-in (Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise) |\n\nThe `visual-content` skill is bundled with this plugin - it uses artistic philosophy language to create museum-quality visual output following your brand and template constraints.\n\nThe `infographic-generator` skill provides 114 data visualization templates with brand theming and custom backgrounds.\n\nThe `html-generator` skill creates standalone HTML components and composed pages using design tokens, responsive CSS, and WCAG AA accessibility.\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Start with `/brand`** - it adapts to your context\n- **Templates are required** - create at least one before making content\n- **One template, many outputs** - create a template once, use it for dozens of presentations/carousels\n- **Use `/outline`** - helps structure your content to match the template\n- **Quick mode** for rapid iteration, **guided mode** for important pieces\n- **Brand philosophy evolves** - re-run `/brand-extract` as your brand matures\n"
