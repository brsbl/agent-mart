It combats **Context Rot**—the phenomenon where LLM performance degrades as context fills—through persistent artifacts and filesystem-based memory.\n\n> **Note:** You do NOT need Python installed to use Jerry. The plugin runs within Claude Code using its built-in capabilities. Python is only required if you want to contribute to Jerry's development.\n\n> \"The effective context window where models perform optimally is often <256k tokens, far below advertised limits.\"\n> — [Chroma Research](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) installed and configured\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management (required for hooks)\n\n### Installation\n\nJerry is installed via a **local marketplace**. Choose your platform:\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install uv (if not already installed)\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# 2. Clone Jerry to a local directory\nmkdir -p ~/plugins\ngit clone https://github.com/geekatron/jerry.git ~/plugins/jerry\n\n# 3. In Claude Code, add the local marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add ~/plugins/jerry\n\n# 4. Install the Jerry plugin\n/plugin install jerry@jerry-framework\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Windows (PowerShell)</strong></summary>\n\n```powershell\n# 1. Install uv (if not already installed)\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n\n# 2. Restart your terminal to update PATH, then verify\nuv --version\n\n# 3. Clone Jerry to a local directory\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\plugins\"\ngit clone https://github.com/geekatron/jerry.git \"$env:USERPROFILE\\plugins\\jerry\"\n\n# 4. In Claude Code, add the local marketplace (use forward slashes)\n/plugin marketplace add C:/Users/$env:USERNAME/plugins/jerry\n\n# 5. Install the Jerry plugin\n/plugin install jerry@jerry-framework\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, run `/plugin` in Claude Code and check the **Installed** tab. You should see `jerry` listed.\n\nSee [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.\n\n## Platform Support\n\nJerry is **primarily developed and tested on macOS**. We are actively working on cross-platform portability, with Windows support as the immediate priority.\n\n| Platform | Status |\n|----------|--------|\n| **macOS** | Primary — fully supported |\n| **Linux** | Expected to work — not regularly tested |\n| **Windows** | In progress — core functionality works, edge cases may exist |\n\n**Encountering a platform-specific issue?** File a report using the template for your platform:\n\n- [macOS issue](https://github.com/geekatron/jerry/issues/new?template=macos-compatibility.yml)\n- [Linux issue](https://github.com/geekatron/jerry/issues/new?template=linux-compatibility.yml)\n- [Windows issue](https://github.com/geekatron/jerry/issues/new?template=windows-compatibility.yml)\n\nYour reports directly drive portability improvements.\n\n> Jerry's CI pipeline tests on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for platform-specific development notes.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Skill and agent definitions are not yet optimized.** Current definitions are comprehensive but verbose. Optimization for token efficiency and best-practice alignment is on the roadmap for upcoming releases.\n- **Windows portability is in progress.** Some hooks and scripts may behave differently on Windows. See [Platform Support](#platform-support) above.\n\n## Using Jerry\n\nJerry provides **skills**—natural language interfaces you invoke with slash commands:\n\n| Skill | Purpose | Example |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| `/problem-solving` | Research, analysis, root cause investigation | \"Research OAuth2 patterns\" |\n| `/worktracker` | Task and work item management | \"Create a task for login feature\" |\n| `/nasa-se` | Systems engineering (NPR 7123.1D) | \"Define requirements for API\" |\n| `/orchestration` | Multi-phase workflow coordination | \"Orchestrate the release pipeline\" |\n| `/architecture` | Design decisions and ADRs | \"Create ADR for caching strategy\" |\n| `/transcript` | Meeting transcript parsing | \"Parse the meeting notes\" |\n\n### Example Session\n\n```\nYou: /problem-solving analyze why the tests are failing\n\nClaude: I'll invoke the ps-analyst agent to investigate...\n        [Creates persistent analysis artifact]\n\n        Root cause identified: Missing mock for external API call in\n        test_auth_service.py:45. The test expects a response object\n        but receives None.\n\n        Analysis saved to: docs/analysis/EN-001-e-001-test-failures.md\n```\n\nAll outputs are **persisted to files**, surviving context compaction and building your project's knowledge base.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Structured Problem-Solving**: 8 specialized agents (researcher, analyst, architect, validator, synthesizer, reviewer, investigator, reporter)\n- **Work Tracking**: Local task management with status, priorities, and dependencies\n- **Knowledge Accrual**: Persistent artifacts in `docs/` that survive session boundaries\n- **NASA Systems Engineering**: NPR 7123.1D processes for mission-grade rigor\n- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate complex workflows with checkpointing\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) | Detailed setup instructions for all platforms |\n| [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | Context for Claude Code sessions |\n| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Registry of available agents |\n| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | How to contribute to Jerry development |\n\n## For Contributors\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and contribution guidelines.\n\nQuick development setup:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/geekatron/jerry.git\ncd jerry\nuv sync\nuv run pytest\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Claude Code Plugin Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins)\n- Cockburn, A.
