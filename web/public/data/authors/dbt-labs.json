        "README.md": "# dbt Agent Skills\n\nA curated collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for working with dbt. These skills help AI agents understand and execute dbt workflows more effectively.\n\n## What are Agent Skills?\n\nAgent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently.\n\n## How They Work\n\nThese skills are **not** slash commands or user-invoked actions. Once installed, the agent automatically loads the relevant skill when your prompt matches its use case. Just describe what you need in natural language and the agent handles the rest. See [skill invocation control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#control-who-invokes-a-skill) for more details.\n\n## What's Included\n\n- **Analytics engineering**: Build and modify dbt models, write tests, explore data sources\n- **Semantic layer**: Create metrics, dimensions, and semantic models with MetricFlow\n- **Platform operations**: Troubleshoot job failures, configure the dbt MCP server\n- **Migration**: Move projects from dbt Core to the Fusion engine\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nAdd the dbt skills marketplace and install the plugins:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills\n\n# Install the dbt skills (analytics engineering, semantic layer, testing, etc.)\n/plugin install dbt@dbt-agent-marketplace\n\n# Install the migration skills (typically a one-off — not needed for every session)\n/plugin install dbt-migration@dbt-agent-marketplace\n```\n\n### Other AI Clients\n\nUse the [Vercel Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills from this repository.\n\n```bash\n# Preview available skills\nnpx skills add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills --list\n\n# Install all skills\nnpx skills add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills\n\n# Install only the dbt skills (analytics engineering, semantic layer, etc.)\nnpx skills add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills/skills/dbt\n\n# Install only the migration skills\nnpx skills add  dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills/skills/dbt-migration\n\n# Install a specific skill\nnpx skills add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills --skill using-dbt-for-analytics-engineering\n\n# Install globally (available in all projects, stored in ~/.<agent>/skills/)\nnpx skills add dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills --global\n\n# Check for updates\nnpx skills check\n\n# Update installed skills\nnpx skills update\n```\n\nThe Vercel Skills CLI supports 30+ AI agents including Cursor, Cline, GitHub Copilot, and others.\n\n### Compatible Agents\n\nThese skills work with AI agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) format.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### dbt (analytics engineering)\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `using-dbt-for-analytics-engineering` | Build and modify dbt models, debug errors, explore data sources, write tests |\n| `adding-dbt-unit-test` | Add unit tests for dbt models, practice test-driven development |\n| `building-dbt-semantic-layer` | Create semantic models, metrics, and dimensions with MetricFlow |\n| `answering-natural-language-questions-with-dbt` | Answer business questions by querying the semantic layer |\n| `troubleshooting-dbt-job-errors` | Diagnose and resolve dbt platform job failures |\n| `configuring-dbt-mcp-server` | Set up the dbt MCP server for Claude, Cursor, or VS Code |\n| `fetching-dbt-docs` | Look up dbt documentation efficiently |\n| `running-dbt-commands` | Run dbt CLI commands with correct flags, selectors, and parameter formats |\n\n### dbt-migration (one-off use)\n\nThese skills are typically used once during a migration project rather than in every agent session.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `migrating-dbt-core-to-fusion` | Migrate dbt projects from dbt Core to the Fusion engine |\n| `migrating-dbt-project-across-platforms` | Migrate dbt projects across data platforms |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nMost skills assume:\n\n- dbt is installed and configured\n- A dbt project with `dbt_project.yml` exists\n- Basic familiarity with dbt concepts (models, tests, sources)\n\nSome skills like `fetching-dbt-docs` and `configuring-dbt-mcp-server` can be used without an existing project.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions! Whether you want to add a new dbt skill, improve existing ones, or fix issues, please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Format Specification\n\nAll skills in this repository follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) to ensure compatibility across different agent products.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [dbt Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/)\n- [dbt CLI Reference](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-commands)\n- [Agent Skills Documentation](https://agentskills.io/home)\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)\n\n## Community\n\n- **Issues**: Report problems or suggest new skills\n- **Discussions**: Share use cases and patterns\n- **Pull Requests**: Contribute new skills or improvements\n- **Star** this repository if you find it useful!\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Skill Evaluation\n\nSee [evals/README.md](evals/README.md) for the A/B testing tool to compare skill variations.\n"
