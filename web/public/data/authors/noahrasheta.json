        "README.md": "# Director\n\n**Spec-driven orchestration for vibe coders and solo entrepreneurs.**\n\nDirector is a Claude Code plugin for solo builders who use AI to build software. It guides the entire process -- from capturing your vision, to researching your domain, to planning your build, to verifying it works. You think about what to build; Director handles the how.\n\n## Install\n\nRequires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) v1.0.33 or later.\n\n### Quick Install\n\nIn Claude Code, run these two commands:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add noahrasheta/director\n/plugin install director@director-marketplace\n```\n\nThen run `/director:onboard` to get started.\n\n## What Director Does\n\nDirector follows a three-part loop:\n\n- **Blueprint** -- Capture your vision and create a gameplan (goals, steps, and tasks). Director researches your domain and analyzes your codebase to make informed plans.\n- **Build** -- Execute tasks one at a time with fresh AI context loaded with relevant research and codebase knowledge, so quality stays high.\n- **Inspect** -- Verify that what you built actually works the way you intended.\n\nEach task gets a fresh AI workspace loaded with just the context it needs -- including codebase conventions, architecture patterns, and domain research. This keeps things fast, accurate, and focused.\n\n## Deep Context\n\nDirector doesn't just plan blindly. During onboarding, it builds deep understanding of your project:\n\n- **Codebase mapping** -- 4 parallel agents analyze your existing code, producing detailed files covering your stack, architecture, conventions, structure, testing patterns, integrations, and concerns. These files guide every downstream agent so they follow your project's patterns.\n- **Domain research** -- 4 parallel researchers investigate your project's ecosystem (stack choices, feature patterns, architecture approaches, common pitfalls) and produce actionable recommendations with a \"Don't Hand-Roll\" list of problems with existing library solutions.\n- **Step-level research** -- Before planning tasks within each step, a researcher investigates the specific technical domain so task plans are informed by current ecosystem knowledge.\n- **Staleness detection** -- Director alerts you when your codebase or research context is outdated and suggests running `/director:refresh` to update it.\n\nAll of this context flows into Blueprint, Build, Brainstorm, Pivot, and Inspect -- so every agent makes context-informed decisions.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Blueprint -- Plan Your Project\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/director:onboard` | Set up a new project or map an existing one. Director maps your codebase, asks you a few questions, optionally researches your domain, then creates a plan. |\n| `/director:blueprint` | Create, view, or update your gameplan. Use this to add new goals, rearrange steps, or see the big picture. |\n\n**Examples:**\n```\n/director:onboard\n/director:blueprint \"add payment processing\"\n```\n\n### Build -- Make Progress\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/director:build` | Work on the next ready task. Director picks what to do next, loads relevant codebase context, and gets to work. |\n| `/director:quick \"...\"` | Make a fast change without full planning. Good for small tweaks that don't need a whole task. |\n\n**Examples:**\n```\n/director:build\n/director:quick \"change the button color to blue\"\n```\n\n### Inspect -- Check Your Work\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/director:inspect` | Verify that what was built actually matches the goal. Director checks outcomes, not just task completion, using your project's conventions. |\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/director:inspect\n```\n\n### Other\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/director:status` | See where you are -- current goal, progress, and what's next. |\n| `/director:resume` | Pick up where you left off after a break. Director restores your context. |\n| `/director:refresh` | Re-scan your codebase and optionally re-run domain research without full re-onboarding. Shows what changed since the last scan. |\n| `/director:brainstorm` | Think out loud with full project context, including research and codebase knowledge. |\n| `/director:pivot` | Handle a change in direction. When requirements shift, Director helps you adjust the plan without starting over. |\n| `/director:idea \"...\"` | Capture an idea for later. It gets saved so nothing is lost, even if now is not the right time. |\n| `/director:ideas` | Review your saved ideas. Pick one to build, add to the gameplan, or discard. |\n| `/director:undo` | Go back to before the last task. Reverts the most recent change Director made. |\n| `/director:help` | Show all available commands with examples and your current project status. |\n\n**Examples:**\n```\n/director:status\n/director:resume\n/director:refresh\n/director:refresh research\n/director:brainstorm \"what about real-time collaboration?\"\n/director:pivot\n/director:idea \"add dark mode\"\n/director:ideas\n/director:undo\n/director:help\n```\n\n## What Director Creates\n\nWhen you first run a Director command, it creates a `.director/` folder in your project with:\n\n- **VISION.md** -- What you want to build (captured during onboard)\n- **GAMEPLAN.md** -- Your goals, steps, and tasks\n- **STATE.md** -- Where you are in the build\n- **IDEAS.md** -- Ideas you have captured for later\n- **config.json** -- Settings (sensible defaults, no editing needed)\n- **codebase/** -- Technical analysis of your existing code (stack, architecture, conventions, structure, testing, integrations, concerns)\n- **research/** -- Domain research for your project (stack choices, features, architecture, pitfalls, summary)\n\nYou never need to edit these files directly. Director manages them for you.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v1.0.33 or later\n- A project you want to build (new or existing)\n\n**Note:** Director's research features (domain analysis during `/director:onboard` and `/director:refresh`) use Claude Code's built-in WebFetch tool to look up documentation and best practices. If WebFetch is unavailable in your environment, research will degrade gracefully -- Director will still work, but research summaries may be less detailed.\n\n## Links\n\n- **Website:** [director.cc](https://director.cc)\n- **Source:** [github.com/noahrasheta/director](https://github.com/noahrasheta/director)\n- **License:** MIT\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

I build Claude Code plugins, skills, and agents to automate the things I do repeatedly. This repo is where all of that lives -- open source, for anyone to use, fork, or build on.\n\nThe stuff here spans many domains because my work does too. Data infrastructure, automations, prompt engineering, content workflows, and whatever I'm tinkering with next.

Invoke `/create-image` and a team of specialized agents handles the rest -- from analyzing reference images to generating 5 variants and ranking them.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Asks structured clarifying questions about what you want (subject, style, mood, aspect ratio, resolution, reference images, etc.)\n- Spawns 4 agents in a sequential pipeline: Research Agent, Prompt Architect, Generator Agent, Critic Agent\n- Generates 5 image variants (Faithful, Enhanced, Alt Composition, Style Variation, Bold/Creative)\n- Critiques each image on 4 dimensions from the PaperBanana paper (Faithfulness, Readability, Conciseness, Aesthetics)\n- Presents ranked results with a top recommendation and offers iteration\n\n**Based on:** [PaperBanana](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23265) (Google Cloud AI Research & Peking University) -- a multi-agent framework that outperforms single-shot image generation by +17% overall.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n```bash\npip install google-genai Pillow python-dotenv\n```\n\nAdd your Gemini API key to a `.env` file in the project where you'll run the plugin:\n```\nGEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here\n```\n\nGet an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/create-image\n```\n\nOr with an initial description:\n```\n/create-image an infographic about global coffee consumption in the style of Visual Capitalist\n```\n\nGenerated images are saved to a `shipfast-images/` folder in your project directory for easy access.\n\n**Status:** v0.1.0 -- initial release. Core pipeline functional.\n\n---\n\n### dc-due-diligence\n\nAutomated due diligence for data center site opportunities. Point it at a folder of broker documents (PDFs, spreadsheets, Word docs, PowerPoint decks, images) and it runs a full analysis across 9 domains, synthesizes cross-domain risks, and produces a scored executive summary with a **Pursue / Proceed with Caution / Pass** verdict.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Converts all documents in the folder to markdown (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, images via vision API)\n- Spawns 9 domain research agents in parallel, each analyzing the converted documents and conducting independent web research to verify broker claims:\n  - **Power** -- utility interconnection, grid capacity, substation, redundancy design\n  - **Connectivity** -- fiber carriers, route diversity, carrier neutrality\n  - **Water & Cooling** -- water supply, cooling system design, scarcity risk\n  - **Land, Zoning & Entitlements** -- zoning compliance, permits, building readiness\n  - **Ownership & Control** -- property ownership verification, middleman detection, litigation\n  - **Environmental** -- natural hazards, contamination, Phase I ESA status\n  - **Commercials** -- deal terms, land cost, power rates, lease structure\n  - **Natural Gas** -- pipeline access, on-site generation feasibility, permitting\n  - **Market Comparables** -- comparable transactions, market rates, competition\n- Runs a **Risk Assessment** agent that reads all 9 domain reports and identifies cross-cutting risks, deal-breakers, and compound risks\n- Generates an **Executive Summary** that scores each category (High / Medium / Low), applies a tiered verdict system, and delivers a stakeholder-ready report\n\n**Output:**\n- `<folder>/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` -- scored summary with verdict, strengths, concerns, deal-breakers, and next steps\n- `<folder>/research/*.md` -- 10 detailed research reports (one per domain + risk assessment)\n\n#### Installation\n\n**Step 1: Add the marketplace and install the plugin**\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add noahrasheta/shipfast\n/plugin install dc-due-diligence@shipfast\n```\n\nPython 3.11+ is required on your machine. The plugin automatically sets up its Python virtual environment the first time you run `/due-diligence` -- no manual setup step needed.\n\n**Step 2 (only if your folder has images or scanned PDFs): Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**\n\nThe document converter uses the Anthropic API directly to extract text from images and scanned PDFs via Claude's vision capability. This runs as a Python subprocess, separate from Claude Code itself, so it needs its own API key.\n\nAdd to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):\n```bash\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here\n```\n\nThen **restart Claude Code** so it picks up the new variable. Environment variables are inherited at launch time -- adding the key while Claude Code is running won't take effect until you restart it.\n\nIf your folder only contains native PDFs, Word docs, Excel files, and PowerPoint decks, you do not need this -- those formats are converted using local Python libraries with no API calls.\n\n#### How web research works\n\nThe 12 research agents verify broker claims using web research. There are two layers, and the baseline works with zero configuration:\n\n**Baseline (always available):** Agents use Claude Code's built-in `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools. These work automatically -- no API keys or setup needed.\n\n**Enhanced (optional):** If you have Tavily, Exa, or Firecrawl configured as MCP servers in Claude Code, agents will automatically detect and use them via `ToolSearch` for deeper search capabilities. This is a nice-to-have, not a requirement.\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n/due-diligence ./path/to/opportunity-folder\n```\n\nThe folder should contain the broker-provided documents for the opportunity. The plugin handles conversion, analysis, and reporting end to end.\n\n**Status:** v0.1.0 -- initial release. Full pipeline functional with 12 agents, document conversion, and web research verification.\n\n---\n\n## Links\n\n- **Marketplace:** [shipfast.cc](https://shipfast.cc)\n- **Personal site:** [noahrasheta.com](https://noahrasheta.com)\n- **GitHub:** [github.com/noahrasheta/shipfast](https://github.com/noahrasheta/shipfast)\n\n## License\n\nMIT -- see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n",
