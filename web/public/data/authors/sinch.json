        "README.md": "# Sinch Plugins\n\nThis repository contains Sinch plugins and related artifacts for AI developer tools.\n\n## Claude Code\n\nA Claude Code plugin that integrates the Sinch Conversation API, allowing you to send SMS messages, manage webhooks, and inspect your Sinch configuration directly from your terminal.\n\n### Features\n\n- **Send Messages**: Send text messages via SMS.\n- **Manage Webhooks**: Create, list, update, and delete webhooks for your Conversation API app.\n- **List Senders**: View active phone numbers and senders.\n- **MCP Integration**: Built on top of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) installed.\n- A [Sinch Customer Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/) account.\n- A Conversation API app with credentials (Project ID, Key ID, Key Secret, App ID, App Region).\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install this plugin in Claude Code, you typically install it from a marketplace or a local source.\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sinch/sinch-plugins.git\n/plugin install sinch-claude-plugin\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThis plugin relies on the Sinch MCP server, which requires specific environment variables to authenticate with the Sinch API. These variables must be set in your Claude Code settings.\n\n### Required Environment Variables\n\nYou need to configure the following variables:\n\n- `CONVERSATION_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sinch Project ID.\n- `CONVERSATION_KEY_ID`: Your Access Key ID.\n- `CONVERSATION_KEY_SECRET`: Your Access Key Secret.\n- `CONVERSATION_REGION`: The region for your app (e.g., `us`, `eu`, `br`).\n- `CONVERSATION_APP_ID`: The specific Conversation App ID you want to use.\n\n### Get Your Sinch Credentials\n\nGet access and create your access key: You will need a Sinch Build account ([see here for instructions on setting up an account](https://community.sinch.com/t5/Build-Dashboard/How-to-sign-up-for-your-free-Sinch-account/ta-p/8058)). Once you have created an account and logged in, select [Conversation API](https://dashboard.sinch.com/convapi/overview) from the left menu. Review the terms and conditions, select the I agree to the terms and conditions check box, and click GET ACCESS to proceed.\nThen, create your access key. Access keys are used to authenticate calls when using Conversation API. Access keys are generated in the [Sinch Build Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys). If you need assistance, you can [review our Community article on access key creation](https://community.sinch.com/t5/Conversation-API/How-to-get-your-access-key-for-Conversation-API/ta-p/8120).\n\n### Setup Methods\n\n#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)\n\nWe provide setup scripts to help you configure these variables interactively.\n\n**macOS / Linux:**\nRun the shell script located in the plugin configuration folder:\n\n```bash\n./plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/commands/config/init_mcp_cred.sh\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Manual Configuration\n\n1. Open your Claude Code settings file. On macOS/Linux, this is usually `~/.claude/settings.json`.\n2. Add or update the `env` object with your credentials:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"CONVERSATION_PROJECT_ID\": \"your-project-id\",\n    \"CONVERSATION_KEY_ID\": \"your-key-id\",\n    \"CONVERSATION_KEY_SECRET\": \"your-key-secret\",\n    \"CONVERSATION_REGION\": \"your-app-region (e.g., us, eu, br)\",\n    \"CONVERSATION_APP_ID\": \"your-app-id\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Restart Claude Code** for the changes to take effect.\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed and configured, you can use natural language or specific slash commands to interact with the API.\n\n### Common Commands\n\n- **Setup Help**:\n\n  ```\n  /sinch-claude-plugin:sinch-help\n  ```\n\n- **Send a Message**:\n\n  ```\n  /sinch-claude-plugin:api:messages:send --to=+15551234567 --message=\"Hello from Claude!\"\n  ```\n\n- **List Webhooks**:\n\n  ```\n  /sinch-claude-plugin:api:webhooks:list\n  ```\n\n- **List Active Senders**:\n  ```\n  /sinch-claude-plugin:api:senders:list\n  ```\n\n### Architecture\n\nThis plugin leverages the [Sinch MCP Server](https://github.com/sinch/sinch-mcp-server) to communicate with the Sinch Conversation API. It defines a set of tools and prompts that Claude Code uses to perform actions on your behalf.\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are natural-language workflows that guide Claude through common tasks.\n\n- Skills live under [plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/).\n- Skills are also published as a standalone artifact in this repository's Releases.\n\nAvailable skills:\n\n- [Send Message](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/send-message/SKILL.md)\n- [Channel Info](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/channel-info/SKILL.md)\n- [List Messages](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/list-messages/SKILL.md)\n- [Manage Contact](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/manage-contact/SKILL.md)\n- [Manage Webhook](plugins/sinch-claude-plugin/skills/manage-webhook/SKILL.md)\n\n## Gemini CLI\n\nA Gemini CLI extension that integrates the Sinch Conversation API, allowing you to send SMS messages, manage webhooks, and interact with your Sinch configuration directly from Gemini CLI.\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Install from GitHub\n\n```bash\ngemini extensions install https://github.com/sinch/sinch-plugins\n```\n\n#### Install from Local Path\n\n```bash\ncd sinch-plugins/plugins/sinch-gemini-extension\ngemini extensions install .\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nDuring installation, Gemini CLI will automatically prompt you for your Sinch credentials:\n\n- **CONVERSATION_PROJECT_ID**: Your Sinch project ID (required)\n- **CONVERSATION_KEY_ID**: Your API key ID (required)\n- **CONVERSATION_KEY_SECRET**: Your API key secret (required, stored securely)\n- **CONVERSATION_REGION**: Your region (us, eu, or br) (required)\n- **CONVERSATION_APP_ID**: Your Sinch Conversation API App ID (required)\n\n### Verify Installation\n\n```bash\n# List installed extensions\ngemini extensions list\n\n# View extension settings\ngemini extensions settings list sinch\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, restart Gemini CLI and use the available commands:\n\n```bash\n# Start Gemini CLI\ngemini\n\n# Send a message\n/sinch:api:messages:send --to=+14155551234 --message=\"Hello from Sinch\"\n\n# List webhooks\n/sinch:api:webhooks:list\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n- `/sinch:api:messages:send` - Send SMS messages\n- `/sinch:api:webhooks:list` - List webhooks\n- `/sinch:api:webhooks:create` - Create webhook\n- `/sinch:api:webhooks:update` - Update webhook\n- `/sinch:api:webhooks:delete` - Delete webhook\n- `/sinch:api:webhooks:triggers` - List available triggers\n- `/sinch:api:senders:list` - List active senders\n\n### Managing Settings\n\n```bash\n# View extension settings\ngemini extensions settings list sinch\n\n# Update a setting\ngemini extensions settings set sinch \"Key Secret\"\n```\n\n### Extension Management\n\n```bash\n# Update extension\ngemini extensions update sinch\n\n# Disable extension\ngemini extensions disable sinch\n\n# Enable extension\ngemini extensions enable sinch\n\n# Uninstall extension\ngemini extensions uninstall sinch\n```\n\nFor detailed documentation, see [plugins/sinch-gemini-extension/.gemini-extension/README.md](plugins/sinch-gemini-extension/.gemini-extension/README.md).\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n\nCopyright Sinch AB, https://sinch.com\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nDeveloper Documentation: [https://developers.sinch.com/docs/conversation/](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/conversation/)\n\n---\n\n## Feedback, Issues and Support\n\nWe love hearing feedback, and we are here to help if you run into any issues.\n\n- For any Sinch Conversation API related issues, or support you require, head over to the [Sinch Help Centre](https://sinch.com/help-center/)\n\nWe will continue to enhance this product with new features in future.\n\nFrom all of us at Sinch, happy coding!\n"
