Turns out Claude Desktop’s plugin system auto-prefixes skill\nnames with the plugin name, so having both a slash command AND a skill with overlapping names was\ncausing conflicts. The skill was being called three different ways at once. Fixed it by removing the\nslash command entirely and renaming the skill directory to match the expected registration name. Also\nhad to chase down a bunch of related issues - duplicate namespace prefixes, incorrect script paths\nafter the directory rename, and the version footer not updating properly. Got it all working and\nreleased version 1.1.8 (https://github.com/dreamiurg/shipmate/releases/tag/v1.1.8)\n\n- **Wrote blog post about Shipmate development** - Documented the journey of building the Shipmate\nend-of-day summary skill, from initial idea through the naming issues I ran into today. Focused on\nthe process and what I learned about Claude Desktop’s plugin system - how it handles skill\nregistration, the auto-prefixing behavior, and why slash commands can collide with skill names. Also\nadded a style guide to my blog that emphasizes intellectual honesty and process-focused narrative,\ninspired by writing principles of the blog authors I follow.\n\n- **Housekeeping** - Set up pre-commit hooks for several repos (gitleaks for secrets, markdownlint for\ndocumentation quality, conventional commits for PR titles), added CI workflow to Shipmate with\nbadges for build status and latest release, configured branch protection, updated documentation to\nreference the main branch instead of master, and cleaned up some stale tool version files.\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe shipmate:eod skill follows a multi-phase workflow to generate conversational end-of-day summaries:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    Start([User asks Claude for<br/>end-of-day summary]) --> Detect[Phase 1: GitHub Detection<br/>Scan for GitHub organizations<br/>and personal account]\n\n    Detect --> Scope{Multiple GitHub<br/>identities found?}\n    Scope -->|Yes| AskScope[Ask user which scope:<br/>Personal, Org, or All]\n    Scope -->|No| ExtractGH\n    AskScope --> ExtractGH\n\n    ExtractGH[Phase 2: GitHub Extraction<br/>github-analyzer-agent Haiku]\n    ExtractClaude[Phase 3: Claude Session Extraction<br/>claude-analyzer-agent Haiku]\n\n    ExtractGH --> ParallelGH[Run parallel GitHub CLI queries<br/>for last 24 hours]\n    ExtractClaude --> SearchSessions[Search ~/.claude/ directory<br/>for session history]\n\n    ParallelGH --> Commits[Commits<br/>gh search commits]\n    ParallelGH --> Issues[Issues<br/>gh search issues]\n    ParallelGH --> PRs[Pull Requests<br/>gh search prs]\n\n    Commits --> Correlate\n    Issues --> Correlate\n    PRs --> Correlate\n    SearchSessions --> Correlate\n\n    Correlate[Phase 4: Correlation<br/>Match sessions to GitHub activity<br/>by time proximity + project path]\n\n    Correlate --> Enrich[Enrich GitHub activities with<br/>related session context]\n\n    Enrich --> Analyze[Phase 5: Theme Analysis<br/>Identify topics and patterns<br/>from enriched activity data]\n\n    Analyze --> Select[Phase 6: Topic Selection<br/>Ask user to pick 2-4 main<br/>accomplishments]\n\n    Select --> Summarize[Phase 7: Summary Generation<br/>summarizer-agent Sonnet<br/>Weave in session insights]\n\n    Summarize --> Integrate{Integrations<br/>enabled?}\n\n    Integrate -->|Notion| Notion[Post to Notion<br/>Daily Log page]\n    Integrate -->|None| Display\n    Notion --> Display\n\n    Display[Phase 8: Display Summary<br/>Show formatted output to user]\n\n    Display --> End([User receives conversational<br/>daily update])\n\n    style Start fill:#e1f5ff\n    style End fill:#e1f5ff\n    style ExtractGH fill:#fff4e1\n    style ExtractClaude fill:#fff4e1\n    style ParallelGH fill:#fff4e1\n    style SearchSessions fill:#fff4e1\n    style Commits fill:#f0f0f0\n    style Issues fill:#f0f0f0\n    style PRs fill:#f0f0f0\n    style Correlate fill:#ffe8e8\n    style Summarize fill:#e8f5e9\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Two-Tier Agent Architecture**: Fast Haiku agents for data extraction, powerful Sonnet agent for narrative synthesis\n- **Parallel Extraction**: GitHub CLI queries run simultaneously; Claude sessions extracted independently\n- **Smart Correlation**: Matches Claude Code sessions to GitHub activities by time proximity (±2 hours) and project path\n- **Session Insights**: Reveals depth of work behind commits (duration, message count, file edits, bash commands)\n- **User Control**: You select which topics become main accomplishments vs housekeeping\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with available data if sources fail; handles missing Claude session directory\n- **Multi-Integration Support**: Post summaries to Notion, with Slack and other integrations planned\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) installed\n- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) version 2.23.0 or higher\n- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`)\n\n### Install Plugin\n\nThis repo contains both marketplace and plugin. To add it to Claude Code, run:\n\n```bash\n% claude\n> /plugin marketplace add dreamiurg/shipmate\n  ⎿  Successfully added marketplace: shipmate-marketplace\n\n> /plugin install shipmate@shipmate-marketplace\n  ⎿  ✓ Installed shipmate. Restart Claude Code to load new plugins.\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nIn any Claude Code session:\n\n```bash\n\"What skills are available?\"\n```\n\nYou should see `shipmate:eod` listed.\n\n## Usage\n\nAsk Claude to generate your end-of-day summary:\n\n```text\n\"Generate my end-of-day summary\"\n```\n\nOr directly invoke the skill using the Skill tool:\n\n```text\nUse the shipmate:eod skill\n```\n\nThe skill will:\n\n1. Ask which GitHub scope to include (personal, org, or all)\n2. Extract your activity from the last 24 hours\n3. Identify themes and topics from your work\n4. Ask you to select 2-4 main accomplishments\n5. Generate a conversational summary\n6. Optionally post to Notion (if configured)\n\n## Features\n\n- **Smart activity extraction** - Pulls commits, issues, and PRs from the last 24 hours\n- **Claude Code Session Integration** - Reveals depth of work behind commits by correlating with Claude Code session history\n- **Conversational summaries** - Turns raw GitHub data into readable updates\n- **Multi-organization support** - Track activity across personal and org accounts\n- **Topic selection** - You pick what to highlight vs what's housekeeping\n- **Pluggable integrations** - Post to Notion, Slack (coming soon), or save locally\n\n## Configuration\n\nShipmate can be configured via `shipmate.yaml` in either:\n\n- `~/.claude/shipmate.yaml` (global config)\n- `<project>/.claude/shipmate.yaml` (project-specific, overrides global)\n\nSee [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for all options.\n\n### Example Configuration\n\n```yaml\n# Set default GitHub scope\ngithub_scope: \"all\"  # or \"personal\" or \"my-org-name\"\n\n# Claude Code Session Integration\nclaude_sessions:\n  enabled: true                    # Enable Claude Code session integration\n  time_window_hours: 24            # How far back to look for sessions\n  correlation_window_hours: 2      # Time proximity for matching sessions to commits\n  min_duration_minutes: 2          # Ignore sessions shorter than this\n\n# Enable integrations\nintegrations:\n  notion:\n    enabled: true\n    daily_log_url: \"https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/Daily-Log-abc123\"\n```\n\nSee [Claude Sessions Documentation](docs/CLAUDE_SESSIONS.md) for details.\n\n## Integrations\n\n### Notion\n\nPost your daily summary to a Notion Daily Log page. See [integrations/notion/README.md](integrations/notion/README.md) for setup instructions.\n\n## Example Output\n\n```markdown\n# Daily Update - November 4, 2025\n\n**What I accomplished today:**\n\n- **Investigated AWS infrastructure** - Dug through the AWS account to see what we're working with. Found the IAM setup, about 3.37 GB of data sitting in S3 buckets, VPC config, and figured out who has admin access. Got it all documented for when we migrate to a new AWS Organization (https://github.com/example-org/docs/blob/main/infrastructure/aws.md)\n\n- **Investigated deployment process** - Figured out how we actually ship code. Frontend is manual deploys through Vercel CLI, backend auto-deploys from GitHub via Railway. Takes 2-5 minutes. (https://github.com/example-org/docs/blob/main/infrastructure/deployment-process.md)\n\n- **Housekeeping** - Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent secrets from leaking, added markdown linting, created issue templates\n```\n\n## Customization\n\n### Change Summary Format\n\nEdit `agents/summarizer-agent.md` to customize:\n\n- Tone and style\n- Output structure\n- What details to include/exclude\n\n### Change Data Sources\n\nEdit `agents/github-analyzer-agent.md` to:\n\n- Add more GitHub queries\n- Include different time ranges\n- Filter by labels or other criteria\n\n### Add New Integrations\n\n1. Create `integrations/<name>/README.md` with setup instructions\n2. Add integration config to `config.example.yaml`\n3. Update `skills/shipmate:end-of-day-summary/SKILL.md` Step 8 to handle the new integration\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local development setup, testing, and contribution guidelines.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details\n"
