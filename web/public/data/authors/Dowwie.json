Agents perform translation and execution.\n\n---\n\n## Pipeline\n\nTasker enforces a three-stage pipeline: **specify → plan → execute**.\n\n### Specify\nHuman intent is exhaustively clarified.  \nEdge cases, state transitions, and invariants are made explicit before any implementation begins.\n\n### Plan\nThe specification is decomposed into isolated, context-bounded tasks with explicit inputs, outputs, and dependencies.\n\n### Execute\nAgents implement tasks against the plan and verify results against the spec.\n\nBy the time code is written:\n- Behavior is defined\n- Edge cases are resolved\n- Logic is verified\n\nImplementation becomes translation, not discovery.\n\n---\n\n## A Compiler for Specifications\n\nTasker acts as a compiler for requirements.\n\nLike a borrow checker, it enforces semantic safety:\n- Agents cannot implement behavior that was not declared\n- Architectural changes require explicit, recorded decisions\n- Undeclared state transitions and logic drift fail early\n\nEvery artifact is traceable back to a specific requirement.\n\n\n\n## Graceful Interrupt Workflow\n\nOften, you want to pause Tasker development and resume later, and you can gracefully do so:\n- to stop (from any terminal): ```tasker stop```\n- to resume: ```tasker resume```\n\nThen run any tasker command again in Claude Code to pick up from where you left off.\n\n\n*Prerequisite: tasker must be in PATH (installed via install.sh to ~/.local/bin/tasker)*\n\n\n\n"
