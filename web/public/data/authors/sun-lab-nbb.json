The CLI abstracts the project's environment manipulation and facilitates mundane development tasks, such as\nlinting, typing, and documenting the source code API. This library also serves as a\n[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin marketplace, distributing a set of agentic skills\nthat enforce Sun Lab development conventions across all downstream projects.\n\n___\n\n## Features\n\n- Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n- Optimized for runtime speed by using mamba and uv for all environment management tasks.\n- Compliments the extensive suite of tox environments and tasks used by all Sun lab projects to streamline development.\n- Exports agentic skills for Claude Code that enforce coding style, documentation, and project structure conventions.\n- Apache 2.0 License.\n\n___\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Claude Code Skills](#claude-code-skills)\n- [API Documentation](#api-documentation)\n- [Developers](#developers)\n- [Versioning](#versioning)\n- [Authors](#authors)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)\n\n___\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). This library expects that a miniforge3 distribution is\n  used to install and export the [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) environment manager to the host-system's\n  PATH variable.\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). This library uses uv as the main package management engine and expects that uv is\n  available from the system's base Python environment.\n\nFor users, all other library dependencies are installed automatically by all supported installation methods.\nFor developers, see the [Developers](#developers) section for information on installing additional development\ndependencies.\n\n___\n\n## Installation\n\n### Source\n\n***Note,*** installation from source is ***highly discouraged*** for anyone who is not an active project developer.\nIf possible, use the pip installation method described below.\n\n1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as\n   [git clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n2. `cd` into the root directory of the project.\n3. Run `pip install .` to install the project and its dependencies.\n\n### pip\n\nUse the following command to install the library and all of its dependencies via\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n\n```\npip install ataraxis-automation\n```\n\n___\n\n## Usage\n***Note,*** the library expects the managed project to use a specific configuration and file structure. If any CLI\ncommand terminates with an error, the terminal output describes whether the error is due to an invalid project\nconfiguration or file structure.\n\n### Automation Command-Line Interface\nAll library functions designed to be called by end-users are exposed through the 'automation-cli' Command Line\nInterface (CLI). This CLI is automatically exposed by installing the library into a Python environment.\n\n#### Automation-CLI\nAll functions supplied by the library are accessible by calling `automation-cli` from a Python environment where\nthe library is installed. For example:\n- Use `automation-cli --help` to verify that the CLI is available and to see the list of supported commands.\n- Use `automation-cli COMMAND-NAME --help` to display additional information about a specific command. For example:\n  `automation-cli import-environment --help`.\n\n#### Tox Integration\nThis library is intended to be used via [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/user_guide.html) tasks (environments). To use\nany of the exposed CLI's commands as part of a tox environment, add it to the 'commands' section of the tox.ini:\n```\n[testenv:create]\ndeps =\n    ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ncommands =\n    automation-cli create-environment --environment-name axa_dev --python-version 3.14\n```\n\nSee the [tox.ini file](tox.ini) configuration file for the most up-to-date project development automation\nsuite used in the Sun lab. For the most up-to-date C-extension project automation suite, see the tox.ini file of the\n[ataraxis-time](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-time) library.\n\n#### Additional Command Arguments\n***Note,*** many sub-commands of the CLI have additional flags and arguments that can be used to further customize\ntheir runtime. Consult the [API documentation](#api-documentation) for the list of additional runtime flags for all\nsupported CLI commands.\n\n### Supported Checkout Tox Tasks\nThis library is tightly linked to the environments defined in the [tox.ini file](tox.ini) configuration file.\n\n***Warning!*** Commands listed in this section may and frequently are modified based on the specific needs of each\nSun lab project. This section is ***not*** a replacement for studying the tox.ini file for each Sun lab project.\n\nMost commands in this section are designed to be executed together as part of the `tox` CLI command. These commands\nare referred to as 'checkout' tasks and must run successfully for any pull request candidate before it is merged into\nthe main branch of each Sun lab project.\n\n#### Lint\nShell command: `tox -e lint`\n\nUses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to statically analyze and,\nwhere possible, fix code formatting, typing, and problematic use patterns. As part of its runtime, this task uses\nautomation-cli to remove existing stub (.pyi) files from the source directories, as they sometimes interfere with\ntype-checking.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:lint]\ndescription =\n    Runs static code formatting, style, and typing checkers. Follows the configuration defined in the pyproject.toml\n    file.\ndependency_groups = dev\nbasepython = py312\ncommands =\n    automation-cli purge-stubs\n    ruff format\n    ruff check --fix ./src\n    mypy ./src\n```\n\n#### Stubs\nShell command: `tox -e stubs`\n\nUses [stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html) to generate stub (.pyi) files and distributes them\nvia automation-cli to the appropriate levels of the project's source code hierarchy. As part of this process,\nautomation-cli also ensures that there is a 'py.typed' marker file in the highest library directory. This is required\nfor type-checkers like mypy to recognize the library as 'typed' and process it during type-checking tasks.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:stubs]\ndescription = Generates the py.typed marker and the .pyi stub files using the project's wheel distribution.\ndepends = lint\ndependency_groups = dev\ncommands =\n    automation-cli process-typed-markers\n    stubgen -o stubs --include-private -p ataraxis_automation -v\n    automation-cli process-stubs\n    ruff format\n    ruff check --select I --fix ./src\n```\n\n#### Test\nShell command: `tox -e pyXXX-test`\n\nThis task is executed for all python versions supported by each project. For example, ataraxis-automation supports\nversions 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. Therefore, it has `tox -e py312-test`, `tox -e py313-test`, and\n`tox -e py314-test` as valid 'test' tasks. These tasks build the project in an isolated environment and\nrun the project's unit and integration tests to verify that the project works as expected for each supported python\nversion.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:{py312, py313, py314}-test]\npackage = wheel\ndescription =\n    Runs unit and integration tests for each of the python versions listed in the task name and aggregates test coverage\n    data. Uses 'loadgroup' balancing and all logical cores to optimize task runtime speed.\ndependency_groups = dev\nsetenv = COVERAGE_FILE = reports{/}.coverage.{envname}\ncommands =\n    pytest --import-mode=append --cov=ataraxis_automation --cov-config=pyproject.toml --cov-report=xml \\\n    --junitxml=reports/pytest.xml.{envname} -n logical --dist loadgroup\n```\n\n#### Coverage\nShell command: `tox -e coverage`\n\nThis task is used in conjunction with the 'test' task. It aggregates code coverage data for different python versions\nand compiles it into an HTML report accessible by opening PROJECT_ROOT/reports/coverage_html/index.html in a browser.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:coverage]\nskip_install = true\ndescription =\n    Combines test-coverage data from multiple test runs (for different python versions) into a single html file. The\n    file can be viewed by loading the 'reports/coverage_html/index.html'.\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\nsetenv = COVERAGE_FILE = reports/.coverage\ndepends = {py312, py313, py314}-test\ncommands =\n    junitparser merge --glob reports/pytest.xml.* reports/pytest.xml\n    coverage combine --keep\n    coverage xml\n    coverage html\n```\n\n#### Docs\nShell command: `tox -e docs`\n\nUses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to automatically parse docstrings from source code and build the\nAPI documentation for the project. This task relies on the configuration files stored inside the\nPROJECT_ROOT/docs/source directory to define the generated documentation format. Built documentation can be viewed by\nopening PROJECT_ROOT/docs/build/html/index.html in a browser.\n\nExample tox.ini section for a pure-python project:\n```\ndescription =\n    Builds the API documentation from source code docstrings using Sphinx. The result can be viewed by loading\n    'docs/build/html/index.html'.\ndepends = uninstall\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ncommands =\n    sphinx-build -b html -d docs/build/doctrees docs/source docs/build/html -j auto -v\n```\n\n***Note,*** C-extension projects use a slightly modified version of this task that uses\n[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to parse doxygen-styled docstrings used in the C-code and\n[breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert doxygen-generated XML files for C-code into a\nSphinx-compatible format. This allows C-extension projects to include both Python and C/C++ API documentation in the\nsame .html file. To support this behavior, the tox.ini file must include an additional command: `doxygen Doxyfile`.\n\nExample tox.ini section for a C-extension project:\n```\ndescription =\n    Builds the API documentation from source code docstrings using Sphinx. The result can be viewed by loading\n    'docs/build/html/index.html'.\ndepends = uninstall\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ncommands =\n    doxygen Doxyfile\n    sphinx-build -b html -d docs/build/doctrees docs/source docs/build/html -j auto -v\n```\n\n#### Build\nShell command: `tox -e build`\n\nThis task builds a source-code distribution (sdist) and a binary distribution (wheel) for the project. These\ndistributions can then be uploaded to GitHub or PyPI or shared with the intended audience through any other means.\nPure-python projects use [hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) and [build](https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/) to\ngenerate one source-code and one binary distribution. C-extension projects use\n[cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/) to compile the C-code for all supported platforms and\narchitectures, building many binary distribution files alongside source-code distribution generated via build.\n\nExample tox.ini section for a pure-python project:\n```\n[testenv:build]\nskip_install = true\ndescription = Builds the project's source code distribution (sdist) and binary distribution (wheel).\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\nallowlist_externals = docker\ncommands =\n    python -m build . --sdist\n    python -m build . --wheel\n```\n\nExample tox.ini section for a C-extension project:\n```\n[testenv:build]\nskip-install = true\ndescription =\n    Builds the project's source code distribution (sdist) and compiles and assembles binary wheels for all\n    supported platform architectures.\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\nallowlist_externals = docker\ncommands =\n    python -m build . --sdist\n    cibuildwheel --output-dir dist --platform auto\n```\n\n#### Upload\nShell command: `tox -e upload`\n\nUploads the sdist and wheel files created by the 'build' task to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). When this task runs for the\nfirst time, it uses automation-cli to generate a .pypirc file and store the user-provided PyPI API token in that file.\nThis allows reusing the token for later uploads, streamlining the process. Once uploaded, the project (library) becomes\na valid target for `pip install LIBRARYNAME` commands.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:upload]\nskip_install = true\ndescription = Uses twine to upload all files inside the project's 'dist' directory to PyPI.\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\nallowlist_externals = distutils\ncommands =\n    automation-cli acquire-pypi-token {posargs:}\n    twine upload dist/* --skip-existing --config-file .pypirc\n```\n\n### Supported Mamba Environment Manipulation Tox Tasks\nThese tasks were added to automate repetitive tasks associated with managing project mamba environments during\ndevelopment. They assume that there is a validly configured mamba distribution installed and accessible from the\nshell of the machine that calls these commands.\n\n\n#### Install\nShell command: `tox -e install`\n\nInstalls the project into its development mamba environment. To allow installing prerelease packages, use\n`tox -e install -- --prerelease`.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:install]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndepends =\n    lint\n    stubs\n    {py312, py313, py314}-test\n    coverage\n    docs\n    export\ndescription = Builds and installs the project into its development mamba environment.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli install-project --environment-name axa_dev\n```\n\n#### Uninstall\nShell command: `tox -e uninstall`\n\nRemoves the project from its development mamba environment.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:uninstall]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription = Uninstalls the project from its development mamba environment.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli uninstall-project --environment-name axa_dev\n```\n\n#### Create\nShell command: `tox -e create`\n\nCreates the project's development mamba environment and installs project dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file\ninto the environment. This task is intended to be used when setting up project development environments for new\nplatforms and architectures. The task assumes that all dependencies are stored using the Sun Lab format: inside the\ngeneral 'dependencies' section and the optional 'dev' dependency section. To allow installing prerelease packages, use\n`tox -e create -- --prerelease`.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:create]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription =\n    Creates the project's development mamba environment using the requested python version and installs runtime and\n    development project dependencies extracted from the pyproject.toml file.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli create-environment --environment-name axa_dev --python-version 3.14\n```\n\n#### Remove\nShell command: `tox -e remove`\n\nRemoves the project's development mamba environment. Primarily, this task is intended to be used to clean the local\nsystem after project development is finished. Note; to reset the environment, it is advised to use the 'provision' task\ninstead (see below).\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:remove]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription = Removes the project's development mamba environment.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli remove-environment --environment-name axa_dev\n```\n\n#### Provision\nShell command: `tox -e provision`\n\nThis task is a combination of the 'remove' and 'create' tasks. It is designed to reset the project's development\nenvironment by recreating it from scratch. This is used to both reset and actualize project development environments\nto match the latest version of the pyproject.toml file dependency specification. To allow installing prerelease\npackages, use `tox -e provision -- --prerelease`.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:provision]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription = Provisions the project's development mamba environment by removing and (re)creating the environment.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli provision-environment --environment-name axa_dev --python-version 3.14\n```\n\n#### Export\nShell command: `tox -e export`\n\nExports the project's development environment as a .yml and spec.txt file. This task is used before distributing new\nversions of the project to allow the target audience to generate an identical copy of the development environment using\nthe generated .yml and spec.txt files. While 'create' and 'provision' tasks make this largely obsolete, this\nfunctionality is maintained for all Sun lab projects.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:export]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription =\n    Exports the project's development mamba environment to the 'envs' project directory as a .yml file and as a\n    spec.txt with revision history.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli export-environment --environment-name axa_dev\n```\n\n#### Import\nShell command: `tox -e import`\n\nImports the project's development environment from its .yml file. If the environment does not exist, this\ncreates an identical copy of the environment stored in the .yml file. If the environment already exists, it is updated\nusing the .yml file. The update process is configured to prune any unused packages not found inside the .yml file.\n\nExample tox.ini section:\n```\n[testenv:import]\nskip_install = true\ndeps = ataraxis-automation==8.0.0\ndescription =\n    Creates or updates the project's development mamba environment using the .yml file stored in the 'envs' project\n    directory.\ncommands =\n    automation-cli import-environment --environment-name axa_dev\n```\n\n___\n\n## Claude Code Skills\n\nThis library serves as a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin marketplace, distributing\na set of agentic skills that enforce Sun Lab development conventions across all downstream projects. These skills\nprovide Claude Code with project-specific knowledge about coding style, documentation format, commit messages, project\nstructure, and more.\n\n### Available Skills\n\n| Skill               | Description                                                      |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `/explore-codebase` | Performs in-depth codebase exploration at the start of a session |\n| `/python-style`     | Applies Sun Lab Python coding conventions                        |\n| `/cpp-style`        | Applies Sun Lab C++ coding conventions                           |\n| `/csharp-style`     | Applies Sun Lab C# coding conventions                            |\n| `/readme-style`     | Applies Sun Lab README conventions                               |\n| `/pyproject-style`  | Applies Sun Lab pyproject.toml conventions                       |\n| `/api-docs`         | Applies Sun Lab API documentation conventions                    |\n| `/project-layout`   | Applies Sun Lab project directory structure conventions          |\n| `/tox-config`       | Applies Sun Lab tox.ini conventions                              |\n| `/commit`           | Drafts style-compliant git commit messages                       |\n| `/skill-design`     | Generates, updates, and verifies skill files and CLAUDE.md       |\n\n### Installing for Claude Code\n\nClaude Code supports plugin installation through its built-in marketplace system. To install the skills provided by\nthis library:\n\n1. Open Claude Code and add the ataraxis marketplace by running: \n`/plugin marketplace add Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-automation`\n2. Install the automation plugin from the marketplace:\n`/plugin install automation@ataraxis`\n\nAlternatively, use the interactive plugin manager by running `/plugin`, navigating to the **Discover** tab, and\nselecting the `automation` plugin.\n\n***Note,*** the plugin can be installed at different scopes depending on the intended use:\n- **user** (default): Available across all projects for the current user.\n- **project**: Shared with all developers via version control (stored in `.claude/settings.json`).\n- **local**: Project-specific and gitignored (stored in `.claude/settings.local.json`).\n\nTo specify a scope during installation, use the CLI form: `claude plugin install automation@ataraxis --scope project`\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThese skills are designed for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), the official CLI tool from\nAnthropic. The plugin marketplace system is a Claude Code feature and is not currently available in other Claude\ndistributions such as Claude Desktop or the Claude web interface. However, the skill files themselves are plain Markdown\nand can be referenced manually in any context that supports custom instructions or system prompts.\n\n___\n\n## API Documentation\n\nSee the [API documentation](https://ataraxis-automation-api-docs.netlify.app/) for the\ndetailed description of the methods and classes exposed by components of this library. ***Note,*** the documentation\nalso includes a list of all command-line interface functions and their arguments.\n\n___\n\n## Developers\n\nThis section provides installation, dependency, and build-system instructions for the developers that want to modify\nthe source code of this library.\n\n### Installing the Project\n\n***Note,*** this installation method requires **mamba version 2.3.2 or above**. Currently, all Sun lab automation\npipelines require that mamba is installed through the [miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) installer.\n\n1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as git-cloning.\n2. If the downloaded distribution is stored as a compressed archive, unpack it using the appropriate decompression tool.\n3. `cd` to the root directory of the prepared project distribution.\n4. Install the core Sun lab development dependencies into the ***base*** mamba environment via the\n   `mamba install tox uv tox-uv` command.\n5. Use the `tox -e create` command to create the project-specific development environment followed by\n   `tox -e install` command to install the project into that environment as a library.\n\n### Additional Dependencies\n\nIn addition to installing the project and all user dependencies, install the following dependencies:\n\n1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) distributions, one for each version supported by the developed project.\n   Currently, this library supports the three latest stable versions. It is recommended to use a tool like\n   [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage the required versions.\n2. [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/), if the project uses C-extensions. This is necessary to build the API documentation\n   for the C-code portion of the project.\n\n### Development Automation\n\nThis project uses `tox` for development automation. The following tox environments are available:\n\n| Environment          | Description                                                  |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `lint`               | Runs ruff formatting, ruff linting, and mypy type checking   |\n| `stubs`              | Generates py.typed marker and .pyi stub files                |\n| `{py312,...}-test`   | Runs the test suite via pytest for each supported Python     |\n| `coverage`           | Aggregates test coverage into an HTML report                 |\n| `docs`               | Builds the API documentation via Sphinx                      |\n| `build`              | Builds sdist and wheel distributions                         |\n| `upload`             | Uploads distributions to PyPI via twine                      |\n| `install`            | Builds and installs the project into its mamba environment   |\n| `uninstall`          | Uninstalls the project from its mamba environment            |\n| `create`             | Creates the project's mamba development environment          |\n| `remove`             | Removes the project's mamba development environment          |\n| `provision`          | Recreates the mamba environment from scratch                 |\n| `export`             | Exports the mamba environment as .yml and spec.txt files     |\n| `import`             | Creates or updates the mamba environment from a .yml file    |\n\nRun any environment using `tox -e ENVIRONMENT`. For example, `tox -e lint`.\n\n***Note,*** automation pipelines for this library have been modified from the implementation used in all other\nprojects, as they require this library to support their runtime. To avoid circular dependencies, the pipelines for\nthis library always compile and install the library from source code before running each automation task.\n\n***Note,*** all pull requests for this project have to successfully complete the `tox` task before being merged.\nTo expedite the task's runtime, use the `tox --parallel` command to run some tasks in parallel.\n\n### Automation Troubleshooting\n\nMany packages used in 'tox' automation pipelines (uv, mypy, ruff) and 'tox' itself may experience runtime failures. In\nmost cases, this is related to their caching behavior. If an unintelligible error is encountered with\nany of the automation components, deleting the corresponding .cache (.tox, .ruff_cache, .mypy_cache, etc.) manually\nor via a CLI command typically solves the issue.\n\n___\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
