Literary prose, iterative review, and craft-aware feedback.\n\n## What This Is\n\nA complete fiction writing system—from initial concept through final draft. Specialized agents handle different aspects of the craft: architecture, characters, prose, review, editing, continuity, and publishing prep.\n\nThis isn't a chatbot that writes generic content. It's a writing partner that understands story structure, character arcs, scene economy, and the difference between good prose and great prose.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugins:add howells/fiction\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### New Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:plan        # Design your story's architecture\n/fiction:character   # Develop your protagonist\n/fiction:outline     # Break into chapters\n\"Write chapter 1\"    # Start writing\n```\n\n### Existing Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:go          # Load project and see what to work on next\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/fiction:go` | Resume a project (load context + suggest what to do next) |\n| `/fiction:new` | Start a new fiction project from scratch |\n| `/fiction:plan` | Design story architecture (premise, theme, ending) |\n| `/fiction:outline` | Create chapter and scene breakdown |\n| `/fiction:character` | Develop a character document |\n| `/fiction:review` | Review current chapter |\n| `/fiction:critique` | Full manuscript review (NYT/New Yorker style) |\n| `/fiction:synopsis` | Generate synopsis (short/medium/long) |\n| `/fiction:edit` | Line-level editing (spelling, grammar, word echoes) |\n| `/fiction:naming` | Generate and validate book title options |\n| `/fiction:cover` | Generate cover art prompts for image generation |\n| `/fiction:build` | Build EPUB from your manuscript |\n| `/fiction:reconcile` | Update project to current plugin conventions |\n| `/fiction:next` | Get suggestion for what to work on next |\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n/my-novel\n├── README.md           # Overview, status, key decisions\n├── progress.md         # Session tracking, continuity state\n├── themes.md           # Central question, thematic content\n├── characters/         # Character documents\n├── world/              # Setting documents\n├── craft/              # Tone guide\n├── chapters/           # Chapter files\n├── critiques/          # Saved critiques\n├── synopses/           # Saved synopses\n├── builds/             # EPUB builds\n└── covers/             # Cover art iterations\n```\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\nFiction writing isn't linear—it's iterative. Here's how to use the plugin effectively:\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n\nStart with `/fiction:new` for a guided project setup, or build manually:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:plan          # Define premise, theme, ending, tone\n/fiction:character     # Develop protagonist and key characters\n/fiction:outline       # Break into chapters with scene beats\n```\n\n**Don't skip this.** A weak foundation creates problems that compound with every chapter. Know your ending before you start writing.\n\n### Phase 2: First Draft\n\nWrite chapters one at a time. After each chapter:\n\n```bash\n\"Write chapter 3\"      # Write the chapter\n/fiction:review        # Get craft-focused feedback\n# Revise based on feedback\n/fiction:review        # Review again if needed\n```\n\nThe review → revise → review loop is where the real work happens. Don't move on until a chapter is solid.\n\n### Phase 3: Polish\n\nOnce all chapters are drafted:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:edit          # Line-level editing (all chapters)\n/fiction:review        # Re-review after edits\n```\n\nThe editor catches spelling, grammar, word echoes, and awkward phrasing. Review again afterward—editing can introduce new issues.\n\n### Phase 4: Manuscript Review\n\nWhen the full draft is complete:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:critique      # Full manuscript critique (NYT/New Yorker style)\n```\n\nThis is a comprehensive review of the entire work: structure, character arcs, themes, pacing, prose quality. Use it to identify what needs revision before calling the manuscript done.\n\n### Phase 5: Publishing Prep\n\nWhen the manuscript is final:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:synopsis      # Generate query letter synopses\n/fiction:naming        # Find the right title\n/fiction:cover         # Generate cover art prompts\n/fiction:build         # Export to EPUB\n```\n\n### The Short Version\n\n```\n/fiction:new or /fiction:plan\n         ↓\n    Foundation work (characters, outline)\n         ↓\n┌──→ Write chapter\n│        ↓\n│    /fiction:review\n│        ↓\n└─── Revise (loop until solid)\n         ↓\n    /fiction:edit (all chapters)\n         ↓\n    /fiction:critique (full manuscript)\n         ↓\n    Publishing prep (synopsis, naming, cover, build)\n```\n\n### Returning to a Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:go            # Load project and get recommendation for what to do next\n```\n\n## Core Principles\n\nThe plugin enforces these craft principles:\n\n1. **Story = Character + Change** — Plot is what happens; story is what it means\n2. **Scene Economy** — Every scene must do at least two things\n3. **Specificity Creates Universality** — Concrete details create resonance\n4. **Earned Moments** — Plant before harvest\n5. **Trust the Reader** — Show, don't tell. Imply, don't explain\n6. **Write for the Ear** — Modern books become audiobooks\n\n## Anchored Constraints\n\nMark immutable decisions with `## ⚓ Anchored` in any document. Review agents treat these as non-negotiable.\n\n```markdown\n## ⚓ Anchored\n\n- The protagonist never learns the truth about her father\n- The ending is ambiguous\n- No magic system explanations; it stays mysterious\n```\n\n## Craft References\n\n14 reference documents guide the writing and review process:\n\n| Problem | Reference |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Story feels aimless | `story-structure.md` |\n| Scene drags | `scene-structure.md` |\n| Flat characters | `character.md` |\n| Stilted dialogue | `dialogue.md` |\n| Prose lacks rhythm | `prose-style.md` |\n| Pacing issues | `pacing.md` |\n| Weak opening | `openings.md` |\n| Unsatisfying ending | `endings.md` |\n| Genre expectations | `genre-conventions.md` |\n| Common mistakes | `anti-patterns.md` |\n\n---\n\n## For Nerds\n\n### Agents\n\n22 specialized agents, each tuned for a specific task:\n\n| Agent | Purpose | Model |\n|-------|---------|-------|\n| `writer` | Literary prose, chapters, scenes | opus |\n| `architect` | Story structure, premise, ending | opus |\n| `outliner` | Chapter breakdown, scene beats | sonnet |\n| `character-developer` | Character documents | opus |\n| `world-builder` | Settings, systems | sonnet |\n| `chapter-reviewer` | Iterative chapter review | sonnet |\n| `editor` | Line-level polish | sonnet |\n| `critique` | Full manuscript review | opus |\n| `synopsis` | Synopsis generation (short/medium/long) | opus |\n| `continuity` | Consistency checking | haiku |\n| `scene-analyzer` | Scene diagnosis | sonnet |\n| `voice-analyzer` | POV/tense consistency | sonnet |\n| `naming` | Title generation + availability | opus |\n| `cover-artist` | Image gen prompts | opus |\n| `next` | Project navigation | haiku |\n| `new-project` | Interactive project wizard | opus |\n| `reader-skim` | Fast fact extraction (parallel) | haiku |\n| `reader-careful` | Deep analysis with quotes (parallel) | sonnet |\n\n**Literary Critic Reviewers** (persona-based feedback):\n\n| Agent | Style |\n|-------|-------|\n| `james-wood` | New Yorker style, craft-focused |\n| `stephen-king` | Direct, story-first, hates adverbs |\n| `ursula-le-guin` | World-building, moral weight |\n| `roxane-gay` | Voice, representation, emotional truth |\n\n### Large Manuscript Efficiency\n\nFor 50k+ word novels (10+ chapters), specialized reader agents extract chapter data in parallel:\n\n| Task | Reader | Speedup |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| Synopsis generation | reader-skim / reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Full critique | reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Voice analysis | reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Editing all chapters | (direct parallel) | ~20× |\n| Reviewing all chapters | (direct parallel) | ~20× |\n| Continuity checking | (two-phase) | ~3-4× |\n\nReader agents return structured data that the parent agent synthesizes into final output.\n\n### Multi-Book Series Structure\n\n```\n/my-series\n├── README.md\n├── series/\n│   ├── series-architecture.md  # ⚓ Anchored series constraints\n│   ├── characters/\n│   └── world/\n└── book-1-title/\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── progress.md\n    ├── chapters/\n    ├── critiques/\n    ├── synopses/\n    └── builds/\n```\n\n### Cross-Reference System\n\nAll agents link to relevant craft references and related agents. No orphaned knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**Version:** 1.8.0 — See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n**Author:** Daniel Howells\n\n**License:** MIT\n"
