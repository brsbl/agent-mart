In Codex, use the closest equivalent:\n  - terminal exploration instead of `Task` blocks\n  - Playwright (or user-provided screenshots) instead of Claude-in-Chrome MCP\n\n## Claude Code Dependencies (Optional)\n\nArc uses these plugins for enhanced functionality:\n\n| Plugin | Used by |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Figma** | `/arc:ideate`, `/arc:implement`, `/arc:design` |\n| **Context7** | `/arc:implement` |\n| **Chrome** | `figma-implement` agent |\n\n```\n# Official plugins\n/plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official\n/plugin install context7@claude-plugins-official\n\n# Chrome extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-in-chrome/\n```\n\nArc works without these, but relevant features will be limited.\n\n**Note:** Arc maintains an activity log (`.arc/log.md`, gitignored) for knowledge persistence across sessions. Every skill auto-appends a brief entry on completion.\n\n### Optional: Vercel Labs Plugins\n\nThese plugins provide additional review capabilities:\n\n| Plugin | Skill | Used by |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| **[agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)** | `vercel-react-best-practices` | `/arc:implement`, `/arc:letsgo` |\n| | `vercel-composition-patterns` | `/arc:implement`, `/arc:design` |\n| | `vercel-react-native-skills` | `/arc:implement`, `/arc:letsgo`, `/arc:responsive` |\n| **[web-interface-guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines)** | `web-design-guidelines` | `/arc:design`, `/arc:implement`, `/arc:responsive` |\n\n```\n# Vercel Labs plugins (optional)\n/plugin marketplace add vercel-labs/agent-skills\n/plugin install agent-skills@vercel-labs-agent-skills\n\n/plugin marketplace add vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines\n/plugin install web-interface-guidelines@vercel-labs-web-interface-guidelines\n```\n\nWhen installed, Arc commands will automatically use these skills for React/Next.js performance reviews and UI compliance checks.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Claude Code\n\n### 1. Open your project\n\n```bash\ncd your-project\nclaude\n```\n\nThis starts an interactive Claude Code session in your terminal.\n\n### 2. Run a command\n\nCommands start with `/`. Type the command and press Enter:\n\n```\n/arc:ideate add user authentication with magic links\n```\n\nClaude will ask clarifying questions, explore your codebase, and create a design document.\n\n### 3. Follow the flow\n\nArc commands chain together. After `/arc:ideate` creates a design:\n- Claude asks if you want to continue to `/arc:implement` (plan and build)\n- Implementation creates its own plan, then executes with TDD\n\nYou can also jump in at any point if you already have docs.\n\n### Codex\n\n1. Open your project in Codex.\n2. Ensure `.agents/skills` is present (see [\"Using In Codex\"](#using-in-codex)).\n3. Run skills in chat, e.g. `$start` or `$ideate ...`.\n\n### Quick Examples\n\n```bash\n# Design a new feature (full flow)\n/arc:ideate add a notification system\n\n# Get suggestions for what to work on\n/arc:suggest\n\n# Ship to production\n/arc:letsgo\n```\n\n### Tips for Newcomers\n\n- **One question at a time** — Arc asks focused questions, not overwhelming lists\n- **You're in control** — Suggestions are questions, not mandates. Say no if you disagree.\n- **TDD by default** — Implementation writes tests first, then code\n- **Documents are created** — Plans go in `docs/plans/`, features in `docs/features/`\n\n## Primary Flow\n\nThe main entry point is `/arc:ideate`, which flows through to implementation:\n\n```\n/arc:ideate → /arc:implement\n```\n\nEach step asks if you want to continue. You can also enter at any point:\n- Have a design doc already? Start at `/arc:implement`\n- Have an implementation plan? `/arc:implement` will use it\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | When to use | Output |\n|---------|-------------|--------|\n| `/arc:go` | Main entry point, routes to workflow | Context-aware guidance |\n| `/arc:vision` | Starting a new project | `docs/vision.md` |\n| `/arc:ideate` | From idea to design doc | `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-design.md` |\n| `/arc:implement` | Plan + execute with TDD | Code changes |\n| `/arc:design` | UI/UX work | Wireframes + code |\n| `/arc:build` | Quick implementation | Code changes |\n| `/arc:testing` | Test strategy | Test files |\n| `/arc:letsgo` | Ship to production | Deployment |\n| `/arc:legal` | Generate legal pages | Privacy policy, ToS, cookies |\n| `/arc:review` | Review a plan for feasibility | Updated plan file |\n| `/arc:audit` | Comprehensive codebase audit | `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` |\n| `/arc:document` | Document features | `docs/features/<feature>.md` |\n| `/arc:suggest` | What to work on next (+ discovery mode) | Recommendations |\n| `/arc:naming` | Generate project names | Name candidates |\n| `/arc:commit` | Commit and push changes | Git commits |\n| `/arc:rules` | Apply coding standards | `.ruler/` directory |\n| `/arc:tidy` | Clean up completed plans | Archived/deleted plans |\n| `/arc:deps` | Dependency management | Updated dependencies |\n| `/arc:responsive` | Mobile responsive audit & fix | Responsive code changes |\n| `/arc:seo` | Deep SEO audit for web projects | `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-seo.md` |\n| `/arc:prune-agents` | Kill orphaned subagent processes | Clean process state |\n\n## Agents\n\nArc includes 22 specialized agents:\n\n| Category | Agents |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Research** | docs-researcher, git-history-analyzer, duplicate-detector, naming, feature-scout |\n| **Review** | architecture-engineer, simplicity-engineer, daniel-product-engineer, data-engineer, designer, lee-nextjs-engineer, hygiene-engineer, performance-engineer, security-engineer, senior-engineer, seo-engineer, accessibility-engineer, organization-engineer, test-quality-engineer |\n| **Build** | implementer, fixer, debugger, ui-builder, figma-builder, design-specifier, unit-test-writer, integration-test-writer, e2e-test-writer, test-runner, e2e-runner, spec-reviewer, code-reviewer |\n| **Design** | figma-implement |\n| **Workflow** | spec-flow-analyzer, e2e-test-runner, docs-writer |\n\n## Disciplines\n\nImplementation methodologies in `disciplines/`:\n\n- **test-driven-development** — Red-green-refactor cycle\n- **systematic-debugging** — Methodical bug investigation\n- **verification-before-completion** — Prove it works before claiming done\n- **using-git-worktrees** — Isolated development branches\n- **finishing-a-development-branch** — Cleanup after work complete\n- **subagent-driven-development** — Parallel agent execution\n- **dispatching-parallel-agents** — Efficient multi-agent coordination\n- **receiving-code-review** — Handling review feedback\n\n## Interop\n\nCommands work together:\n\n- `/arc:suggest` reads Linear issues (if configured), in-session tasks (TaskList), codebase, and `/arc:vision` (priority cascade with opt-in discovery mode)\n- `/arc:ideate` flows to `/arc:implement` (which creates plans internally)\n- `/arc:build` suggests `/arc:ideate` if scope is too large\n- `/arc:letsgo` runs `/arc:testing` and `/arc:audit --hygiene` as part of quality checks\n- Claude Code uses TaskList for in-session task tracking; Linear MCP for persistent issue tracking\n\n### Linear Integration (Optional)\n\nFor complex projects, Arc integrates with Linear via MCP for issue tracking:\n\n```json\n// .mcp.json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"linear\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@anthropic/linear-mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen Linear MCP is available, `/arc:suggest` queries active issues and `/arc:audit` can create issues from findings.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nArc builds on patterns and disciplines from:\n\n- [superpowers](https://github.com/chadgauth/superpowers) — Implementation disciplines (TDD, debugging, verification)\n- [compound-engineering](https://github.com/minuva/compound-engineering) — Agent patterns and workflows\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

Literary prose, iterative review, and craft-aware feedback.\n\n## What This Is\n\nA complete fiction writing system—from initial concept through final draft. Specialized agents handle different aspects of the craft: architecture, characters, prose, review, editing, continuity, and publishing prep.\n\nThis isn't a chatbot that writes generic content. It's a writing partner that understands story structure, character arcs, scene economy, and the difference between good prose and great prose.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugins:add howells/fiction\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### New Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:plan        # Design your story's architecture\n/fiction:character   # Develop your protagonist\n/fiction:outline     # Break into chapters\n\"Write chapter 1\"    # Start writing\n```\n\n### Existing Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:go          # Load project and see what to work on next\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/fiction:go` | Resume a project (load context + suggest what to do next) |\n| `/fiction:new` | Start a new fiction project from scratch |\n| `/fiction:plan` | Design story architecture (premise, theme, ending) |\n| `/fiction:outline` | Create chapter and scene breakdown |\n| `/fiction:character` | Develop a character document |\n| `/fiction:review` | Review current chapter |\n| `/fiction:critique` | Full manuscript review (NYT/New Yorker style) |\n| `/fiction:synopsis` | Generate synopsis (short/medium/long) |\n| `/fiction:edit` | Line-level editing (spelling, grammar, word echoes) |\n| `/fiction:naming` | Generate and validate book title options |\n| `/fiction:cover` | Generate cover art prompts for image generation |\n| `/fiction:build` | Build EPUB from your manuscript |\n| `/fiction:reconcile` | Update project to current plugin conventions |\n| `/fiction:next` | Get suggestion for what to work on next |\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n/my-novel\n├── README.md           # Overview, status, key decisions\n├── progress.md         # Session tracking, continuity state\n├── themes.md           # Central question, thematic content\n├── characters/         # Character documents\n├── world/              # Setting documents\n├── craft/              # Tone guide\n├── chapters/           # Chapter files\n├── critiques/          # Saved critiques\n├── synopses/           # Saved synopses\n├── builds/             # EPUB builds\n└── covers/             # Cover art iterations\n```\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\nFiction writing isn't linear—it's iterative. Here's how to use the plugin effectively:\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n\nStart with `/fiction:new` for a guided project setup, or build manually:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:plan          # Define premise, theme, ending, tone\n/fiction:character     # Develop protagonist and key characters\n/fiction:outline       # Break into chapters with scene beats\n```\n\n**Don't skip this.** A weak foundation creates problems that compound with every chapter. Know your ending before you start writing.\n\n### Phase 2: First Draft\n\nWrite chapters one at a time. After each chapter:\n\n```bash\n\"Write chapter 3\"      # Write the chapter\n/fiction:review        # Get craft-focused feedback\n# Revise based on feedback\n/fiction:review        # Review again if needed\n```\n\nThe review → revise → review loop is where the real work happens. Don't move on until a chapter is solid.\n\n### Phase 3: Polish\n\nOnce all chapters are drafted:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:edit          # Line-level editing (all chapters)\n/fiction:review        # Re-review after edits\n```\n\nThe editor catches spelling, grammar, word echoes, and awkward phrasing. Review again afterward—editing can introduce new issues.\n\n### Phase 4: Manuscript Review\n\nWhen the full draft is complete:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:critique      # Full manuscript critique (NYT/New Yorker style)\n```\n\nThis is a comprehensive review of the entire work: structure, character arcs, themes, pacing, prose quality. Use it to identify what needs revision before calling the manuscript done.\n\n### Phase 5: Publishing Prep\n\nWhen the manuscript is final:\n\n```bash\n/fiction:synopsis      # Generate query letter synopses\n/fiction:naming        # Find the right title\n/fiction:cover         # Generate cover art prompts\n/fiction:build         # Export to EPUB\n```\n\n### The Short Version\n\n```\n/fiction:new or /fiction:plan\n         ↓\n    Foundation work (characters, outline)\n         ↓\n┌──→ Write chapter\n│        ↓\n│    /fiction:review\n│        ↓\n└─── Revise (loop until solid)\n         ↓\n    /fiction:edit (all chapters)\n         ↓\n    /fiction:critique (full manuscript)\n         ↓\n    Publishing prep (synopsis, naming, cover, build)\n```\n\n### Returning to a Project\n\n```bash\n/fiction:go            # Load project and get recommendation for what to do next\n```\n\n## Core Principles\n\nThe plugin enforces these craft principles:\n\n1. **Story = Character + Change** — Plot is what happens; story is what it means\n2. **Scene Economy** — Every scene must do at least two things\n3. **Specificity Creates Universality** — Concrete details create resonance\n4. **Earned Moments** — Plant before harvest\n5. **Trust the Reader** — Show, don't tell. Imply, don't explain\n6. **Write for the Ear** — Modern books become audiobooks\n\n## Anchored Constraints\n\nMark immutable decisions with `## ⚓ Anchored` in any document. Review agents treat these as non-negotiable.\n\n```markdown\n## ⚓ Anchored\n\n- The protagonist never learns the truth about her father\n- The ending is ambiguous\n- No magic system explanations; it stays mysterious\n```\n\n## Craft References\n\n14 reference documents guide the writing and review process:\n\n| Problem | Reference |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Story feels aimless | `story-structure.md` |\n| Scene drags | `scene-structure.md` |\n| Flat characters | `character.md` |\n| Stilted dialogue | `dialogue.md` |\n| Prose lacks rhythm | `prose-style.md` |\n| Pacing issues | `pacing.md` |\n| Weak opening | `openings.md` |\n| Unsatisfying ending | `endings.md` |\n| Genre expectations | `genre-conventions.md` |\n| Common mistakes | `anti-patterns.md` |\n\n---\n\n## For Nerds\n\n### Agents\n\n22 specialized agents, each tuned for a specific task:\n\n| Agent | Purpose | Model |\n|-------|---------|-------|\n| `writer` | Literary prose, chapters, scenes | opus |\n| `architect` | Story structure, premise, ending | opus |\n| `outliner` | Chapter breakdown, scene beats | sonnet |\n| `character-developer` | Character documents | opus |\n| `world-builder` | Settings, systems | sonnet |\n| `chapter-reviewer` | Iterative chapter review | sonnet |\n| `editor` | Line-level polish | sonnet |\n| `critique` | Full manuscript review | opus |\n| `synopsis` | Synopsis generation (short/medium/long) | opus |\n| `continuity` | Consistency checking | haiku |\n| `scene-analyzer` | Scene diagnosis | sonnet |\n| `voice-analyzer` | POV/tense consistency | sonnet |\n| `naming` | Title generation + availability | opus |\n| `cover-artist` | Image gen prompts | opus |\n| `next` | Project navigation | haiku |\n| `new-project` | Interactive project wizard | opus |\n| `reader-skim` | Fast fact extraction (parallel) | haiku |\n| `reader-careful` | Deep analysis with quotes (parallel) | sonnet |\n\n**Literary Critic Reviewers** (persona-based feedback):\n\n| Agent | Style |\n|-------|-------|\n| `james-wood` | New Yorker style, craft-focused |\n| `stephen-king` | Direct, story-first, hates adverbs |\n| `ursula-le-guin` | World-building, moral weight |\n| `roxane-gay` | Voice, representation, emotional truth |\n\n### Large Manuscript Efficiency\n\nFor 50k+ word novels (10+ chapters), specialized reader agents extract chapter data in parallel:\n\n| Task | Reader | Speedup |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| Synopsis generation | reader-skim / reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Full critique | reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Voice analysis | reader-careful | ~3-4× |\n| Editing all chapters | (direct parallel) | ~20× |\n| Reviewing all chapters | (direct parallel) | ~20× |\n| Continuity checking | (two-phase) | ~3-4× |\n\nReader agents return structured data that the parent agent synthesizes into final output.\n\n### Multi-Book Series Structure\n\n```\n/my-series\n├── README.md\n├── series/\n│   ├── series-architecture.md  # ⚓ Anchored series constraints\n│   ├── characters/\n│   └── world/\n└── book-1-title/\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── progress.md\n    ├── chapters/\n    ├── critiques/\n    ├── synopses/\n    └── builds/\n```\n\n### Cross-Reference System\n\nAll agents link to relevant craft references and related agents.
