        "README.md": "# Claude Skills Marketplace\n\nA marketplace for Claude Agent Skills - organized packages of instructions, scripts, and resources that extend Claude's capabilities.\n\n## What Are Skills?\n\nAgent Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file that packages domain expertise and organizational knowledge for reuse across conversations. They enable Claude to perform specialized tasks by loading instructions, scripts, and resources dynamically.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on the description\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Only loads content when needed, optimizing token usage\n- **Composable**: Multiple focused skills work better together than one comprehensive skill\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Create Your Skill Directory\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Required - core instructions\n├── reference.md       # Optional - additional documentation\n├── examples.md        # Optional - usage examples\n├── scripts/           # Optional - executable code\n└── templates/         # Optional - template files\n```\n\n### 2. Write Your SKILL.md\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\nProvide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.\n\n## Examples\nShow concrete usage examples with inputs and outputs.\n\n## Guidelines\nBest practices and constraints.\n```\n\n### 3. Install Your Skill\n\n| Location | Scope |\n|----------|-------|\n| `~/.claude/skills/` | Personal - available across all projects |\n| `.claude/skills/` | Project - specific to repository |\n\n## SKILL.md Metadata Reference\n\n| Field | Required | Constraints |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only |\n| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars, explains function and trigger conditions |\n| `version` | No | Semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0) |\n| `dependencies` | No | List of required packages |\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Architecture\n\nSkills implement three levels of information loading:\n\n1. **Level 1 (Metadata)**: Name/description loaded into system prompt at startup\n2. **Level 2 (Instructions)**: Full SKILL.md loads when Claude determines relevance\n3. **Level 3+ (Resources)**: Additional files load only when referenced\n\nThis design keeps context consumption minimal while enabling unbounded skill complexity.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Focus**: Create separate skills for different workflows\n- **Clarity**: Write specific descriptions for proper invocation\n- **Simplicity**: Start with markdown; add code only when needed\n- **Examples**: Include sample inputs and outputs\n- **Versioning**: Track changes systematically\n- **Incremental Testing**: Test after each significant change\n- **Scale Structure**: Split into separate files when SKILL.md grows unwieldy\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Install skills only from trusted sources\n- Audit bundled files and dependencies\n- Never hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords)\n- Review instructions directing Claude toward external connections\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nclaude-skills-marketplace/\n├── skills/                    # Community skills\n│   ├── creative/              # Creative & design skills\n│   ├── development/           # Development & technical skills\n│   ├── enterprise/            # Enterprise & communication skills\n│   └── document/              # Document generation skills\n├── templates/                 # Starter templates\n│   └── basic/\n│       └── SKILL.md\n├── docs/                      # Documentation\n│   ├── CREATING_SKILLS.md\n│   ├── API_SKILLS.md\n│   └── SKILLS_BEST_PRACTICES.md\n└── CONTRIBUTING.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting skills to the marketplace.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Introducing Agent Skills | Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills)\n- [How to create custom Skills | Claude Help Center](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills)\n- [GitHub - anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)\n- [Equipping agents for the real world | Anthropic Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
