        "README.md": "# Dark Matter Marketplace\n\nA personal Claude Code plugin marketplace for workflows, skills, and agents that I use daily.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**This is my personal repo.** It reflects my workflows, preferences, and experiments. YMMV.\n\n- Changes frequently, often without notice\n- Often in an experimental state\n- May contain half-baked ideas alongside polished tools\n- Not designed for general consumption, but you're welcome to browse\n\nIf something here is useful to you, great. If not, no worries.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add rbergman/dark-matter-marketplace\n\n# Install plugins\nclaude plugin install dm-work@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-lang@dark-matter-marketplace\n# ... or any other dm-* plugin\n\n# Update after changes\nclaude plugin marketplace update dark-matter-marketplace\n```\n\n---\n\n## Naming Convention\n\nAll components use the `dm-*` plugin prefix with semantic groupings:\n\n| Plugin | Prefix | Example |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| dm-arch | Architecture patterns | `dm-arch:solid-architecture` |\n| dm-drvr | External AI drivers | `dm-drvr:codex-driver` |\n| dm-game | Game development | `dm-game:game-design` |\n| dm-lang | Language expertise | `dm-lang:typescript-pro` |\n| dm-tool | Tool design patterns | `dm-tool:agent-dx-cli` |\n| dm-work | Workflow tools | `dm-work:orchestrator` |\n\nCommands use `/dm-work:command` format (e.g., `/dm-work:snapshot`).\n\n---\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\ndark-matter-marketplace/\n├── plugins/           # Installable Claude Code plugins\n│   ├── architecture/  # dm-arch:

plugin marketplace update dark-matter-marketplace\n\n# Install plugins\nclaude plugin install dm-arch@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-drvr@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-game@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-lang@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-tool@dark-matter-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dm-work@dark-matter-marketplace\n```\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nSee `references/workflow.md` for the full workflow, but the core ideas:\n\n1. **Orchestrator model** — You strategize, Claude orchestrates, subagents implement\n2. **Context is precious** — Delegate to preserve it; checkpoint to manage it\n3. **External state** — Use beads to track work outside the conversation\n4. **One compaction max** — Multiple compactions compound information loss\n\n### Developer Experience (DX)\n\nThe plugins include opinionated DX tooling that works together:\n\n| Tool | Skill | Purpose |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) | `dm-work:mise` | Version management for all languages/tools — replaces nvm, pyenv, goenv |\n| [just](https://just.systems) | `dm-lang:just-pro` | Command runner — consistent `just check`, `just setup` across projects |\n| CLI tools | `dm-work:cli-tools` | fd, rg, jq, yq, sd, bat, delta — power tools when built-ins aren't enough |\n| [srt](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime) | `dm-work:srt` | Sandbox Runtime — OS-level isolation for CLI/autonomous runs (use `/sandbox` for interactive) |\n\n**The pattern**: Projects have a `.mise.toml` (pinned versions) and `justfile` (commands). Setup is always `just setup` → runs `mise trust && mise install` + language deps. This ensures reproducible environments without requiring devs to configure their shells.\n\n### Beads\n\n[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) is the issue tracking CLI I use, and it appears throughout these plugins. It's a critical part of my workflow — providing external state that survives session boundaries, enabling orchestrators to track progress across compactions, and giving subagents clear work items to implement.\n\nReferences to `bd` CLI, bead IDs (like `whiteout-4eed`), and bead states (`ready`, `claimed`, `done`) appear in many skills and agents. If you're not using beads, you can substitute your own issue tracking system or ignore those references.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nDo whatever you want. No warranties, no support, no guarantees.\n"
