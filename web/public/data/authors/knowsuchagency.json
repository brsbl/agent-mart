Leverage Your Time Wisely.**\n\n![Fulcrum Kanban Board with AI Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/kanban-with-assistant-dark.png)\n\n## What It Does\n\nFulcrum is your AI-powered command center for shipping software. Built for technical solopreneurs and CTOs who need to multiply their leverage—not just chase the latest coding trend.\n\nRun Claude Code across multiple tasks in parallel. Choose Git worktrees for isolated code work, Scratch directories for non-git AI agent sessions, or Manual tasks for anything else. Stay connected to your agents via WhatsApp, Email, Discord, Telegram, or Slack. Let your AI assistant monitor messages, filter signal from noise, and send daily briefings—all while you focus on what matters.\n\nFulcrum doesn't replace your tools—it gives you leverage over them. You configure Claude Code with the integrations you need (Notion, Linear, Stripe, whatever). Fulcrum is your window into Claude Code and a literal fulcrum: a small input that moves mountains.\n\n**Six pillars:**\n\n- **Claude Code Ecosystem** — Deep integration with Claude Code. Connect via messaging channels, manage tasks, deploy from one dashboard.\n- **Proactive AI Concierge** — Your assistant monitors messages, stores important observations as memories, creates daily plans, and sends morning/evening briefings automatically.\n- **Work From Anywhere** — Run Fulcrum on a remote server. Close your laptop, agents keep working.\n- **Project Management** — Tasks with dependencies, due dates, time estimates, priority levels, recurrence, labels, and attachments. Visual kanban boards.\n- **Production Deployment** — Docker Compose with automatic Traefik routing and Cloudflare DNS/tunnels.\n- **Agent Memory** — Persistent knowledge store with full-text search. Agents remember across sessions.\n- **MCP-First Architecture** — 100+ tools exposed via Model Context Protocol. Agents discover what they need.\n\n## MCP-First Architecture\n\nEverything in Fulcrum is exposed through MCP (Model Context Protocol):\n\n- **100+ MCP tools** for tasks, projects, apps, repos, notifications, and remote execution\n- **Smart tool discovery** — `search_tools` lets agents find relevant tools without loading everything into context\n- **Integrated assistant** — Built-in AI assistant with full context of your tasks, projects, and apps\n- **External agent support** — Connect Claude Desktop, Clawdbot, or any MCP-compatible agent\n- **No context bloat** — Agents discover and use only the tools they need\n\nWhether you use Fulcrum's built-in assistant or an external agent like Claude Desktop, AI has seamless access to your entire workflow.\n\n## Proactive Digital Concierge\n\nFulcrum's AI assistant doesn't just respond—it actively monitors and manages your workflow.\n\n### Intelligent Message Handling\n\nWhen messages arrive via Email, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, or Slack:\n\n- **Actionable requests** (deadlines, meetings, tasks) → Creates Fulcrum tasks and stores as memories with `actionable` tag\n- **Casual conversations** → Responded to naturally, no tracking overhead\n- **Spam/newsletters** → Silently ignored\n\n### Persistent Memory\n\nImportant observations are stored as **memories** with tags like `actionable` or `monitoring`—searchable via full-text search, with recency-weighted results so recent items surface first.\n\n### Daily Planning\n\nYour assistant creates and reviews daily plans automatically:\n\n- **Evening** — Creates tomorrow's plan based on pending tasks and events, saves to your documents folder\n- **Morning** — Reviews the plan, compares against current state, sends prioritized briefing\n\nPlans persist as markdown files you can edit or review anytime.\n\n### Scheduled Briefings\n\nConfigure morning and evening rituals in Settings:\n\n- **Morning briefing** — Reviews yesterday's plan, prioritizes today's tasks and events\n- **Evening recap** — What got done, what's blocked, creates tomorrow's plan\n\nBriefings are sent to your preferred messaging channel automatically.\n\n### Hourly Sweeps\n\nEvery hour, your assistant reviews pending events, checks on blocked or overdue tasks, and catches patterns across messages. Nothing slips through the cracks.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nnpx @knowsuchagency/fulcrum@latest up\n```\n\nFulcrum will check for dependencies (bun, dtach, fnox, age, AI agent CLI), offer to install any that are missing, set up encrypted secret storage, and start the server on http://localhost:7777.\n\n### Desktop App\n\n| Platform | Download |\n|----------|----------|\n| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [Download DMG](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/releases/latest/download/Fulcrum-macos-arm64.dmg) |\n| **Linux** | [Download AppImage](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/releases/latest/download/Fulcrum-linux-x64.AppImage) |\n\nThe desktop app bundles everything—just install and run.\n\n<details>\n<summary>macOS Installation Notes</summary>\n\n1. Open the DMG and drag Fulcrum to Applications\n2. On first launch, macOS will block the app\n3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**\n4. Confirm by clicking **Open Anyway** in the dialog\n\n</details>\n\n### Install Script (Remote Servers)\n\nFor remote servers or VPS, use the install script—it auto-installs all dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Claude Code Plugin\n\nInstall the plugin for automatic status sync and task management:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add knowsuchagency/fulcrum\nclaude plugin install fulcrum@fulcrum --scope user\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Kanban Board & AI Assistant\n\nTrack tasks from planning to done. Set priority levels (high/medium/low), pin important tasks to the top of lists, and set up recurring tasks that auto-create the next occurrence when completed. The built-in AI assistant has full context of everything you're tracking—tasks, projects, apps—and can help with planning, documentation, or running MCP tools.\n\n![Kanban Board with AI Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/kanban-with-assistant-dark.png)\n\n### Task Types\n\nThree task types for different workflows:\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Git** | Isolated git worktree with AI agent — for code changes with branch isolation |\n| **Scratch** | Isolated directory with AI agent — for non-git work (scripts, analysis, experiments) |\n| **Manual** | No agent, no directory — for tracking work done outside Fulcrum |\n\n### Parallel Agent Orchestration\n\nRun multiple AI coding agents simultaneously across different tasks. Git tasks get isolated worktrees, Scratch tasks get isolated directories. Monitor and interact with all sessions from one screen.\n\n![Parallel Agent Terminals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/parallel-agent-terminals-dark.png)\n\n### Projects\n\nUnified view of repositories and deployments. Link repos, manage tasks, configure default agents, and see active work at a glance.\n\n![Projects List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/projects-list-dark.png)\n\n### Project Workspace\n\nTerminal with integrated file browser. Direct access to project files alongside your agent sessions.\n\n![Project Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/project-workspace-dark.png)\n\n### Task Dependencies\n\nDefine prerequisite tasks that must complete before others can start. Visualize with an interactive dependency graph.\n\n![Task Dependency Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/task-dependency-graph-dark.png)\n\n### AI Assistant\n\nCreate documents with live preview. Generate charts and visualizations. The assistant uses the same MCP tools available to external agents.\n\n![AI Assistant Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/assistant-editor-dark.png)\n\n### Calendar Integration\n\nConnect multiple calendar accounts so the AI assistant knows your schedule. Calendar has its own top-level page (`/calendar`, Cmd+7) with month and week views, project and tag filters.\n\n- **Google Calendar** — Direct Google API integration via OAuth2 (recommended)\n- **Any CalDAV server** — Nextcloud, Radicale, Baikal, iCloud\n- **Multiple accounts** — Add as many accounts as you need\n- **Automatic sync** — Each account syncs independently on a configurable interval\n- **Weekly view** — Google Calendar-style week view with time axis, overlapping event layout, and current time indicator\n- **One-way event copying** — Copy events between calendars across accounts via configurable rules\n- **Due date colors** — Red (overdue), orange (today), yellow (tomorrow) visual indicators\n- **Assistant awareness** — The AI assistant uses your calendar context for planning and scheduling\n\nEnable in Settings → Calendar.\n\n### Messaging Integrations\n\nChat with the AI assistant from anywhere via your favorite messaging platform.\n\n| Platform | Auth Method |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Email** | Gmail API (OAuth2) or IMAP/SMTP credentials; collects all emails, allowlist controls AI responses |\n| **WhatsApp** | QR code scan, monitors all messages, replies only to \"Message yourself\" |\n| **Discord** | Bot token from Developer Portal |\n| **Telegram** | Bot token from @BotFather |\n| **Slack** | Bot + App tokens with Socket Mode |\n| **Gmail** | OAuth2, sends emails to your own address |\n\n- **User-only messaging** — Outbound messages restricted to user's own accounts (no third-party messaging)\n- **Persistent sessions** — Conversation context maintained across messages\n- **Email threading** — Each email thread is a separate conversation\n- **Observe-first** — Email and WhatsApp collect all messages but only respond to authorized senders\n- **Commands** — `/reset` (new conversation), `/help`, `/status`\n\nEnable in Settings → Email & Messaging and follow the setup instructions for each platform.\n\n### Agent Memory\n\nA two-tier memory system gives agents both always-on context and on-demand recall:\n\n**Master Memory File** (`~/.fulcrum/MEMORY.md`) — A structured markdown document injected into every system prompt. Use it for user preferences, project context, architecture decisions, and standing instructions. Editable from the Assistant > Memory tab or via MCP tools.\n\n**Ephemeral Memories** — Individual tagged facts stored in SQLite with FTS5 full-text search. Use for transient observations, action items, and channel-sourced data points.\n\n- **Always in context** — Memory file content is included in every conversation automatically\n- **Searchable** — Full-text search with boolean operators, phrase matching, and prefix queries\n- **Tagged** — Categorize ephemeral memories with tags (preferences, decisions, architecture, etc.)\n- **Browsable** — View, search, edit, and delete memories from the Monitoring > Memory tab\n- **MCP tools** — `memory_file_read`/`memory_file_update` for the master file, `memory_store` for ephemeral facts, unified `search` for cross-entity queries\n\n### System Monitoring\n\nTrack CPU, memory, and disk usage while your agents work. Jobs is a top-level page (`/jobs`, Cmd+6) for managing systemd (Linux) or launchd (macOS) timers. The Messages tab under Monitoring shows all channel messages (WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, Slack, Email) with filtering by channel and direction. The Observer tab tracks every observe-only message processing attempt with circuit breaker status, aggregate stats, and a filterable invocations list.\n\n![System Monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/fulcrum/main/screenshots/system-monitoring-dark.png)\n\n## Supported Agents\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Claude Code** | Anthropic's CLI coding agent with deep MCP integration |\n| **OpenCode** | Open-source coding agent with GPT-4 and other model support |\n\nConfigure your default agent globally, per-repository, or per-task.\n\n## Claude Code Plugin\n\nThe Fulcrum plugin enables seamless integration:\n\n- **Automatic Status Sync** — Task moves to \"In Review\" when Claude stops, \"In Progress\" when you respond\n- **Session Continuity** — Sessions tied to task IDs\n- **MCP Server** — Task management tools available directly to Claude\n- **Slash Commands** — `/review`, `/pr`, `/notify`, `/linear`, `/task-info`\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add knowsuchagency/fulcrum\nclaude plugin install fulcrum@fulcrum --scope user\n```\n\n## OpenCode Integration\n\n```bash\nfulcrum opencode install    # Install plugin + MCP server\nfulcrum opencode uninstall  # Remove both\n```\n\n## MCP Tools\n\nBoth plugins include an MCP server with 100+ tools:\n\n| Category | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Tasks** | Create, update, move tasks; manage links, labels, attachments, due dates, time estimates, priority, recurrence |\n| **Task Dependencies** | Define prerequisite tasks; visualize with dependency graph |\n| **Projects** | Manage projects with tags, notes, and file attachments |\n| **Repositories** | Add, configure, and link repositories to projects |\n| **Apps** | Deploy, stop, and monitor Docker Compose applications |\n| **Filesystem** | Browse directories, read/write files on the Fulcrum server |\n| **Execution** | Run shell commands with persistent session support |\n| **Notifications** | Send notifications to enabled channels (Slack, Discord, Pushover, WhatsApp, Telegram, Gmail) |\n| **Backup & Restore** | Snapshot database and settings; auto-safety-backup on restore |\n| **Settings** | View and update configuration; manage notification channels |\n| **Search** | Unified full-text search across tasks, projects, messages, events, memories, and conversations |\n| **Memory** | Read/update master memory file; store ephemeral knowledge with tags |\n| **Calendar** | Manage CalDAV accounts, sync calendars, configure event copy rules |\n| **Gmail** | List Google accounts, manage Gmail drafts, send emails |\n| **Assistant** | Send messages via channels (WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, Slack, Gmail); query sweep history |\n\nUse `search_tools` to discover available tools by keyword or category.\n\nFor Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"fulcrum\": {\n      \"command\": \"fulcrum\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Remote Server Setup\n\nRun the backend on a remote server and connect from anywhere. Launch tasks, close your laptop, and your agents keep working.\n\n### SSH Port Forwarding (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Forward local port 7777 to remote server's port 7777\nssh -L 7777:localhost:7777 your-server\n\n# Or run in background with keep-alive\nssh -fN -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -L 7777:localhost:7777 your-server\n```\n\nOn the remote server:\n```bash\nnpx @knowsuchagency/fulcrum@latest up\n```\n\nThe desktop app connects through the tunnel automatically. This is secure (no exposed ports), performant (direct SSH), and simple (no extra config).\n\n### Browser Access\n\nFor browser-only access, use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnels to expose your server.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>\n\nSensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, webhook URLs) are encrypted using [fnox](https://github.com/yarlson/fnox) with age encryption. The age key and encrypted secrets live in the fulcrum directory (`age.txt` and `fnox.toml`). Non-sensitive settings are stored in `settings.json`. Existing plain-text secrets are automatically migrated to fnox on server start.\n\nSettings are stored in `.fulcrum/settings.json`. The fulcrum directory is resolved in this order:\n\n1. `FULCRUM_DIR` environment variable\n2. `.fulcrum` in current working directory\n3. `~/.fulcrum` (default)\n\n| Setting | Env Var | Default |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| server.port | `PORT` | 7777 |\n| paths.defaultGitReposDir | `FULCRUM_GIT_REPOS_DIR` | ~ |\n| editor.sshPort | `FULCRUM_SSH_PORT` | 22 |\n| integrations.linearApiKey | `LINEAR_API_KEY` | null |\n| integrations.githubPat | `GITHUB_PAT` | null |\n| appearance.language | — | null (auto-detect) |\n\nNotification settings (sound, Slack, Discord, Pushover, WhatsApp, Telegram, Gmail) are configured via Settings UI or CLI.\n\n### Linear Integration\n\nSync task status with Linear tickets.
