Since v1.10.7, the codebase grew 33% (12,181 to 16,154 lines) and the script count tripled (23 to 63), yet per-request overhead *decreased* 7% — because every new capability is shell-only. The 40 new scripts (V2 protocol enforcement, V3 feature flags, test harness, bootstrap) execute as bash subprocesses at zero model token cost. Vibe consolidation replaced 10 commands with a single `/vbw:vibe`, shrinking the active command footprint. The result: 8,807 lines of bash infrastructure the model never sees, across 21 commands, 6 agents, and 11 reference files.\n\nStock teams load all command descriptions into every request, run every agent on Opus, coordinate via expensive message round-trips, and let each agent independently discover project state by reading the same files. VBW replaces all of that with shell pre-computation, deterministic context routing via `compile-context.sh`, configurable model profiles (Scout on Haiku, QA on Sonnet), disk-based coordination, pre-computed state injection, 22 feature-flagged shell hooks, and terse compressed instructions.\n\n| Category | Stock Agent Teams | VBW | Saving |\n| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| Base context overhead | 10,800 tokens | 1,800 tokens | **83%** |\n| State computation per command | 1,300 tokens | 200 tokens | **85%** |\n| Agent coordination (x4 agents) | 16,000 tokens | 1,500 tokens | **91%** |\n| Compaction recovery | 5,000 tokens | 700 tokens | **86%** |\n| Context duplication (shared files) | 16,500 tokens | 900 tokens | **95%** |\n| Agent model cost per phase | $2.78 | $1.40 | **50%** |\n| **Total coordination overhead** | **87,100 tokens** | **13,100 tokens** | **85%** |\n\nThe five highest-impact optimizations: `compile-context.sh` (470 lines, 6 roles) produces role-specific context files so each agent loads only what its role needs — Lead gets filtered requirements, Dev gets phase goal + conventions + delta files, QA gets verification targets, Scout/Debugger/Architect get scoped research context; `disable-model-invocation` on 15 of 21 commands removes ~9,000 tokens from every API request; vibe consolidation replaced 10 active commands with 1 (`vibe.md`), cutting per-request overhead by 915 tokens; model routing sends Scout to Haiku (60x cheaper than Opus) and QA to Sonnet (5x cheaper), with 3 preset profiles (Quality/Balanced/Budget) and per-agent overrides; and 63 shell scripts handle state computation, protocol enforcement, security filtering, and session lifecycle at zero model token cost.\n\n**What this means for your bill:**\n\nEach VBW phase eliminates ~85% of the coordination tokens stock teams burn on context loading, state recomputation, and agent bootstrapping. Model routing stacks additional savings on top: Scout on Haiku (60x cheaper than Opus), QA on Sonnet (5x cheaper), with three presets from conservative to aggressive. For API users, per-phase cost drops from $2.78 to $1.40 (Balanced) or $0.70 (Budget). For subscription plans, the structural efficiency stretches your rate limit budget ~2.5x further — **150% more development capacity for the same price**.\n\n| Scenario | Without VBW | With VBW (Balanced) | Impact |\n| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| API: single project (10 phases) | ~$28 | ~$14 | **~$14 saved** |\n| API: active dev (20 phases/mo) | ~$56/mo | ~$28/mo | **~$28/mo saved (~$336/yr)** |\n| API: heavy dev (50 phases/mo) | ~$139/mo | ~$70/mo | **~$69/mo saved (~$828/yr)** |\n| API: team (100 phases/mo) | ~$278/mo | ~$139/mo | **~$139/mo saved (~$1,668/yr)** |\n| Pro ($20/mo) | baseline capacity | ~2.5x phases per cycle | **150% more work done** |\n| Pro annual ($17/mo) | baseline capacity | ~2.5x phases per cycle | **150% more work done** |\n| Max 5x ($100/mo) | 5x Pro capacity | ~12.5x vs base Pro | **150% more work done** |\n| Max 20x ($200/mo) | 20x Pro capacity | ~50x vs base Pro | **150% more work done** |\n\n*API projections use Balanced profile ($1.40/phase vs $2.78 stock). Budget profile ($0.70/phase) doubles these savings — ~$104/mo on heavy dev (~$1,248/yr), ~$209/mo for teams (~$2,508/yr). Quality profile ($2.80/phase) matches stock agent costs but adds V2/V3 protocol enforcement, typed handoffs, and continuous verification at zero cost premium — same bill, better process. Subscription plans have a flat fee — VBW doesn't change what you pay, but ~85% less overhead means ~2.5x more phases per rate limit cycle regardless of model profile.

And your results will be significantly better than using an IDE with a chatbot.\n\n**For seasoned developers:** Four effort profiles control agent depth and cost tradeoff. Four autonomy levels gate confirmation prompts from cautious (plan approval at balanced effort) to pure-vibe (full phase looping, zero stops). Verification tiers scale from quick sanity checks to deep goal-backward QA. Work profiles bundle effort, autonomy, and verification into switchable presets. Model routing pins Scout to Haiku and QA to Sonnet while Dev runs on Opus. Skill-hook wiring lets you trigger installed skills on PostToolUse and PreToolUse events with custom matchers. Convention enforcement auto-detects your codebase patterns during init and injects them into every agent's context via `compile-context.sh`. Platform-enforced `disallowedTools` on 4 of 6 agents, not prompt-based restrictions. The beginners get guardrails; you get a control surface.\n\n**For contributors:** VBW is a living project. The plugin system, the agents, the verification pipeline - all of it is open to improvement. If you've found a better way to plan, build, or verify code with Claude, bring it. File an issue, open a PR, or just show up and share what you've learned. Every contribution makes the next person's experience better.\n\n**For vibe coders:** You don't need to know how VBW works under the hood to get help with your projects. Come to the Discord, share what you're building, ask questions, get unstuck. No gatekeeping, no judgment. We've all stared at a terminal wondering what just happened. The difference is now you don't have to stare alone.\n\n**[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/zh6pV53SaP)** -- whether you want to help build VBW or just want VBW to help you build.\n\n<br>\n\n## What Is This\n\n> **Platform:** macOS and Linux only. Windows is not supported natively — all hooks, scripts, and context blocks require bash. If you're on Windows, run Claude Code inside [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n\nInspired by **[Ralph](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code)** and **[Get Shit Done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)**, however, an entirely new architecture.\n\nVBW is a Claude Code plugin that bolts an actual development lifecycle onto your vibe coding sessions.\n\nYou describe what you want. VBW breaks it into phases. Agents plan, write, and verify the code. Commits are atomic. Verification is goal-backward. State persists across sessions. It's the entire software development lifecycle, except you replaced the engineering team with a plugin and a prayer.\n\nThink of it as project management for the post-dignity era of software development.\n\n<br>\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [VBW Token Efficiency vs Stock Opus 4.6 Agent Teams](#vbw-token-efficiency-vs-stock-opus-46-agent-teams)\n- [Manifesto](#manifesto)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [How It Works](#how-it-works)\n- [Quick Tutorial](#quick-tutorial)\n- [Commands](#commands)\n- [The Agents](#the-agents)\n- [Effort Profiles](#effort-profiles)\n- [Autonomy Levels](#autonomy-levels)\n- [What You Get Versus Raw Claude Code](#what-you-get-versus-raw-claude-code)\n- [Project Structure](#project-structure)\n- [Under the Hood](#under-the-hood)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Features\n\n### Built for Opus 4.6+, not bolted onto it\n\nMost Claude Code plugins were built for the subagent era, one main session spawning helper agents that report back and die. Much like the codebases they produce. VBW is designed from the ground up for the platform features that changed the game:\n\n- **Agent Teams for real parallelism.** `/vbw:vibe` creates a team of Dev teammates that execute tasks concurrently, each in their own context window. `/vbw:map` runs 4 Scout teammates in parallel to analyze your codebase. This isn't \"spawn a subagent and wait\" -- it's coordinated teamwork with a shared task list and direct inter-agent communication.\n\n- **Native hooks for continuous verification.** 21 hooks across 11 event types run automatically -- validating SUMMARY.md structure, checking commit format, validating frontmatter descriptions, gating task completion, blocking sensitive file access, enforcing plan file boundaries, managing session lifecycle, tracking agent lifecycle and cost attribution, tracking session metrics, pre-flight prompt validation, and post-compaction context verification. No more spawning a QA agent after every task. The platform enforces it, not the prompt.\n\n- **Platform-enforced tool permissions.** Each agent has `tools`/`disallowedTools` in their YAML frontmatter -- 4 of 6 agents have platform-enforced deny lists. Scout and QA literally cannot write files. Sensitive file access (`.env`, credentials) is intercepted by the `security-filter` hook. `disallowedTools` is enforced by Claude Code itself, not by instructions an agent might ignore during compaction.\n\n- **Structured handoff schemas.** Agents communicate via JSON-structured SendMessage with typed schemas (`scout_findings`, `dev_progress`, `dev_blocker`, `qa_result`, `debugger_report`). No more hoping the receiving agent can parse free-form markdown. Schema definitions live in a single reference document with backward-compatible fallback to plain text.\n\n<br>\n\n### Solves Agent Teams limitations out of the box\n\nAgent Teams are [experimental with known limitations](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams#limitations). VBW handles them so you don't have to:\n\n- **Session resumption.** Agent Teams teammates don't survive `/resume`. VBW's `/vbw:resume` reads ground truth directly from `.vbw-planning/` -- STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files -- without requiring a prior `/vbw:pause`. It detects interrupted builds via `.execution-state.json`, reconciles stale execution state by detecting tasks completed between sessions via SUMMARY.md files, and suggests the right next action.\n\n- **Task status lag.** Teammates sometimes forget to mark tasks complete. VBW's `TaskCompleted` hook verifies task-related commits exist via keyword matching. The `TeammateIdle` hook runs a tiered SUMMARY.md gate — all summaries present passes immediately, conventional commit format only grants a 1-plan grace period, and 2+ missing summaries block regardless.\n\n- **Shutdown coordination.** Claude Code's platform handles teammate cleanup when sessions end. VBW's hooks ensure verification runs before teammates go idle.\n\n- **File conflicts.** Plans decompose work into tasks with explicit file ownership. Dev teammates operate on disjoint file sets by design, enforced at runtime by the `file-guard.sh` hook that blocks writes to files not declared in the active plan.\n\nAgent Teams ship with seven known limitations. VBW addresses all of them. The eighth... that you're using AI to write software doesn't need a fix. It needs an intervention.\n\n<br>\n\n### Skills.sh integration\n\nVBW integrates with [Skills.sh](https://skills.sh), the open-source skill registry for AI agents with 20+ supported platforms and thousands of community-contributed skills:\n\n- **Automatic stack detection.** `/vbw:init` scans your project during setup, identifies your tech stack (Next.js, Django, Prisma, Tailwind, etc.), and recommends relevant skills from a curated mapping.\n\n- **On-demand skill discovery.** Run `/vbw:skills` anytime to detect your stack, browse curated suggestions, search the Skills.sh registry, and install skills in one step. Use `--search <query>` for direct registry lookups.\n\n<br>\n\n### Real-time statusline that knows more about your project than you do\n\n<img src=\"assets/statusline.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nFive or six lines of pure situational awareness, rendered after every response. Phase progress, plan completion, effort profile, QA status... everything a senior engineer would track on a whiteboard, except the whiteboard has been replaced by a terminal and the senior engineer has been replaced by you.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nOpen Claude Code and run these two commands inside the Claude Code session, **one at a time**:\n\n**Step 1:** Add the marketplace\n```\n/plugin marketplace add yidakee/vibe-better-with-claude-code-vbw\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Install the plugin\n```\n/plugin install vbw@vbw-marketplace\n```\n\nThat's it. Two commands, two separate inputs. Do not paste them together — Claude Code will treat both lines as a single command and the URL will break.\n\nTo update later, inside Claude Code:\n\n```\n/vbw:update\n```\n\n### Running VBW\n\n**Option A: Supervised mode** (recommended for the cautious)\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\nClaude Code will ask permission before file writes, bash commands, etc. You approve once per tool, per project -- it remembers after that. VBW has its own security layer (agent tool permissions, file access hooks), so the permission prompts are a second safety net. First session has some clicking. After that, smooth sailing.\n\n**Option B: Full auto mode** (recommended for the brave)\n\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\nNo permission prompts. No interruptions. Agents run uninterrupted until the work is done or your API budget isn't. VBW's built-in security controls (read-only agents can't write, `security-filter.sh` blocks `.env` and credentials, QA gates on every task) still apply. The platform just stops asking \"are you sure?\" every time an agent wants to create a file.\n\nThis is how most vibe coders run it. The agents work longer, the flow stays unbroken, and you get to pretend you're supervising while scrolling Twitter.\n\n> **Disclaimer:** The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag is called that for a reason. It is not called `--everything-will-be-fine` or `--trust-the-AI-it-knows-what-its-doing`. By using it, you are giving an AI unsupervised write access to your filesystem. VBW does its best to keep agents on a leash, but at the end of the day you are trusting software written by an AI, managed by an AI, and verified by a different AI. If this arrangement doesn't concern you, you are exactly the target audience for this plugin.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## How It Works\n\nVBW operates on a simple loop that will feel familiar to anyone who's ever shipped software. Or read about it on Reddit.\n\n```\n                        ┌─────────────────────────────┐\n                        │  YOU HAVE AN IDEA           │\n                        │  (dangerous, but continue)  │\n                        └──────────────┬──────────────┘\n                                       │\n                        ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐\n                        │ Greenfield?   │  Brownfield? │\n                        └──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┘\n                               │              │\n                  ┌────────────┘              └────────────┐\n                  │                                        │\n                  ▼                                        ▼\n     ┌───────────────────────┐               ┌───────────────────────┐\n     │  /vbw:init            │               │  /vbw:init            │\n     │  Environment setup    │               │  Environment setup    │\n     │  Scaffold             │               │  Scaffold             │\n     │  Skills               │               │                       │\n     │                       │               │  ⚠ Codebase detected  │\n     │  Auto-chains:         │               │  Auto-chains:         │\n     │    → /vbw:vibe        │               │    → /vbw:map         │\n     └──────────┬────────────┘               │    → Skills (informed │\n                │                            │      by map data)     │\n                │                            │    → /vbw:vibe        │\n                │                            └──────────┬────────────┘\n                │                                       │\n                └───────────────────┬───────────────────┘\n                                    │\n                                    ▼\n                 ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐\n                 │  /vbw:vibe                           │\n                 │  The one command — auto-detects:     │\n                 │                                      │\n                 │  No project?  → Bootstrap setup      │\n                 │  No phases?   → Scope & plan work    │\n                 │  Unplanned?   → Plan next phase      │\n                 │  Planned?     → Execute next phase   │\n                 │  All done?    → Suggest archive      │\n                 └──────────────────┬───────────────────┘\n                                    │\n                                    │  Or use flags:\n                                    │  /vbw:vibe --discuss\n                                    │  /vbw:vibe --plan --execute\n                                    │\n                                    ▼\n                     ┌──────────────────────────────┐\n                     │  /vbw:qa [phase]             │\n                     │  Three-tier verification     │\n                     │  Goal-backward methodology   │\n                     │  Outputs: VERIFICATION.md    │\n                     └──────────────┬───────────────┘\n                                    │\n                           ┌────────┴────────┐\n                           │  More phases?   │\n                           └────────┬────────┘\n                          yes │          │ no\n                              │          │\n                     ┌────────┘          └────────┐\n                     │                            │\n                     ▼                            ▼\n          ┌──────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐\n          │ Loop back to     │        │ /vbw:vibe        │\n          │ /vbw:vibe        │        │ --archive        │\n          │ for next phase   │        │ Audits, archives │\n          └──────────────────┘        │ Tags the release │\n                                      │ Work archived    │\n                                      └──────────────────┘\n```\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Quick Tutorial\n\nYou only need to remember two commands. Seriously. VBW auto-detects where your project is and does the right thing. No decision trees, no memorizing workflows. Just init, then vibe until it's done.\n\n### Starting a brand new project\n\n```\n/vbw:init\n```\n\nRun this once. VBW sets up your environment — Agent Teams, statusline, git hooks — and scaffolds a `.vbw-planning/` directory. It detects your tech stack and suggests relevant Claude Code skills. You answer a few questions, and you're ready to build.\n\n```\n/vbw:vibe\n```\n\nThis is the one command. Run it, and VBW figures out what to do next:\n\n- **No project defined?** It asks about your project, gathers requirements, and creates a phased roadmap.\n- **Phases ready but not planned?** The Lead agent researches, decomposes, and produces plans.\n- **Plans ready but not built?** Dev teammates execute in parallel with atomic commits and continuous verification.\n- **Everything built?** It tells you and suggests wrapping up.\n\nYou don't need to know which state your project is in. VBW knows. Just keep running `/vbw:vibe` and it handles the rest — planning, building, verifying — one phase at a time. Or if you're feeling brave, set your autonomy to `pure-vibe` and it'll loop through every remaining phase without stopping.\n\n```\n/vbw:vibe\n```\n\nYes, the same command again. When Phase 1 finishes, run it again for Phase 2. And again for Phase 3. Each invocation picks up where the last one left off. State persists in `.vbw-planning/` across sessions, so you can close your terminal, come back tomorrow, and `/vbw:vibe` still knows exactly where you are.\n\n```\n/vbw:vibe --archive\n```\n\nWhen all phases are built, archive the work. VBW runs a completion audit, archives state to `.vbw-planning/milestones/`, tags the git release, and updates project docs. You shipped. With actual verification. Your future self won't want to set the codebase on fire. Probably.\n\n```\n/vbw:release\n```\n\nReady to publish? This runs a pre-release audit first — checking that your changelog covers all commits since the last release and that README counts aren't stale. If anything's missing, it offers to generate entries for your review. Then it bumps the version, finalizes the changelog, creates an annotated git tag, commits, pushes, and creates a GitHub release with the changelog notes. Supports `--dry-run` to preview, `--skip-audit` to bypass the audit, `--major` or `--minor` for non-patch bumps.\n\nThat's it. `init` → `vibe` (repeat) → `vibe --archive` → `release`. Three commands for an entire development lifecycle.\n\n### Picking up an existing codebase\n\nSame flow, one difference:\n\n```\n/vbw:init\n```\n\nVBW detects the existing codebase and auto-chains everything: `/vbw:map` launches 4 Scout teammates to analyze your code across tech stack, architecture, quality, and concerns. Skill suggestions are based on what's actually in your codebase, not just which manifest files exist. Then `/vbw:vibe` runs automatically with full codebase awareness. One command, four workflows, zero manual sequencing.\n\nFrom there, it's the same loop: `/vbw:vibe` until done, `/vbw:vibe --archive`, `/vbw:release`.\n\n### Coming back to a project\n\n```\n/vbw:resume\n```\n\nClosed your terminal? Switched branches? Came back after a weekend of pretending you have hobbies? `/vbw:resume` reads ground truth directly from `.vbw-planning/` -- STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, plans, summaries -- and rebuilds your full project context. No prior `/vbw:pause` needed. It detects interrupted builds, reconciles stale execution state, and tells you exactly what to do next. One command, full situational awareness, zero guessing.\n\n> **⚠️ Do not use `/clear`.**\n>\n> Opus 4.6 auto-compacts your context window when it fills up. It intelligently summarizes older conversation turns while preserving critical state — active plan tasks, file paths, commit history, deviation decisions, error context — so the session continues seamlessly with full project awareness. VBW enhances this further with `PreCompact` hooks and post-compaction verification that inject agent-specific preservation priorities and verify nothing critical was lost.\n>\n> `/clear` bypasses all of this. It destroys your entire context — every file read, every decision made, every task in progress — and drops you into a blank session with no memory of what just happened. Auto-compaction is surgical; `/clear` is a sledgehammer.\n>\n> **If you accidentally `/clear`**, run `/vbw:resume` immediately. It restores project context from ground truth files in `.vbw-planning/` — state, roadmap, plans, summaries — and tells you exactly where to pick up.\n\n> **For advanced users:** The [full command reference](#commands) below has 21 commands for granular control — `/vbw:vibe` with flags for explicit mode selection (`--plan`, `--execute`, `--discuss`, `--assumptions`), `/vbw:qa` for on-demand verification, `/vbw:debug` for systematic bug investigation, and more. But you never *need* the flags. `/vbw:vibe` with no arguments handles the entire lifecycle on its own.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Commands\n\n### Lifecycle -- The Main Loop\n\nThese are the commands you'll use every day. This is the job now.\n\n| Command | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `/vbw:init` | Set up environment and scaffold `.vbw-planning/` directory with templates and config. Configures Agent Teams and statusline. Automatically installs git hooks (pre-push version enforcement). For existing codebases, maps the codebase first, then uses the map data to inform stack detection and skill suggestions before auto-chaining to `/vbw:vibe`. |\n| `/vbw:vibe [intent or flags]` | The one command. Auto-detects project state, parses natural language intent, or accepts explicit flags. 11 modes: bootstrap, scope, discuss, assumptions, plan, execute, add/insert/remove phase, archive. Flags: `--plan`, `--execute`, `--discuss`, `--assumptions`, `--scope`, `--add`, `--insert`, `--remove`, `--archive`, `--yolo`, `--effort`, `--skip-qa`, `--skip-audit`. Phase numbers optional -- auto-detected when omitted. |\n| `/vbw:release` | Bump version, finalize changelog, tag, commit, push, and create a GitHub release. Runs a pre-release audit that checks changelog completeness against commits since last release and detects stale README counts, offering to fix issues before shipping. Runs `bump-version.sh` across all 4 version files, renames `[Unreleased]` to the new version in CHANGELOG.md, creates an annotated git tag, pushes, and creates a GitHub release with changelog notes via `gh`. Supports `--dry-run`, `--no-push`, `--major`, `--minor`, `--skip-audit`. |\n\n<br>\n\n### Monitoring -- Trust But Verify\n\n| Command | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `/vbw:status` | Progress dashboard showing all phases, completion bars, velocity metrics, and suggested next action. Add `--metrics` for token consumption breakdown per agent. |\n| `/vbw:qa [phase]` | Deep verification on demand. Three tiers (Quick, Standard, Deep) with goal-backward methodology. Continuous QA runs automatically via hooks during builds -- this command is for thorough, on-demand verification. Produces VERIFICATION.md. Phase is auto-detected when omitted. |\n\n<br>\n\n### Supporting -- The Safety Net\n\n| Command | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `/vbw:fix` | Quick task in Turbo mode. One commit, no ceremony. For when the fix is obvious and you don't need six agents to add a missing comma. |\n| `/vbw:debug` | Systematic bug investigation via the Debugger agent. At Thorough effort with ambiguous bugs, spawns 3 parallel debugger teammates for competing hypothesis investigation. Hypothesis, evidence, root cause, fix. Like the scientific method, except it actually finds things. |\n| `/vbw:todo` | Add an item to a persistent backlog that survives across sessions. For all those \"we should really...\" thoughts that usually die in a terminal tab. |\n| `/vbw:pause` | Save session notes for next time. State auto-persists in `.vbw-planning/` -- pause just lets you leave a sticky note for future you. |\n| `/vbw:resume` | Restore project context from `.vbw-planning/` ground truth. Reads state, roadmap, plans, and summaries directly -- no prior `/vbw:pause` needed. |\n| `/vbw:skills` | Browse and install community skills from skills.sh based on your project's tech stack. Detects your stack, suggests relevant skills, and installs them with one command. |\n| `/vbw:config` | View and toggle VBW settings: effort profiles, autonomy levels (cautious/standard/confident/pure-vibe), plain-language summaries (`plain_summary`), skill suggestions, auto-install behavior, and skill-hook wiring. Detects profile drift and offers to save as new profile. |\n| `/vbw:profile` | Switch between work profiles or create custom ones. 4 built-in presets (default, prototype, production, yolo) change effort, autonomy, and verification in one command. Interactive profile creation for custom workflows. |\n| `/vbw:teach` | View, add, or manage project conventions. Auto-detected from codebase during init, manually teachable anytime. Shows what VBW already knows and warns about conflicts before adding. Conventions are injected into agent context via CLAUDE.md and verified by QA. |\n| `/vbw:doctor` | Run 10 health checks on your VBW installation: jq, VERSION sync, plugin cache, hooks validity, agent files, config, script permissions, gh CLI, sort -V support. Diagnoses issues before they become mysteries. |\n| `/vbw:help` | Command reference with usage examples. You are reading its output's spiritual ancestor right now. |\n\n<br>\n\n### Advanced -- For When You're Feeling Ambitious\n\n| Command | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `/vbw:map` | Analyze a codebase with 4 parallel Scout teammates (Tech, Architecture, Quality, Concerns). Produces synthesis documents (INDEX.md, PATTERNS.md). Supports monorepo per-package mapping. Security-enforced via hooks: never reads `.env` or credentials. |\n| `/vbw:research` | Standalone research task, decoupled from planning. For when you need answers but aren't ready to commit to a plan. |\n| `/vbw:whats-new` | View changelog entries since your installed version. |\n| `/vbw:update` | Update VBW to the latest version with automatic cache refresh. |\n| `/vbw:uninstall` | Clean removal of VBW -- statusline, settings, and project data. For when you want to go back to prompting manually like it's 2024. |\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## The Agents\n\nVBW uses 6 specialized agents, each with native tool permissions enforced via YAML frontmatter. Three layers of control -- `tools` (what they can use), `disallowedTools` (what's platform-denied), and `permissionMode` (how they interact with the session) -- mean they can't do what they shouldn't, which is more than can be said for most interns.\n\n| Agent | Role | Tools | Denied | Mode |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Scout** | Research and information gathering. The responsible one. | Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch | Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, Bash | `plan` |\n| **Architect** | Creates roadmaps and phase structure. Writes plans, not code. | Read, Glob, Grep, Write | Edit, WebFetch, Bash | `acceptEdits` |\n| **Lead** | Merges research + planning + self-review. The one who actually makes decisions. | Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash, WebFetch | Edit | `acceptEdits` |\n| **Dev** | Writes code, makes commits, builds things. Handle with care. | Full access | -- | `acceptEdits` |\n| **QA** | Goal-backward verification. Trusts nothing.

Most of yours don't. VBW provides four effort profiles that control how much your agents think before they act.\n\n| Profile | What It Does | When To Use It |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Thorough** | Maximum agent depth. Full Lead planning, deep QA, comprehensive research. Dev teammates require plan approval before writing code. Competing hypothesis debugging for ambiguous bugs. | Architecture decisions. Things that would be embarrassing to get wrong. |\n| **Balanced** | Standard depth. Good planning, solid QA. The default. | Most work. The sweet spot between quality and not burning your API budget. |\n| **Fast** | Lighter planning, quicker verification. | Straightforward phases where the path is obvious. |\n| **Turbo** | Single Dev agent, no Lead or QA. Just builds. | Trivial changes. Adding a config value. Fixing a typo. Things that don't need a committee. |\n\n```\n/vbw:vibe --plan 3 --effort=turbo\n/vbw:vibe --effort=thorough\n```\n\nOr switch effort, autonomy, and verification together with `/vbw:profile`:\n\n```\n/vbw:profile prototype    → fast + confident + quick\n/vbw:profile production   → thorough + cautious + deep\n/vbw:profile yolo         → turbo + pure-vibe + skip\n```\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Autonomy Levels\n\nEffort controls how hard your agents think. Autonomy controls how often they stop to ask you about it.\n\nFour levels, from \"review everything\" to \"just build the whole thing while I get coffee\":\n\n| Level | What It Does | When To Use It |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Cautious** | Stops between plan and execute. Plan approval at Thorough AND Balanced effort. All confirmations enforced. | First time on a codebase. Production-critical work. When you want to review every step before it happens. |\n| **Standard** | Auto-chains plan into execute within a phase. Plan approval at Thorough only. Stops between phases. The default. | Most work. You trust the plan but want to see results before continuing. |\n| **Confident** | Skips \"already complete\" confirmations. Plan approval OFF even at Thorough. QA warnings non-blocking. | Experienced with VBW, rebuilding known-good phases, iteration speed matters more than gate checks. |\n| **Pure Vibe** | Loops ALL remaining phases in a single `/vbw:vibe`. No confirmations. No plan approval. Only error guards (missing roadmap, uninitialized project) stop execution. | When you want to walk away and come back to a finished project. Full autonomy with VBW's safety nets still active. |\n\n```\n/vbw:config autonomy confident\n/vbw:config autonomy pure-vibe\n```\n\nAutonomy interacts with effort profiles. At `cautious`, plan approval expands to cover Balanced effort (not just Thorough). At `confident` and `pure-vibe`, plan approval is disabled regardless of effort level. Error guards — missing roadmap, uninitialized project, missing plans — always halt at every level. Autonomy controls friction, not safety.\n\n| Gate | Cautious | Standard | Confident | Pure Vibe |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Plan to execute | Stop and ask | Auto-chain | Auto-chain | Auto-chain |\n| Between phases | Stop | Stop | Stop | Auto-loop |\n| \"Already complete\" warning | Confirm | Confirm | Skip | Skip |\n| Plan approval (Thorough) | Required | Required | Off | Off |\n| Plan approval (Balanced) | Required | Off | Off | Off |\n\n<br>\n\n## Cost Optimization\n\nVBW spawns specialized agents for planning, development, and verification. Model profiles let you control which Claude model each agent uses, trading cost for quality based on your needs.\n\n### Three Preset Profiles\n\n| Profile | Use Case | Lead | Dev | QA | Scout | Est. Cost/Phase |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |\n| **Quality** | Production work, architecture decisions (default) | opus | opus | sonnet | haiku | ~$2.80 |\n| **Balanced** | Standard development | sonnet | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | ~$1.40 |\n| **Budget** | Prototyping, tight budgets | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | haiku | ~$0.70 |\n\n*Debugger and Architect follow the same model as Lead. Estimates based on typical 3-plan phase.*\n\n**Quality is the default.** It gives you maximum reasoning depth for architecture decisions and production-critical work. Switch to Balanced (`/vbw:config model_profile balanced`) for 50% cost savings on standard development.\n\n**Quality** uses Opus for Lead, Dev, Debugger, and Architect -- maximum reasoning depth for critical work. QA stays on Sonnet (verification doesn't need Opus), Scout on Haiku (research throughput).\n\n**Budget** keeps Dev and core agents on Sonnet (quality baseline) but drops QA to Haiku. Good for exploratory work where you're iterating fast and verification can be lighter.\n\n### Switching Profiles\n\n```bash\n/vbw:config model_profile quality\n/vbw:config model_profile balanced\n/vbw:config model_profile budget\n```\n\nEach switch shows before/after cost impact. Changes apply to the next phase.\n\n### Per-Agent Overrides\n\nNeed Opus for one agent without switching the whole profile?\n\n```bash\n/vbw:config model_override dev opus\n/vbw:config model_override qa sonnet\n```\n\nCommon patterns:\n- Budget profile + Dev override to Opus for complex implementation tasks\n- Balanced profile + Lead override to Opus for strategic planning phases\n- Quality profile + QA override to Haiku when verification is straightforward\n\n### Effort vs Model\n\n**Model profile** controls which Claude model agents use (cost).\n**Effort** controls how deeply agents think (workflow depth).\n\nThey're independent. You can run Thorough effort on Budget profile (deep workflow, cheap models) or Fast effort on Quality profile (quick workflow, expensive models). Most users match them:\n- `thorough` effort + `quality` profile\n- `balanced` effort + `balanced` profile\n- `fast` effort + `budget` profile\n\nSwitch both at once with work profiles:\n\n```bash\n/vbw:profile production   → thorough + quality\n/vbw:profile prototype    → fast + budget\n```\n\nSee **[Model Profiles Reference](references/model-profiles.md)** for preset definitions, cost breakdown, and implementation details.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## What You Get Versus Raw Claude Code\n\nFor the \"I'll just prompt carefully\" crowd.\n\n| Without VBW | With VBW |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| One long session, no structure | Phased roadmap with requirements traceability |\n| Manual agent spawning | 6 specialized agents with enforced permissions |\n| Hope the AI remembers context | Persistent state across sessions via `.vbw-planning/` |\n| No verification unless you ask | Continuous QA via 21 hooks + deep verification on demand |\n| Commits whenever, whatever | Atomic commits per task with validation |\n| \"It works on my machine\" | Goal-backward verification against success criteria |\n| Agents talk in free-form text | Structured JSON handoff schemas between agents |\n| Skills exist somewhere | Stack-aware skill discovery and auto-suggestion |\n| Generic \"what now?\" after every command | Context-aware next-action suggestions with plan IDs, phase names, staleness % |\n| Technical output only | Plain-language \"What happened\" summary after builds (toggleable) |\n| Implicit cross-phase dependencies | Explicit `cross_phase_deps` in plans, validated before execution |\n| Raw agent names in cost tracking | Workflow categories (Build/Plan/Verify) with efficiency insights |\n| Hook failure blocks your session | Universal hook wrapper -- errors logged, session always continues |\n| Install plugin, stare at blank screen | Branded welcome with single call to action on first run |\n| Memorize flags for each command | Consistent argument hints on all 21 commands with discoverable flags |\n| Change 3-4 settings to switch work mode | Work profiles: one command to switch between prototype, production, and yolo modes |\n| Conventions live as free text in CLAUDE.md | Structured conventions auto-detected from codebase, conflict-checked, QA-verified |\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n.claude-plugin/    Plugin manifest (plugin.json)\nagents/            6 agent definitions with native tool permissions\ncommands/          21 slash commands (commands/*.md)\nconfig/            Default settings and stack-to-skill mappings\nhooks/             Plugin hooks for continuous verification\nscripts/           Hook handler scripts (security, validation, QA gates)\nreferences/        Brand vocabulary, verification protocol, effort profiles, handoff schemas\ntemplates/         Artifact templates (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, etc.)\nassets/            Images and static files\n```\n\n<br>\n\nWhen you run `/vbw:init` in your project, it creates:\n\n```\n.vbw-planning/\n  PROJECT.md       Project definition, core value, requirements, decisions\n  REQUIREMENTS.md  Versioned requirements with traceability\n  ROADMAP.md       Phases, plans, success criteria, progress tracking\n  STATE.md         Current position, velocity metrics, session continuity\n  config.json      Local VBW configuration\n  phases/          Execution artifacts (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md per phase)\n  milestones/      Archived milestone records\n```\n\nYour AI-managed project now has more structure than most startups that raised a Series A.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Claude Code** with **Opus 4.6+** model\n- **jq** -- the only external dependency. Install via `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux). VBW checks for jq during `/vbw:init` and session start, and warns clearly if it's missing.\n- **Agent Teams** enabled (`/vbw:init` will offer to set this up for you)\n- A project directory (new or existing)\n- The willingness to let an AI manage your development lifecycle\n\nThat last one is the real barrier to entry.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on local development, project structure, and pull requests.\n\n<br>\n\n## License\n\nMIT -- see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\nBuilt by [Tiago Serôdio](https://github.com/yidakee).\n"
