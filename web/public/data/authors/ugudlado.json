        "plugin/README.md": "# local-review\n\nGitHub-style local code review plugin for Claude Code. Review diffs in a browser UI, add inline threaded comments, then let Claude resolve them — replying to questions, applying fixes when clear, or asking for clarification when not.\n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\n# Start the review UI\npnpm dev   # from repo root — starts Vite at http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Open the UI** — `/review-open`\n   Browse diffs, click `+` on lines to comment, drag for multi-line threads.\n\n2. **Save the session** — click \"Save Session\" in the UI\n   Persists threads to `.review/sessions/*.json`\n\n3. **Let Claude resolve** — `/review-resolve`\n   Claude reads every open thread, replies with analysis, applies code fixes where unambiguous, and asks questions when context is missing.\n\n4. **Refresh the UI** — see Claude's replies inline\n\n5. **Target a single thread** — `/review-reply <thread-id>`\n   Focus Claude on one specific comment.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/review-open [session-file]` | Open the UI and optionally load a session |\n| `/review-resolve [session-file]` | Resolve all open threads in the latest (or specified) session |\n| `/review-reply <thread-id> [session-file]` | Reply to a specific thread by ID |\n\n## Agent\n\n**review-resolver** (magenta) — reads a thread + its code context and decides:\n- Apply a fix → when issue is clear and solution is unambiguous\n- Reply with explanation → when the comment asks \"why\"\n- Ask a clarifying question → when context is missing or multiple valid approaches exist\n\n## Session Storage\n\nSessions are saved to `.review/sessions/` as JSON files. They contain the full diff, all threads, and messages from both humans and Claude (marked with `authorType: \"agent\"`).\n"
