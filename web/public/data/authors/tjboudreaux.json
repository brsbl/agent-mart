away assumptions to reveal fundamental truths, then rebuild solutions from basics. Championed by Elon Musk and rooted in Aristotle's philosophy.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Conventional approaches have failed\n- You're told something is \"impossible\"\n- Need innovation, not incremental improvement\n\n### Bayesian Reasoning\nUpdate beliefs systematically based on new evidence. Provides a framework for thinking about probability and uncertainty.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Estimating probabilities or likelihoods\n- Interpreting test results or metrics\n- Making decisions with incomplete information\n\n### Systems Thinking\nView problems as part of interconnected wholes with feedback loops and emergent properties. Essential for debugging complex distributed systems.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Debugging spans multiple components\n- Fix in one place breaks another\n- Behavior seems emergent or unexpected\n\n### Theory of Constraints\nEvery system has exactly one constraint limiting throughput. Optimizing anything else is wasted effort. Based on Eliyahu Goldratt's work.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Performance optimization\n- Process improvement\n- Resource allocation\n- Identifying bottlenecks\n\n### Cynefin Framework\nClassify problems by the relationship between cause and effect: Clear, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic. Each domain requires a different approach.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Choosing methodologies\n- Understanding why approaches fail\n- Crisis management\n\n### Jobs to Be Done\nCustomers don't buy products—they hire them to do jobs. Understanding the job unlocks innovation.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Product development\n- Feature prioritization\n- Understanding customer behavior\n\n### Red Team Thinking\nAttack your own plans before adversaries do. The best defense is knowing your weaknesses.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Security review\n- Pre-launch preparation\n- Plan stress-testing\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.\n\n### Adding New Skills\n\n1. Create a new directory under `skills/` with the format `thinking-{name}`\n2.

Add process timeline to create urgency\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Agents\n\nFive specialized agents, each with structured thinking frameworks woven into their analysis.\n\n| Agent | Model | Purpose | Thinking Enhancements |\n|-------|-------|---------|----------------------|\n| **pitch-analyst** | Opus | Evaluates pitches across 11 scored dimensions with specific rewrites | First principles, red-team, inversion, steel-manning |\n| **narrative-architect** | Opus | Constructs complete pitch narratives following Sequoia's arc | First principles, systems thinking, JTBD, feedback loops |\n| **qa-coach** | Opus | Prepares founders for the 35 toughest VC questions | Red-team, inversion, pre-mortem, bayesian updating |\n| **fundraise-strategist** | Sonnet | Plans end-to-end process from prep through close | Systems, theory of constraints, OODA, regret minimization |\n| **investor-update-writer** | Sonnet | Drafts investor communications that build trust and momentum | Feedback loops, inversion, systems, second-order effects |\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What the pitch-analyst evaluates</strong></summary>\n\nEvery pitch is scored 1-5 across 11 dimensions:\n\n1. **Narrative Coherence** -- Can it be retold in 30 seconds?\n2. **Earned Secret Strength** -- Is the insight genuinely non-consensus and earned?\n3. **\"Why Now\" Conviction** -- Is there a concrete inflection point?\n4. **Value Hypothesis** -- Are there desperate customers with organic pull?\n5. **Customer as Hero** -- Is the customer transformed, not just served?\n6. **Market Size Credibility** -- Bottom-up + top-down, avoiding \"1% of China\"\n7. **Clarity & Precision** -- Numbers replace adjectives, plain language throughout\n8. **Traction Storytelling** -- MoM context, cohorts, qualitative + quantitative\n9. **Internal Championing** -- Does it arm a VC partner for their IC meeting?\n10. **Conviction & Urgency** -- Does it build belief AND a reason to act now?\n11. **Stage Appropriateness** -- Does the narrative match Pre-Seed through Growth?\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What the qa-coach covers</strong></summary>\n\n35 tough VC questions across 7 categories, with the Acknowledge-Bridge-Message (ABM) framework:\n\n- **Market & Problem** -- \"Why hasn't someone else built this?\" \"Is this a feature or a company?\"\n- **Product & Traction** -- \"How do you know you have PMF?\" \"Your growth seems to have flattened.\"\n- **Team & Execution** -- \"Why are you the team to build this?\" \"Tell me about a time you were wrong.\"\n- **Business Model** -- \"Your burn seems high relative to revenue.\" \"Why this valuation?\"\n- **Competition** -- \"What's your moat?\" \"How defensible is this in 5 years?\"\n- **Strategy & Vision** -- \"What's the biggest risk?\" \"What does this look like in 10 years?\"\n- **Conviction & Process** -- \"Why will this be a $10B company?\" \"Who else are you talking to?\"\n\nEach response is red-teamed from the VC's perspective before finalizing.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\nTwo domain skills that auto-activate based on conversation context.\n\n| Skill | Auto-Activates When You Mention |\n|-------|-------------------------------|\n| **fundraising-narrative** | pitch deck, fundraising story, VC narrative, earned secret, why now, TAM/SAM/SOM, value hypothesis, product-market fit |\n| **investor-relations** | investor update, board deck, monthly update, crisis communication, warm intro, VC relationship, fundraising timeline |\n\n---\n\n## The 10 First Principles\n\nThe entire toolkit is grounded in these principles, synthesized from Sequoia, a16z, Benchmark, Floodgate, NFX, and YC. See [`FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md`](FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md) for the complete framework with quotes, examples, and stage-specific guidance.\n\n| # | Principle | Core Idea |\n|---|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 | **Story IS Strategy** | The narrative is the business case. If a VC can't retell it in 30 seconds, you won't get funded. |\n| 2 | **Lead with the Earned Secret** | A non-obvious insight earned through direct experience -- not read in a report. |\n| 3 | **\"Why Now\" Is the Linchpin** | A specific, concrete inflection point -- not \"the world is ready.\" |\n| 4 | **Prove Value Before Growth** | Show desperate customers before discussing scaling plans. |\n| 5 | **The Customer Is the Hero** | You're the mentor (Gandalf, Obi-Wan), not the protagonist. |\n| 6 | **Market Size: Ambitious + Defensible** | Bottom-up credibility combined with top-down ambition. |\n| 7 | **Clarity Over Polish** | Slide headings alone should tell the complete story. |\n| 8 | **Numbers in Every Sentence** | Replace every vague claim with a specific metric. |\n| 9 | **Design for Internal Championing** | Optimize for the IC meeting you don't attend. |\n| 10 | **Fundraising Is Continuous** | Lines, not dots. Monthly updates create the trajectory investors extrapolate from. |\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How narratives evolve by fundraising stage</strong></summary>\n\n| Stage | Core Question | Narrative Focus | Key Evidence |\n|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Pre-Seed** | \"Is this worth exploring?\" | Earned secret + inflection point | Founder-market fit, prototype |\n| **Seed** | \"Does this idea work?\" | Problem severity + unique insight | Early users, qualitative signals |\n| **Series A** | \"Does this business work?\" | Product-market fit + unit economics | 6+ months of 10%+ MoM growth |\n| **Series B** | \"How big can this get?\" | Scalable operations + category leadership | Proven unit economics, expansion |\n| **Growth** | \"Will this be the winner?\" | Market dominance + operational excellence | Revenue scale, competitive moats |\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Thinking Skills Integration\n\nEach agent integrates structured thinking frameworks from the companion [cc-thinking-skills](https://github.com/tjboudreaux/cc-thinking-skills) plugin. 15 frameworks are mapped across 5 agents with domain-specific prompts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Primary Lenses (always applied)\"\n        PA[pitch-analyst] -->|decomposes| FP[First Principles]\n        PA -->|attacks| RT[Red Team]\n        NA[narrative-architect] -->|maps ecosystem| ST[Systems Thinking]\n        NA -->|decomposes| FP\n        QC[qa-coach] -->|attacks answers| RT\n        QC -->|finds failure modes| INV[Inversion]\n        FS[fundraise-strategist] -->|maps relationships| ST\n        FS -->|rapid decisions| OODA[OODA Loops]\n        IU[investor-update-writer] -->|narrates drivers| FL[Feedback Loops]\n        IU -->|frames challenges| INV\n    end\n```\n\n**How it works:** Each agent has two tiers of integration:\n\n- **Primary lenses** (1-2 per agent) -- Woven into existing process steps. Always applied. The pitch-analyst always decomposes earned secrets to first principles and red-teams the overall pitch.\n\n- **Thinking Toolkit** (2-6 per agent) -- Situational frameworks with VC-specific prompts. The agent selects based on context. For example, the fundraise-strategist applies theory of constraints when diagnosing why a raise is stalling, or regret minimization when evaluating competing term sheets.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Full integration matrix</strong></summary>\n\n```\nFramework                 pitch-  narrative-  qa-     fundraise-  investor-\n                          analyst architect   coach   strategist  update-writer\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nfirst-principles          PRIMARY PRIMARY     ·       ·           ·\nred-team                  PRIMARY ·           PRIMARY ·           ·\ninversion                 toolkit ·           PRIMARY ·           PRIMARY\nsystems                   ·       PRIMARY     ·       PRIMARY     toolkit\nsecond-order              ·       PRIMARY     ·       toolkit     toolkit\nfeedback-loops            ·       toolkit     ·       toolkit     PRIMARY\nooda                      ·       ·           ·       PRIMARY     ·\nsteel-manning             toolkit ·           toolkit ·           ·\nmap-territory             toolkit ·           ·       ·           ·\njobs-to-be-done           ·       toolkit     ·       ·           ·\nleverage-points           ·       toolkit     ·       ·           ·\npre-mortem                ·       ·           toolkit toolkit     ·\nbayesian                  ·       ·           toolkit ·           ·\ntheory-of-constraints     ·       ·           ·       toolkit     ·\nregret-minimization       ·       ·           ·       toolkit     ·\n```\n\n**PRIMARY** = always applied &nbsp;&nbsp; **toolkit** = applied situationally\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Architecture\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"User-Facing Commands\"\n        PR[\"/pitch-review\"]\n        BN[\"/build-narrative\"]\n        QP[\"/qa-prep\"]\n        FP[\"/fundraise-plan\"]\n        IU[\"/investor-update\"]\n        BD[\"/board-deck\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Specialized Agents\"\n        PA[\"pitch-analyst (Opus)\"]\n        NA[\"narrative-architect (Opus)\"]\n        QC[\"qa-coach (Opus)\"]\n        FS[\"fundraise-strategist (Sonnet)\"]\n        IW[\"investor-update-writer (Sonnet)\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Knowledge Base\"\n        FPR[\"FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md\"]\n        FN[\"fundraising-narrative skill\"]\n        IR[\"investor-relations skill\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Thinking Frameworks\"\n        TS[\"cc-thinking-skills plugin (15 frameworks)\"]\n    end\n\n    PR --> PA\n    BN --> NA\n    QP --> QC\n    FP --> FS\n    IU --> IW\n    BD --> IW\n\n    PA --> FPR\n    NA --> FPR\n    QC --> FPR\n    FS --> FPR\n    IW --> FPR\n\n    PA -.-> TS\n    NA -.-> TS\n    QC -.-> TS\n    FS -.-> TS\n    IW -.-> TS\n\n    FN --> FPR\n    IR --> FPR\n```\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This plugin works fully standalone.
