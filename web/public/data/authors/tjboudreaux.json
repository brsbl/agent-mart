away assumptions to reveal fundamental truths, then rebuild solutions from basics. Championed by Elon Musk and rooted in Aristotle's philosophy.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Conventional approaches have failed\n- You're told something is \"impossible\"\n- Need innovation, not incremental improvement\n\n### Bayesian Reasoning\nUpdate beliefs systematically based on new evidence. Provides a framework for thinking about probability and uncertainty.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Estimating probabilities or likelihoods\n- Interpreting test results or metrics\n- Making decisions with incomplete information\n\n### Systems Thinking\nView problems as part of interconnected wholes with feedback loops and emergent properties. Essential for debugging complex distributed systems.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Debugging spans multiple components\n- Fix in one place breaks another\n- Behavior seems emergent or unexpected\n\n### Theory of Constraints\nEvery system has exactly one constraint limiting throughput. Optimizing anything else is wasted effort. Based on Eliyahu Goldratt's work.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Performance optimization\n- Process improvement\n- Resource allocation\n- Identifying bottlenecks\n\n### Cynefin Framework\nClassify problems by the relationship between cause and effect: Clear, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic. Each domain requires a different approach.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Choosing methodologies\n- Understanding why approaches fail\n- Crisis management\n\n### Jobs to Be Done\nCustomers don't buy products—they hire them to do jobs. Understanding the job unlocks innovation.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Product development\n- Feature prioritization\n- Understanding customer behavior\n\n### Red Team Thinking\nAttack your own plans before adversaries do. The best defense is knowing your weaknesses.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Security review\n- Pre-launch preparation\n- Plan stress-testing\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.\n\n### Adding New Skills\n\n1. Create a new directory under `skills/` with the format `thinking-{name}`\n2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:\n```yaml\n---\nname: thinking-your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description under 200 chars (used by Claude Code for skill matching)\n---\n```\n3. Write comprehensive documentation with:\n   - Overview and core principle\n   - When to use decision flow\n   - Step-by-step process\n   - At least 2 practical examples\n   - Reusable template\n   - Verification checklist\n   - Key questions\n\n4. Validate your skill:\n```bash\nnode scripts/validate-skills.js\n```\n\n## Keywords\n\n`claude-code` `claude` `anthropic` `ai` `skills` `mental-models` `critical-thinking` `decision-making` `problem-solving` `systems-thinking` `first-principles` `bayesian-reasoning` `cognitive-bias` `strategic-thinking` `frameworks` `triz` `ooda` `pre-mortem` `socratic-method` `theory-of-constraints` `cynefin` `jobs-to-be-done` `red-team` `fermi-estimation`\n\n## Related Resources\n\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)\n- [Charlie Munger's Mental Models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)\n- [Thinking in Systems - Donella Meadows](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/)\n- [Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)\n- [The Goal - Eliyahu Goldratt](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\n## Author\n\nCreated by [TJ Boudreaux](https://github.com/tjboudreaux)\n\n---\n\n**Found this useful?** Give it a star and share with others who could benefit from better thinking frameworks in Claude Code.\n"
