        "README.md": "# Claude Code Plugins Marketplace\n\nA curated marketplace of powerful plugins to enhance your Claude Code experience.\n\n## What is This?\n\nThis is a plugin marketplace for Claude Code that provides centralized access to high-quality plugins. Marketplaces allow you to easily discover, install, and manage Claude Code extensions from a single source.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### Software Engineer Plugin\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Author:** Lorenzo Dessimoni\n\nA comprehensive Software Engineer plugin for Claude Code that enhances development workflows with specialized tools and capabilities.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code installed on your system\n- Git (for cloning from GitHub)\n\n### Quick Start\n\nAdd this marketplace to your Claude Code installation using one of the following methods:\n\n#### Option 1: From GitHub (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins\n```\n\n#### Option 2: From Git URL\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins.git\n```\n\n#### Option 3: From Local Path\n\nIf you've cloned this repository locally:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/funkyoz-plugins\n```\n\nOr directly reference the marketplace file:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/funkyoz-plugins/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nList all your configured marketplaces:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace list\n```\n\nYou should see `funkyoz-plugins` in the list.\n\n## Installing Plugins\n\nOnce you've added the marketplace, you can install plugins in two ways:\n\n### Interactive Installation\n\nBrowse and install plugins interactively:\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nThis will show you all available plugins from all your marketplaces. Select the one you want to install.\n\n### Direct Installation\n\nInstall a specific plugin by name:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install software-engineer@funkyoz-plugins\n```\n\nThe format is: `/plugin install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>`\n\n## Updating Marketplace and Plugins\n\n### Why Update?\n\nPlugin marketplaces and their plugins receive regular updates that include:\n- New features and capabilities\n- Bug fixes and performance improvements\n- Security patches\n- New plugins added to the marketplace\n\nIt's recommended to periodically check for updates to ensure you have the latest versions.\n\n### Update Marketplace Metadata\n\nWhen the marketplace adds new plugins or updates plugin information, refresh the marketplace catalog:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update funkyoz-plugins\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Fetches the latest [marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) file from the repository\n- Updates the list of available plugins\n- Refreshes plugin versions and descriptions\n- Does **not** automatically update installed plugins\n\n### Update Individual Plugins\n\nAfter updating the marketplace metadata, you'll see if newer plugin versions are available. To update a specific plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin update software-engineer\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Check if a newer version is available in the marketplace\n- Download and install the latest version\n- Preserve your existing plugin configuration\n\n### Update All Plugins\n\nTo update all installed plugins from all marketplaces at once:\n\n```bash\n/plugin update --all\n```\n\n### Check for Available Updates\n\nTo see which plugins have updates available without installing them:\n\n```bash\n/plugin list\n```\n\nThis will show all installed plugins with their current versions. Compare these with the marketplace listing to identify outdated plugins.\n\n### Update Workflow (Recommended)\n\nFollow this workflow to stay current:\n\n1. **Update marketplace metadata** (monthly or when you know updates are available):\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace update funkyoz-plugins\n   ```\n\n2. **Check what's new**:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin\n   ```\n   Browse the marketplace to see new or updated plugins\n\n3. **Update installed plugins**:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin update software-engineer\n   ```\n   Or update all at once:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin update --all\n   ```\n\n### Version Management\n\nThe marketplace tracks plugin versions in the [marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) file. When you update:\n\n- **Marketplace updates** pull the latest metadata from the git repository\n- **Plugin updates** download the latest plugin code from their respective sources\n- Updates are **non-breaking** - your configurations are preserved\n\n### Auto-Update for Teams\n\nIf your team uses the marketplace configuration in `.claude/settings.json`, team members can stay synchronized:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"github\",\n      \"repo\": \"funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen users run `/plugin marketplace update funkyoz-plugins`, they'll get the same marketplace version as the rest of the team.\n\n## Managing the Marketplace\n\n### List All Marketplaces\n\nSee all configured marketplaces:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace list\n```\n\n### Remove Marketplace\n\nIf you need to remove this marketplace and all its installed plugins:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace remove funkyoz-plugins\n```\n\n**Warning:** This will also uninstall any plugins installed from this marketplace.\n\n## Team Configuration\n\nIf you're using this marketplace in a team setting, you can configure it to be automatically installed for all team members.\n\nAdd this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"github\",\n      \"repo\": \"funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen team members trust the repository, Claude Code will automatically install this marketplace and any specified plugins.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Marketplace Not Found\n\nIf you get an error when adding the marketplace:\n\n1. **Check your internet connection** - Ensure you can access GitHub\n2. **Verify the repository exists** - Visit [https://github.com/funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins](https://github.com/funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins)\n3. **Check for typos** - Make sure you've entered the correct owner/repo name\n\n### Plugin Installation Fails\n\n1. **Update the marketplace** first:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace update funkyoz-plugins\n   ```\n\n2. **Check plugin availability**:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin\n   ```\n   Browse to see if the plugin appears in the list\n\n3. **Check for permissions** - If using a private repository, ensure you have access\n\n### Update Issues\n\nIf marketplace or plugin updates fail:\n\n1. **Check git access** - Ensure you can pull from the repository\n2. **Verify network connectivity** - Updates require internet access\n3. **Check for local modifications** - If you've modified plugins locally, updates may conflict\n4. **Remove and reinstall** - As a last resort:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace remove funkyoz-plugins\n   /plugin marketplace add funkyoz/funkyoz-plugins\n   ```\n\n### Validation Errors\n\nIf you're developing or modifying plugins locally, validate them before sharing:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin validate .\n```\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, questions, or contributions:\n\n- **Email:** lorenzo.dessimoni@gmail.com\n- **Issues:** Report problems via the repository's issue tracker\n\n## Plugin Development\n\nWant to contribute a plugin to this marketplace? Check out the [Claude Code Plugin Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for detailed information on creating and submitting plugins.\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to individual plugin licenses for usage terms and conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Marketplace Maintainer:** Lorenzo Dessimoni (lorenzo.dessimoni@gmail.com)\n",
