This briefcase, and this haircut.\"\n> — Frank Grimes\n\nA pessimistic iteration loop for systematically destroying, rebuilding, and hardening ideas. Named after Frank Grimes (\"Grimey\") from The Simpsons - the only character who actually *analyzed* what was wrong and refused to let it slide.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Everything is crap until proven otherwise.**\n\nThe Grimes Grind assumes your idea, code, plan, or design is:\n- LLM slop\n- Unreliable\n- Insecure\n- Poorly planned\n- Not production-ready\n- Unmaintainable\n\nYour job is to prove these assumptions WRONG, not to prove the idea right.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository and copy the plugin to your plugins directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/misfitdev/claude-plugins.git\ncp -r claude-plugins/plugins/frank-grimes ~/.claude/plugins/\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/frank-grimes:grind <target> [--max-iterations N] [--auto-loop] [--with-api-review]`\n\nStart a Grimes Grind on the specified target.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `target` (required): What to grind - file path, description, or \"this\" for current context\n- `--max-iterations N`: Maximum iterations before stopping (default: 5)\n- `--auto-loop`: Enable automatic iteration until GREEN verdict\n- `--with-api-review`: Enable Phase 2 API Correctness & Completeness review (default: false)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# One-shot grind on a file (Phase 1: Runtime Reliability only)\n/frank-grimes:grind ./src/auth.py\n\n# Grind with API review enabled (Phase 1 + Phase 2)\n/frank-grimes:grind ./src/api --with-api-review\n\n# Red team an architecture proposal\n/frank-grimes:grind \"The proposal to use MongoDB for our financial transaction system\"\n```\n\n### `/frank-grimes:cancel`\n\nCancel an active Grimes Grind loop and report final status.\n\n### `/frank-grimes:help`\n\nDisplay help and usage information for the Grimes Grind plugin.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### The Grimes Grind Process\n\n1. **Phase 1: The Grimey Read** - Understand what you're critiquing (max 3 clarifying questions)\n2. **Phase 2: Default Assumptions** - Assume it's broken in every way\n3. **Phase 3: The Grind** - Systematically attack across 17 categories\n4. **Phase 4: The Rebuild** - Propose fixes with regression scope\n5. **Phase 5: Re-Grind (Scoped)** - Verify fixes didn't introduce new problems\n6. **Phase 6: Stop Conditions** - Determine verdict\n\n### Verdicts\n\n| Verdict | Meaning |\n|---------|---------|\n| 🟢 **GREEN** | All P0 mitigated, P1 planned, verification exists, observability sufficient |\n| 🟡 **YELLOW** | P0 mitigated but P1 weak, partial verification, needs monitoring |\n| 🔴 **RED** | P0 unmitigated, no verification, blocking issues remain |\n\n### Auto-Loop Behavior\n\nWhen `--auto-loop` is enabled:\n1. The stop hook intercepts exit attempts\n2. If verdict is not GREEN and iterations remain, the grind continues\n3. State is persisted in `.grimes-state.json`\n4. Loop exits when GREEN or max iterations reached\n\n## Phase Structure\n\n### Phase 1: Runtime Reliability & Production Blocking (Always Active)\n\nFocuses on P0/P1 defects that would prevent production deployment:\n- Syntax errors, compilation failures\n- Unhandled errors in critical paths\n- Resource leaks (timeouts, cleanup, OOM)\n- Security issues (credentials, injection, auth)\n\n**Verdict:** GREEN/YELLOW/RED based on blocking issues\n\n**Output:** GRIMES_REPORT.md with risk register, fixes, and deployment checklist\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: API Correctness & Completeness (Optional, --with-api-review)\n\nFocuses on P1/P2 API quality issues:\n- Package path correctness (`go_package`, Python imports)\n- Feature completeness (no unfinished TODOs in production)\n- Public interface documentation (godoc, docstrings)\n- API consistency (error returns, naming patterns)\n- Language best practices (no bare except, idiomatic code)\n\n**Verdict:** API Quality Score (0-100) + categorized findings\n\n**Output:** API_QUALITY_REPORT.md with score breakdown and technical debt backlog\n\n**When to use Phase 2:**\n- After Phase 1 is GREEN (API quality doesn't block production)\n- When scheduling technical debt sprints\n- For comprehensive code quality assessment\n- When handoff to different team requires API documentation\n\n---\n\n## Critique Categories\n\nThe grind checks across these dimensions:\n\n### Core Categories\n\n| Category | Focus |\n|----------|-------|\n| LLM Slop Check | Hallucinated APIs, cargo-culting, confident nonsense |\n| Correctness | Does it actually work? Invariants enforced? |\n| Reliability | Failure handling, retries, timeouts |\n| Security | Input validation, auth, secrets, injection |\n| Error Handling | Caught, logged, surfaced, or swallowed? |\n| Edge Cases | Null, empty, unicode, timezones, leap seconds |\n| Scalability | 10x? 100x? Where's the bottleneck? |\n| Observability | Metrics, logs, traces, alerts |\n| Testability | Tests exist? Test the right things? |\n| Maintainability | Understandable in 6 months? |\n| Dependencies | Reliable? Maintained? Upgrade path? |\n| Deployment | Rollback? Feature flags? YOLO push? |\n| Privacy & Data | PII, retention, GDPR |\n| Compliance | Audit logs, SOC 2, domain-specific |\n| Cost | Run cost, maintenance burden |\n| Human Factors | Will people use it correctly? |\n| Failure Modes | How does it die? Blast radius? |\n\n## Output: The Grimes Report\n\nEvery grind produces a structured report:\n\n```markdown\n## Grimes Grind Report: [Subject]\n\n### Verdict: 🟢 GREEN | 🟡 YELLOW | 🔴 RED\n\n**Top 3 Risks:**\n1. ...\n2. ...\n3. ...\n\n### Risk Register\n| ID | Category | Risk Statement | Severity | Likelihood | Blast Radius | Evidence | Status |\n...\n\n### Can't Prove Wrong (Survived Scrutiny)\n| Claim | Supporting Evidence | What Would Falsify It |\n...\n\n### Grimey's Final Word\n[One brutal sentence of truth]\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `jq` - Required for the stop hook to parse state JSON\n\nInstall on macOS: `brew install jq`\nInstall on Ubuntu: `apt-get install jq`\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\nThe skill warns against these failure modes:\n\n- **Grimey Theater**: Going through motions without genuine skepticism\n- **Optimism Creep**: \"It'll probably be fine\" - NO. Prove it.\n- **Authority Deference**: \"The LLM said so\" - Verify anyway.\n- **Perfection Paralysis**: Never shipping because something might be wrong\n- **Orphaned Risks**: Accepted risks with no owner\n\n## Credits\n\n- Methodology inspired by pre-mortems, red teaming, and threat modeling\n- Loop technique inspired by similar pessimistic iteration approaches\n- Named after Frank Grimes from The Simpsons, S8E23 \"Homer's Enemy\"\n\n---\n\n*\"You know what makes me mad? Not just that this is broken - it's that someone shipped it thinking it was fine. That's the real failure.\"*\n— The Spirit of Grimey\n"
