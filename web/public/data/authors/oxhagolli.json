        "README.md": "# clawdskillz\n\nEngineering mindset skills for Claude Code. These skills activate different professional personas - skeptical engineers, pragmatic PMs, rigorous thinkers - to improve the quality of AI-assisted development.\n\n## Skills Overview\n\n| Skill | Phase | Purpose |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| **self-doubt** | Meta | Question your reasoning step-by-step |\n| **venture-capitalist** | Pre-product | Validate business ideas, research competitors |\n| **product-manager** | Planning | Scope features, clarify requirements |\n| **skeptic-engineer** | Planning | Poke holes in technical approaches |\n| **test-engineer** | Planning | Surface edge cases and scenarios |\n| **parallel-orchestrator** | Plan→Impl | Break work into parallel subagent streams |\n| **framework-engineer** | Implementation | Research libraries, find deprecations |\n| **brevity-engineer** | Implementation | Ensure minimal, spec-aligned code |\n| **linting-engineer** | Implementation | Run linters, enforce type consistency |\n| **test-writer** | Implementation | Write fast, meaningful tests |\n| **documentation-engineer** | Implementation | Maintain CLAUDE.md and docs |\n| **scaffold-engineer** | Setup | Initialize projects with proper tooling |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Install via Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nAdd the marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add oxhagolli/clawdskillz\n```\n\nThen install the plugin set you want:\n\n```\n# Install all skills\n/plugin install all-skills@clawdskillz\n\n# Or install by category\n/plugin install planning-skills@clawdskillz\n/plugin install implementation-skills@clawdskillz\n/plugin install setup-skills@clawdskillz\n/plugin install thinking-skills@clawdskillz\n```\n\n### Option 2: Install Directly\n\nInstall a specific plugin directly:\n\n```\n/plugin install all-skills@oxhagolli/clawdskillz\n```\n\n### Option 3: Copy to Your Project\n\nCopy the skills you want into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/oxhagolli/clawdskillz.git\n\n# Copy specific skills\ncp -r clawdskillz/skills/skeptic-engineer .claude/skills/\ncp -r clawdskillz/skills/product-manager .claude/skills/\n```\n\n### Option 4: Add to CLAUDE.md\n\nCopy the content of any SKILL.md directly into your project's CLAUDE.md:\n\n```bash\ncat clawdskillz/skills/skeptic-engineer/SKILL.md >> CLAUDE.md\n```\n\n## Plugin Sets\n\n### thinking-skills\n- `self-doubt` - Rigorous step-by-step reasoning with self-questioning\n\n### planning-skills\n- `venture-capitalist` - Business validation, competitor research, market analysis\n- `product-manager` - Requirements, scope control, clarity\n- `skeptic-engineer` - Technical approach critique, architecture risks\n- `test-engineer` - Edge cases, scenarios to handle during planning\n- `parallel-orchestrator` - Break approved plans into parallel subagent work streams\n\n### implementation-skills\n- `framework-engineer` - Library selection, deprecation checks, best practices\n- `brevity-engineer` - Code minimalism, repo standards, scope in code\n- `linting-engineer` - Lint execution, type checking, type consistency\n- `test-writer` - Integration tests, fast tests, pragmatic coverage\n- `documentation-engineer` - CLAUDE.md per directory, ARCHITECTURE.md\n\n### setup-skills\n- `scaffold-engineer` - Project initialization with pyscaffold, pre-commit\n\n### all-skills\nAll of the above.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, skills activate automatically based on context. You can also invoke them explicitly:\n\n```\nApply the skeptic-engineer skill: I'm planning to rewrite our auth system to use JWTs...\n\nUse self-doubt: Walk me through why this algorithm is O(n log n)...\n\nApply venture-capitalist: I want to build a new SaaS for...\n```\n\n## Skill Separation\n\nEach skill has a clear domain and explicitly defers to other skills:\n\nIdea & Design:\n```\nventure-capitalist → \"Should this exist?\" (market, competition)\n        ↓\nproduct-manager → \"What exactly should it do?\" (scope, requirements)\n        ↓\nskeptic-engineer → \"Will this approach work?\" (architecture, risks)\n        ↓\ntest-engineer → \"What scenarios must we handle?\" (edge cases)\n```\n\nPlan to Implementation:\n```\nparallel-orchestrator → \"How do we parallelize this?\" (subagent coordination)\n        ↓\n   ┌────┴────┐\n   ▼         ▼\n[Subagent] [Subagent]  → Each runs implementation skills\n   └────┬────┘\n        ▼\n   Integration\n```\n\nImplementation (per subagent):\n```\nframework-engineer → \"Which libraries should we use?\" (dependencies)\n        ↓\nbrevity-engineer → \"Is this code minimal?\" (scope in code)\n        ↓\nlinting-engineer → \"Does this pass checks?\" (lint, types)\n        ↓\ntest-writer → \"Are tests meaningful and fast?\" (test implementation)\n        ↓\ndocumentation-engineer → \"Is this documented?\" (CLAUDE.md, docs)\n```\n\n## License\n[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE)\n"
