        "README.md": "# Dewey -- Knowledge Base Management for Claude Code\n\n> **Archived:** This was a learning project. Active development has moved to [bcbeidel/wos](https://github.com/bcbeidel/wos).\n\nDewey is a Claude Code plugin that helps you build, curate, and maintain structured knowledge bases. It implements a specification for role-specific knowledge bases that serve both AI agents and humans.\n\n## Why\n\nAI agents produce better outputs when they have access to curated, relevant knowledge. But knowledge bases serve two consumers: the **agent** (who needs structured, token-efficient context) and the **human** (who needs readable, navigable content). Dewey defines a standard for what a well-formed knowledge base looks like and provides skills to create and maintain one.\n\nDewey currently runs as a Claude Code plugin. The knowledge base output format is designed to be provider-agnostic -- cross-provider support (Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, etc.) is a future goal.\n\n## Installation\n\nRequires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) v1.0.33 or later.\n\n**Add the marketplace and install:**\n\n```bash\n# Add the Dewey marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add bcbeidel/dewey\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install dewey@bcbeidel-dewey\n```\n\nOr browse and install interactively:\n\n```bash\n# Open the plugin manager, then go to the Discover tab\n/plugin\n```\n\n**Choose an installation scope** when prompted:\n\n- **User** -- available across all your projects\n- **Project** -- shared with collaborators via `.claude/settings.json`\n- **Local** -- just you, just this repo\n\nAfter installing, restart Claude Code. Dewey's skills will be available as `/dewey:curate`, `/dewey:health`, and `/dewey:report-issue`.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/dewey:curate` | Single entry point for all knowledge-base content operations: discover domains, scaffold structure, add/update topics, ingest URLs, manage proposals and curation plan |\n| `/dewey:health` | Validate quality, check freshness, analyze coverage gaps, generate reports |\n| `/dewey:report-issue` | Submit bug reports, feature ideas, or feedback to the Dewey GitHub repo |\n\n### `/dewey:curate`\n\nThe curate skill uses free-text intake -- describe what you want and Claude routes to the right workflow. No subcommands needed.\n\n**Workflows:**\n\n- **discover** -- Guided conversation to identify what knowledge domains matter for a role, then scaffold the structure\n- **setup** -- Bootstrap a new knowledge base with directory structure, AGENTS.md, and templates\n- **add** -- Research a topic, draft working-knowledge and reference files, update all indexes (also supports updating existing topics)\n- **propose** -- Submit a topic proposal for review before committing\n- **promote** -- Move a validated proposal into a domain area\n- **ingest** -- Ingest an external URL, evaluate source quality, then propose new content or update existing topics\n- **plan** -- Create or update a curation plan that tracks coverage goals\n\n```\n# Just tell it what you want:\n/dewey:curate I want to start a knowledge base for platform engineering\n/dewey:curate add a topic about dependency injection in python-foundations\n/dewey:curate ingest https://example.com/article-about-observability\n/dewey:curate what's in my curation plan?\n```\n\n### `/dewey:health`\n\nThree-tier health model for knowledge base validation:\n\n**Tier 1 -- Deterministic (Python):** 18 validators in `validators.py` plus 6 cross-file validators in `cross_validators.py`. Checks frontmatter, section ordering, cross-references, size bounds, coverage gaps, freshness, source URLs, readability (Flesch-Kincaid), duplicate content, naming conventions, and more. Auto-fix available for common issues.\n\n**Tier 2 -- LLM-Assisted (Claude):** Pre-screener with 9 triggers in `tier2_triggers.py` flags files needing deeper review. Claude evaluates: source drift, depth accuracy, why-quality, in-practice concreteness, source primacy, citation quality, source authority, provenance completeness, recommendation coverage.\n\n**Tier 3 -- Human Judgment:** Surfaces decisions requiring human input: relevance questions, scope decisions, pending proposals, conflict resolution.\n\n```\n/dewey:health check my knowledge base\n/dewey:health what's gone stale?\n/dewey:health run a full audit\n```\n\n## Knowledge Base Structure\n\nA Dewey-conformant knowledge base looks like:\n\n```\nproject-root/\n  AGENTS.md                          # Role persona + topic manifest\n  .claude/rules/dewey-kb.md           # KB instructions + domain area index\n  docs/\n    <domain-area>/\n      overview.md                    # Area orientation (depth: overview)\n      <topic>.md                     # Working knowledge (depth: working)\n      <topic>.ref.md                 # Expert reference (depth: reference)\n    _proposals/                      # Staged additions pending review\n  .dewey/\n    health/                          # Quality scores and tier 2 reports\n    history/                         # Health check snapshots over time\n    utilization/                     # Reference tracking log\n```\n\nEvery knowledge file carries YAML frontmatter: `sources`, `last_validated`, `relevance`, and `depth`.\n\n## Design Principles\n\nTwelve principles grounded in agent context research (Anthropic, OpenAI) and cognitive science (Sweller, Vygotsky, Paivio, Bjork, Pirolli, Kalyuga, Dunlosky).\n\n### From Agent Context Research\n\n1. **Source Primacy** -- The knowledge base is a curated guide, not a replacement for primary sources. Every entry points to one. When an agent or human needs to go deeper, the path is always clear.\n2. **Dual Audience** -- Every entry serves the agent (structured, token-efficient context) and the human (readable, navigable content). When these conflict, favor human readability -- agents are more adaptable readers.\n3. **Three-Dimensional Quality** -- Content quality measured across relevance, accuracy/freshness, and structural fitness simultaneously.\n4. **Collaborative Curation** -- Either the human or an agent can propose additions, but all content passes through validation. The human brings domain judgment. The agent brings systematic coverage. Neither is sufficient alone.\n5. **Provenance & Traceability** -- Every piece of knowledge carries metadata about where it came from, when it was last validated, and why it's in the knowledge base.\n6. **Domain-Shaped Organization** -- Organized around the domain's natural structure, not file types or technical categories. The taxonomy should feel intuitive to a practitioner.\n7. **Right-Sized Scope** -- Contains what's needed to be effective in the role, and no more. The curation act is as much about what you exclude as what you include.\n8. **Empirical Feedback** -- Observable signals about knowledge base health: coverage gaps, stale entries, unused content. Proxy metrics inform curation decisions.\n9. **Progressive Disclosure** -- Layered access so agents can discover what's available without loading everything. Metadata -> summaries -> full content -> deep references.\n\n### From Cognitive Science Research\n\n10. **Explain the Why** -- Causal explanations produce better comprehension and retention than stating facts alone. Every entry explains not just what to do, but why.\n11. **Concrete Before Abstract** -- Lead with examples and worked scenarios, then build toward the abstraction. Concrete concepts create stronger memory traces.\n12. **Multiple Representations** -- Important concepts should exist at multiple levels of depth (overview, working knowledge, reference). Material that helps novices can hinder experts and vice versa -- label each level clearly so readers self-select.\n\nSee the [design principles reference](dewey/skills/health/references/design-principles.md) for detailed rationale and research sources.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- Python 3.9+ (stdlib only -- zero dependencies)\n- Markdown with YAML frontmatter\n- Claude Code skills framework\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey.git\ncd dewey\n\n# Load the plugin from your local clone for development\nclaude --plugin-dir ./dewey\n\n# Run tests\npython3 -m pytest tests/ -v\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ndewey/\n  .claude-plugin/plugin.json         # Plugin manifest\n  skills/\n    curate/                           # All knowledge-base content operations\n      SKILL.md\n      scripts/create_topic.py, propose.py, promote.py, scaffold.py, templates.py, config.py\n      workflows/curate-discover.md, curate-setup.md, curate-add.md, curate-propose.md,\n               curate-promote.md, curate-ingest.md, curate-plan.md\n      references/knowledge-base-spec-summary.md, source-evaluation.md\n    health/                           # Quality validation\n      SKILL.md\n      scripts/validators.py, cross_validators.py, auto_fix.py, check_knowledge_base.py,\n              tier2_triggers.py, history.py, utilization.py, log_access.py,\n              hook_log_access.py\n      workflows/health-check.md, health-audit.md, health-review.md,\n               health-coverage.md, health-freshness.md\n      references/validation-rules.md, quality-dimensions.md, design-principles.md\n    report-issue/                       # GitHub issue submission\n      SKILL.md\n      workflows/report-issue-submit.md\ntests/                                # Test suite (536 tests)\n```\n\n## Status\n\n| Feature | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| Knowledge base scaffolding | Complete |\n| Domain discovery | Complete |\n| Content lifecycle (add, propose, promote) | Complete |\n| URL ingestion with source evaluation | Complete |\n| Curation plan management | Complete |\n| Tier 1 deterministic health checks | Complete (18 validators + 6 cross-validators) |\n| Tier 2 LLM-assisted health assessments | Complete (9 triggers + audit workflow) |\n| Readability and duplicate content detection | Complete |\n| Auto-fix for common issues | Complete |\n| Health history and baselines | Complete |\n| Utilization tracking | Infrastructure complete, auto-capture pending ([#3](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/3)) |\n| Tier 3 human decision queue | Designed, not yet tested ([#2](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/2)) |\n| CI/CD eval pipeline | Planned ([#4](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/4)) |\n| Cross-provider support | Planned — [MCP server](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/1), [Cursor](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/5), [Copilot/Codex](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/6), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/7), [Windsurf](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/8) |\n| Research: design principle validation | Planned — [context effectiveness](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/9), [cognitive load](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/10), [information foraging](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/11), [source provenance](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/12), [multi-agent sharing](https://github.com/bcbeidel/dewey/issues/13) |\n\n## What We Learned\n\n- **Three-tier validation model** -- Deterministic checks are cheap and catch most issues. LLM-assisted checks add judgment but need a pre-screener to avoid waste. Human judgment is the hardest tier to operationalize.\n- **Skill consolidation** -- Started with separate explore/init/curate skills, converged to one free-text intake skill (curate) that routes internally. Simpler UX, same power.\n- **Stdlib-only constraint** -- Zero dependencies kept the project portable and easy to test, but the document type system research pushed toward Pydantic for schema validation -- a sign the project was outgrowing the constraint.\n- **Design principles grounded in research** -- The 12 principles (cognitive science + agent context research) gave the project a backbone that guided every content decision. Worth the upfront investment.\n- **Agent + human dual audience** -- Writing for both consumers is the core tension. Favor human readability since agents adapt more easily.\n- **Knowledge base as curation problem** -- What you exclude matters as much as what you include. The hardest part isn't adding content, it's deciding what doesn't belong.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Design Principles](dewey/skills/health/references/design-principles.md) -- The twelve principles guiding knowledge base content\n- [Knowledge Base Spec Summary](dewey/skills/curate/references/knowledge-base-spec-summary.md) -- Structural specification reference\n- [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) -- Release history\n"
