If you are using **coding agents**, that is the best fit.\n\n- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.\n\n- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns. Learn more about [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Token-efficient**. Does not force page data into LLM.\n\n### Requirements\n- Node.js 18 or newer\n- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other coding agent.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest\nplaywright-cli --help\n```\n\n### Installing skills\n\nClaude Code, GitHub Copilot and others will use the locally installed skills.\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli install --skills\n```\n\n### Skills-less operation\n\nPoint your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `playwright-cli --help` on its own:\n\n```\nTest the \"add todo\" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.\nCheck playwright-cli --help for available commands.\n```\n\n## Demo\n\n```\n> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.\n  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios. \n```\n\nYour agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:\n\n```\nplaywright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed\nplaywright-cli type \"Buy groceries\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli type \"Water flowers\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli check e21\nplaywright-cli check e35\nplaywright-cli screenshot\n```\n\n## Headed operation\n\nPlaywright CLI is headless by default. If you'd like to see the browser, pass `--headed` to `open`:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev --headed\n```\n\n## Sessions\n\nPlaywright CLI keeps the browser profile in memory by default. Your cookies and storage state\nare preserved between CLI calls within the session, but lost when the browser closes. Use\n`--persistent` to save the profile to disk for persistence across browser restarts.\n\nYou can use different instances of the browser for different projects with sessions. Pass `-s=` to\nthe invocation to talk to a specific browser.\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev\nplaywright-cli -s=example open https://example.com --persistent\nplaywright-cli list\n```\n\nYou can run your coding agent with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nPLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo-app claude .\n```\n\nOr instruct it to prepend `-s=` to the calls.\n\nManage your sessions as follows:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli list                     # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli close-all                # close all browsers\nplaywright-cli kill-all                 # forcefully kill all browser processes\n```\n\n## Monitoring\n\nUse `playwright-cli show` to open a visual dashboard that lets you see and control all running\nbrowser sessions. This is useful when your coding agents are running browser automation in the\nbackground and you want to observe their progress or step in to help.\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli show\n```\n\n<img width=\"1107\" height=\"729\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99df739d-106a-4520-b004-bb315db41da7\" />\n\nThe dashboard opens a window with two views:\n\n- **Session grid** — shows all active sessions grouped by workspace, each with a live screencast\n  preview, session name, current URL, and page title. Click any session to zoom in.\n- **Session detail** — shows a live view of the selected session with a tab bar, navigation\n  controls (back, forward, reload, address bar), and full remote control. Click into the viewport\n  to take over mouse and keyboard input; press Escape to release.\n\nFrom the grid you can also close running sessions or delete data for inactive ones.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Core\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open [url]               #

Default to automatic file naming, use `--filename=` when artifact is a part of the workflow result.\n\n### Sessions\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli -s=name <cmd>            # run command in named session\nplaywright-cli -s=name close            # stop a named browser\nplaywright-cli -s=name delete-data      # delete user data for named browser\nplaywright-cli list                     # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli close-all                # close all browsers\nplaywright-cli kill-all                 # forcefully kill all browser processes\n```\n\n### Local installation\n\nIn some cases you might want to install playwright-cli locally. If running the globally available `playwright-cli` binary fails, use `npx playwright-cli` to run the commands. For example:\n\n```bash\nnpx playwright-cli open https://example.com\nnpx playwright-cli click e1\n```\n\n## Configuration file\n\nThe Playwright CLI can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file using the `--config` command line option:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli --config path/to/config.json open example.com\n```\n\nPlaywright CLI will load config from `playwright-cli.json` by default so that you did not need to specify it every time.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Configuration file schema</summary>\n\n```typescript\n{\n  /**\n   * The browser to use.\n   */\n  browser?: {\n    /**\n     * The type of browser to use.\n     */\n    browserName?: 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit';\n\n    /**\n     * Keep the browser profile in memory, do not save it to disk.\n     */\n    isolated?: boolean;\n\n    /**\n     * Path to a user data directory for browser profile persistence.\n     * Temporary directory is created by default.\n     */\n    userDataDir?: string;\n\n    /**\n     * Launch options passed to\n     * @see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context\n     *\n     * This is useful for settings options like `channel`, `headless`, `executablePath`, etc.\n     */\n    launchOptions?: playwright.LaunchOptions;\n\n    /**\n     * Context options for the browser context.\n     *\n     * This is useful for settings options like `viewport`.\n     */\n    contextOptions?: playwright.BrowserContextOptions;\n\n    /**\n     * Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint to connect to an existing browser instance in case of Chromium family browsers.\n     */\n    cdpEndpoint?: string;\n\n    /**\n     * CDP headers to send with the connect request.\n     */\n    cdpHeaders?: Record<string, string>;\n\n    /**\n     * Timeout in milliseconds for connecting to CDP endpoint.

More skills are being added, existing skills are being updated to use the latest SDK patterns, and tests are being expanded to ensure quality. Contributions welcome!\n\nSkills, custom agents, AGENTS.md templates, and MCP configurations for AI coding agents working with Azure SDKs and Microsoft AI Foundry.\n\n> **Blog post:** [Context-Driven Development: Agent Skills for Microsoft Foundry and Azure](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/context-driven-development-agent-skills-for-microsoft-foundry-and-azure/)\n\n> **🔍 Skill Explorer:** [Browse all 130 skills with 1-click install](https://microsoft.github.io/skills/)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add microsoft/skills\n```\n\nSelect the skills you need from the wizard. Skills are installed to your chosen agent's directory (e.g., `.github/skills/` for GitHub Copilot) and symlinked if you use multiple agents.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Alternative installation methods</summary>\n\n**Manual installation (git clone)**\n\n```bash\n# Clone and copy specific skills\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/skills.git\ncp -r agent-skills/.github/skills/azure-cosmos-db-py your-project/.github/skills/\n\n# Or use symlinks for multi-project setups\nln -s /path/to/agent-skills/.github/skills/mcp-builder /path/to/your-project/.github/skills/mcp-builder\n\n# Share skills across different agent configs in the same repo\nln -s ../.github/skills .opencode/skills\nln -s ../.github/skills .claude/skills\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\nCoding agents like [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) are powerful, but they lack domain knowledge about your SDKs. The patterns are already in their weights from pretraining. All you need is the right activation context to surface them.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> **Use skills selectively.** Loading all skills causes context rot: diluted attention, wasted tokens, conflated patterns.

        "plugin/README.md": "# Azure\n\n[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. This plugin connects [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) or Claude Code to your Azure account, letting you manage resources, deploy applications, and monitor services directly from your development environment.\n\n## Setup\n\n### 1. Create an Azure Account\n\nSign up at [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com) or use your existing Azure account.\n\n### 2. Install Node.js and NPM\n\nThe Azure MCP Server runs as an NPM package. Ensure you have Node.js 18 or later installed:\n\n- Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)\n- Or use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)\n\n### 3. Authenticate to Azure\n\nThe Azure MCP Server uses the Azure Identity SDK for authentication. You can authenticate using any of these methods:\n\n#### Option A: Azure CLI (Recommended)\n1. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\n2. Run `az login` to authenticate\n3. The MCP server will automatically use your CLI credentials\n\n#### Option B: Environment Variables\nSet Azure service principal credentials:\n\n**Bash/Zsh:**\n```bash\nexport AZURE_TENANT_ID=\"your-tenant-id\"\nexport AZURE_CLIENT_ID=\"your-client-id\"\nexport AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your-client-secret\"\n```\n\n**PowerShell:**\n```powershell\n$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = \"your-tenant-id\"\n$env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID = \"your-client-id\"\n$env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = \"your-client-secret\"\n```\n\n#### Option C: Managed Identity\nWhen running on Azure resources (VMs, Container Apps, etc.), the server automatically uses managed identity.\n\nFor more authentication options, see the [Azure Identity documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/).\n\n### 4. Install the Plugins\n# Add the repo as a plugin marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add microsoft/github-copilot-for-azure\n\n# Pull in the Azure plugin\n/plugin install azure@github-copilot-for-azure\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe Azure MCP Server provides tools for 40+ Azure services:\n\n### AI & Machine Learning\n- Microsoft Foundry (AI models, deployments, knowledge indexes)\n- Azure AI Search (search and vector database)\n- Azure AI Services Speech (speech-to-text, text-to-speech)\n\n### Compute & Containers\n- Azure App Service, Container Apps, AKS\n- Azure Functions, Virtual Desktop\n\n### Storage & Databases\n- Azure Storage (Blob, File Sync)\n- Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB\n- Azure Database for MySQL & PostgreSQL\n\n### Security & Networking\n- Azure Key Vault (secrets, keys, certificates)\n- Azure RBAC (access control)\n- Azure Confidential Ledger\n\n### DevOps & Management\n- Resource Groups, Subscriptions\n- Azure Monitor (logging, metrics)\n- Azure CLI command generation\n- Bicep templates\n\n### Messaging & Communication\n- Azure Communication Services (SMS, email)\n- Azure Service Bus, Event Grid\n\nFor the complete list of 40+ services, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/).\n\n## Example Usage\n\nAsk GitHub Copilot CLI or Claude Code to:\n- \"List my Azure storage accounts\"\n- \"Show me all containers in my Cosmos DB database\"\n- \"List all secrets in my key vault 'my-vault'\"\n- \"Deploy a web app to Azure App Service\"\n- \"Query my Log Analytics workspace\"\n- \"List my AKS clusters\"\n- \"Send an SMS message to +1234567890 using Azure Communication Services\"\n- \"Generate an Azure CLI command to create a storage account\"\n\nFor more examples, visit the [Azure MCP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information, visit:\n- [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure)\n- [Azure CLI Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/)\n- [Azure REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Authentication Issues\n- Run `az login` to authenticate with Azure CLI\n- Verify you have appropriate Azure RBAC permissions\n- Check that your credentials are not expired\n- See the [Authentication guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/)\n\n### Server Issues\n- Ensure Node.js 18 or later is installed\n- Verify NPM can download packages from npmjs.com\n- Check the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)\n\n### Telemetry\nTo disable telemetry collection, set:\n```bash\nexport AZURE_MCP_COLLECT_TELEMETRY=false\n```\n"
