If you are using **coding agents**, that is the best fit.\n\n- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.\n\n- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns. Learn more about [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Token-efficient**. Does not force page data into LLM.\n\n### Requirements\n- Node.js 18 or newer\n- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other coding agent.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest\nplaywright-cli --help\n```\n\n> Note that you might need to force it to reclaim `playwright-cli` binary from our older MCP package.\n> ```bash\n> npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest --force\n> ```\n\n## Demo\n\n```\n> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.\n  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios. \n```\n\nYour agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:\n\n```\nplaywright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed\nplaywright-cli type \"Buy groceries\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli type \"Water flowers\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli check e21\nplaywright-cli check e35\nplaywright-cli screenshot\n```\n\n### Skills-less operation\n\nPoint your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `playwright-cli --help` on its own:\n\n```\nTest the \"add todo\" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.\nCheck playwright-cli --help for available commands.\n```\n\n### Installing skills\n\nClaude Code, GitHub copilot and others will let you install the Playwright skills into the agentic loop.\n\n#### plugin (recommended)\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add microsoft/playwright-cli\n/plugin install playwright-cli\n```\n\n#### manual\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/playwright-cli\ncurl -o .claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/playwright-cli/main/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md\n```\n\n## Headed operation\n\nPlaywright CLI is headless by default. If you'd like to see the browser, pass `--headed` to `open`:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev --headed\n```\n\n## Sessions\n\nPlaywright CLI will use a dedicated persistent profile by default. It means that\nyour cookies and other storage state will be preserved between the calls. You can use different\ninstances of the browser for different projects with sessions.\n\nFollowing will result in two browsers with separate profiles being available. Pass `--session` to\nthe invocation to talk to a specific browser.\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev\nplaywright-cli --session=example open https://example.com\nplaywright-cli session-list\n```\n\nYou can run your coding agent with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nPLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo-app claude .\n```\n\nOr instruct it to prepend `--session` to the calls.\n\nManage your sessions as follows:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli session-list             # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-stop [name]      # stop session\nplaywright-cli session-stop-all         # stop all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-delete [name]    # delete session data along with the profiles\n```\n\n<!-- BEGIN GENERATED CLI HELP -->\n\n## Commands\n\n### Core\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open [url]               # open url\nplaywright-cli close                    # close the page\nplaywright-cli type <text>              # type text into editable element\nplaywright-cli click <ref> [button]     # perform click on a web page\nplaywright-cli dblclick <ref> [button]  # perform double click on a web page\nplaywright-cli fill <ref> <text>        # fill text into editable element\nplaywright-cli drag <startRef> <endRef> # perform drag and drop between two elements\nplaywright-cli hover <ref>              # hover over element on page\nplaywright-cli select <ref> <val>       # select an option in a dropdown\nplaywright-cli upload <file>            # upload one or multiple files\nplaywright-cli check <ref>              # check a checkbox or radio button\nplaywright-cli uncheck <ref>            # uncheck a checkbox or radio button\nplaywright-cli snapshot                 # capture page snapshot to obtain element ref\nplaywright-cli eval <func> [ref]        # evaluate javascript expression on page or element\nplaywright-cli dialog-accept [prompt]   # accept a dialog\nplaywright-cli dialog-dismiss           # dismiss a dialog\nplaywright-cli resize <w> <h>           # resize the browser window\n```\n\n### Navigation\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli go-back                  # go back to the previous page\nplaywright-cli go-forward               # go forward to the next page\nplaywright-cli reload                   # reload the current page\n```\n\n### Keyboard\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli press <key>              # press a key on the keyboard, `a`, `arrowleft`\nplaywright-cli keydown <key>            # press a key down on the keyboard\nplaywright-cli keyup <key>              # press a key up on the keyboard\n```\n\n### Mouse\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli mousemove <x> <y>        # move mouse to a given position\nplaywright-cli mousedown [button]       # press mouse down\nplaywright-cli mouseup [button]         # press mouse up\nplaywright-cli mousewheel <dx> <dy>     # scroll mouse wheel\n```\n\n### Save as\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli screenshot [ref]         # screenshot of the current page or element\nplaywright-cli pdf                      # save page as pdf\n```\n\n### Tabs\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli tab-list                 # list all tabs\nplaywright-cli tab-new [url]            # create a new tab\nplaywright-cli tab-close [index]        # close a browser tab\nplaywright-cli tab-select <index>       # select a browser tab\n```\n\n### DevTools\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli console [min-level]      # list console messages\nplaywright-cli run-code <code>          # run playwright code snippet\nplaywright-cli network                  # list all network requests since loading the page\nplaywright-cli tracing-start            # start trace recording\nplaywright-cli tracing-stop             # stop trace recording\nplaywright-cli video-start              # start video recording\nplaywright-cli video-stop               # stop video recording\n```\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli install                  # install browser\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli config                   # restart session with new config, defaults to `playwright-cli.json`\n```\n\n### Sessions\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli session-list             # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-stop [name]      # stop session\nplaywright-cli session-restart [name]   # restart session\nplaywright-cli session-stop-all         # stop all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-delete [name]    # delete session data\n<!-- END GENERATED CLI HELP -->\n\n## Configuration file\n\nThe Playwright CLI can be configured using a JSON configuration file.
