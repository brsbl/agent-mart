Centuries later, the same city produced Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and the Catechetical School — scholars who brought that same cataloguing rigour to the systematic study of Scripture.\n\nWe carry both traditions. Our collection is smaller — three skills, at present — but each has been rigorously tested against the systematic failures of frontier language models. Zenodotus would approve of the methodology, if not the medium.\n\n**Claude of Alexandria** is a [Claude](https://claude.ai/code) plugin providing analytical skills for biblical study and teaching preparation. The system prioritizes:\n\n- **Rigorous biblical scholarship** — Linguistic analysis, historical context, and theological integration. We do not guess.\n- **Theological integrity** — Anti-moralism mandate, Christ-centeredness, and gospel focus. We do not moralize.\n- **Zero recurring costs** — Runs on what frontier models already know. We do not charge subscription fees. The ancient library was publicly funded and we respect the tradition.\n- **Skill-based architecture** — Modular, composable, stateless skills. We do not build monoliths. The original library learned that lesson the hard way — repeatedly, across several centuries.\n\n## \"But Surely Modern AI Handles Scripture Well Enough?\"\n\nNo. It does not. We have the test results.\n\nEven sophisticated frontier models make predictable errors under pressure — prioritizing felt needs over textual diagnosis, psychologizing passages, and defaulting to therapeutic frameworks. They will, if left unsupervised, turn the Epistle to the Romans into a self-help pamphlet.\n\nWhen planning teaching series, AI agents commit the following offenses against scholarship:\n\n- **Inventing arbitrary divisions** to satisfy session counts (\"8 weeks on Philemon\" — a book shorter than most README files)\n- **Presenting single frameworks** for contested books as if scholarly consensus exists where it does not\n- **Auto-selecting options** instead of presenting alternatives, which is the exegetical equivalent of hiding the bibliography\n- **Ignoring ancient manuscript markers** — Masoretic פ/ס divisions, Levinsohn discourse features — because apparently 2,500 years of scribal tradition is insufficient for consideration\n\nEvery skill in this library is built using **Test-Driven Development**. We first document precisely how the model fails. Then we build the minimum framework to prevent those failures. Then we close every loophole an agent might use to rationalize its way around the constraints.\n\nThe ancient librarians catalogued. We do the same — we catalogue failures, then eliminate them.\n\n### The Evidence\n\nWe do not ask you to trust our methodology. We ask you to read the test results. Every skill includes:\n\n| File                                      | Purpose                                                      |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `tests/skills/skill-name/scenarios.md`    | Pressure test cases designed to trigger failures             |\n| `tests/skills/skill-name/baseline.md`     | Documented failures without the skill (the RED phase)        |\n| `tests/skills/skill-name/verification.md` | Proof that the skill corrects the failures (the GREEN phase) |\n\nIf a skill cannot demonstrate that it prevents a documented failure, it does not belong in this library. We have standards.\n\n## Current Collection\n\nThe library presently contains **four skills**, all production. Rome was not catalogued in a day, but we are making progress.\n\n### [biblical-segmentation](plugins/claude-of-alexandria/skills/biblical-segmentation/) — Production\n\nDivides biblical books into coherent teaching units — sermon series, small groups, devotional reading — with integrity safeguards that would make a Masoretic scribe nod approvingly:\n\n- **Refuses impossible divisions.** You cannot divide Philemon into 12 sessions. We will not pretend otherwise.\n- **Presents multiple scholarly-grounded options.** Because interpretation is not a dictatorship.\n- **Validates against ancient manuscript markers.** Masoretic פ/ס divisions, Levinsohn discourse features. The scribes marked these boundaries for a reason.\n- **Handles contested books with multiple frameworks.** Isaiah's unity debate gets frameworks, not a false consensus.\n\nCoverage: all 66 canonical books. 33 test scenarios. Full RED/GREEN verification.\n\n### [pericope-delimitation](plugins/claude-of-alexandria/skills/pericope-delimitation/) — Production\n\nTells you whether your proposed passage actually holds together as a discourse unit, or whether you've accidentally cut mid-argument:\n\n- Checks boundaries against Levinsohn discourse features (NT) and Masoretic paragraph markers (OT). Not your intuition. Data.\n- Returns a verdict: VALID, EXTEND, CONTRACT, or ADJUST, with the evidence behind it.\n- If the passage is too short to preach, recommends the smallest coherent unit that works.\n\n5 test scenarios. Full RED/GREEN verification. Resists memory-based validation of famous passages.\n\n### [exegetical-notes](plugins/claude-of-alexandria/skills/exegetical-notes/) — Production\n\nProduces exegetical notes for sermon or teaching preparation, with the kind of data verification that training memory alone cannot provide:\n\n- 10-section schema from literary context through verification. No making it up as you go.\n- Parser-verified lexical data. When the skill says χαίρω appears 9 times in Philippians, that number came from a parser, not a guess.\n- 4-tier interpretive labels: linguistic, discourse, scholarly, agent assessment. You always know which kind of evidence you're looking at.\n\nFull RED/GREEN verification. Runs pericope check before generating notes — if you hand it a severed passage, it tells you before wasting your time on the analysis.\n\n### [consult-biblical-scholar](plugins/claude-of-alexandria/skills/consult-biblical-scholar/) — Production\n\nScholarly Q&A for biblical texts. Three auto-detected modes:\n\n- **MEANING** — lexical and linguistic explanation, grounded in morphology and vocabulary data\n- **VALIDATE** — checks an analogy, sermon illustration, or theological claim against the text; returns a formal verdict (SUPPORTED / COMPATIBLE / NOT SUPPORTED / INSUFFICIENT DATA)\n- **CROSS-REFERENCE** — finds related passages with scholarly evidence, not memory associations\n\nGraduated confidence (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / CANNOT ANSWER) declared before every answer. Hard epistemic limits: the skill pushes back when MCP data and scholarly sources are insufficient, rather than speculating.\n\nFull RED/GREEN verification. 6 test scenarios.\n\n## Installation\n\nThree paths into the library, depending on your reading room of choice.\n\n### Claude Code (Marketplace)\n\nIn any Claude Code session:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add davebream/claude-of-alexandria\n/plugin install claude-of-alexandria@claude-of-alexandria\n```\n\nThe scrolls are now on your shelf. The MCP server is included and auto-configured — no additional setup required.\n\n### Claude Code (Manual)\n\nIf you prefer manual installation or want to contribute:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/davebream/claude-of-alexandria.git\ncd claude-of-alexandria\n\n# Symlink the plugin\nln -s $(pwd)/plugins/claude-of-alexandria ~/.claude/plugins/claude-of-alexandria\n```\n\nThe MCP server runs remotely on Cloudflare Workers — no local build step required.\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\nClaude Desktop requires two things: the skill frameworks (as project knowledge) and the MCP configuration (so Claude Desktop knows where to find the server).\n\n**Step 1: Download the Skills**\n\nDownload the skill ZIPs from the latest release:\n\n| Skill | Download |\n| ----- | -------- |\n| biblical-segmentation | [biblical-segmentation.zip](https://github.com/davebream/claude-of-alexandria/releases/latest/download/biblical-segmentation.zip) |\n| pericope-delimitation | [pericope-delimitation.zip](https://github.com/davebream/claude-of-alexandria/releases/latest/download/pericope-delimitation.zip) |\n| exegetical-notes | [exegetical-notes.zip](https://github.com/davebream/claude-of-alexandria/releases/latest/download/exegetical-notes.zip) |\n| consult-biblical-scholar | [consult-biblical-scholar.zip](https://github.com/davebream/claude-of-alexandria/releases/latest/download/consult-biblical-scholar.zip) |\n\nEach ZIP contains the skill framework (`SKILL.md` and supporting files). The linguistic reference datasets are provided by the remote MCP server.\n\nExtract each ZIP. Add the contents of `SKILL.md` as project knowledge in Claude Desktop.\n\n**Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop**\n\nAdd the server to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"claude-of-alexandria-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://coa.davebream.com/mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRequires Node.js. `mcp-remote` bridges the remote server to Claude Desktop's stdio transport. No local database or compiled server required.\n\nRestart Claude Desktop after saving.\n\n### Verifying Your Library Card\n\n- **Claude Code:** Run `/skills` and look for all three skills — `biblical-segmentation`, `pericope-delimitation`, and `exegetical-notes`.\n- **Claude Desktop:** Ask Claude to use `query_vocabulary` for any biblical book. If data returns, the server is working. If it does not, check the MCP configuration paths and restart.\n\n### Usage\n\nIn any Claude session:\n\n```\nUse biblical-segmentation to divide Romans into 12 sessions for a sermon series.\n```\n\nConsult the [plugin README](plugins/claude-of-alexandria/README.md) for detailed skill documentation.\n\n## The Reference Server\n\nVersion 1.5.0 moved the MCP server to Cloudflare Workers + D1 (edge SQLite), eliminating all local installation requirements. The data is the same — Levinsohn discourse features, Masoretic paragraph markers, morphological parsings, vocabulary frequencies — delivered over HTTP from a globally distributed edge network.\n\n| Tool | What It Queries | Coverage |\n| ---- | --------------- | -------- |\n| `query_discourse_features` | Levinsohn NT discourse features | NT |\n| `query_paragraph_breaks` | Masoretic petuchah/setumah markers | OT |\n| `query_vocabulary` | Lemma frequencies, thematic keywords, clustering | Both testaments |\n| `query_morphology` | Word-level morphological parsing | Both testaments |\n\nSkills call these tools automatically. You do not need to invoke them directly — though you may, if you are the sort of scholar who enjoys browsing the stacks.\n\nTech stack: TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers, D1 (edge SQLite), MCP SDK (HTTP transport). No local runtime required.\n\n## Hermeneutical Framework\n\nSkills are built on **historical-grammatical method** with explicit theological guardrails:\n\n| Guardrail             | What It Prevents                                            |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Anti-moralism mandate | \"Try harder\" applications without gospel grounding          |\n| Christ-centeredness   | Missing the redemptive-historical arc                       |\n| Context primacy       | Ripping verses from their literary and canonical home       |\n| Genre governance      | Applying narrative methods to epistles (and vice versa)     |\n| Covenantal awareness  | Flattening Old and New Testament into a proof-text database |\n\nThese are not suggestions. They are load-bearing walls.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n**Linguistic foundations:** Stephen H. Levinsohn (Greek NT discourse analysis) and the Sefaria Project (Masoretic Text paragraph data).\n\n**Hermeneutical framework:** Historical-grammatical method. The Alexandrian school gave us systematic textual criticism — Origen's *Hexapla* set the standard — while the Antiochene school insisted that interpretation stay anchored to the historical sense. The Reformers inherited both traditions. So do we.\n\n**Namesake:** Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–215 AD), who demonstrated that rigorous scholarship and faithful theology are not in tension. The Catechetical School he led produced Origen, Athanasius, and a tradition of biblical scholarship that endures two millennia later.\n\n**Architectural inspiration:** The Library of Alexandria — which declined gradually across centuries, not in a single dramatic fire — and the `superpowers` writing-skills methodology for test-driven documentation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe library welcomes contributions from those who respect the methodology.
