Simply provide your project requirements and the skill will guide you through the 6-phase documentation generation process.\n\n## Overview\n\nA rigorous, evidence-based system that generates six interconnected architectural documents while **eliminating \"research slop\"** and preventing AI-generated misinformation. Every technological decision is backed by verifiable sources with complete traceability from research through implementation.\n\n## 🚨 CRITICAL: Preventing \"Research Slop\"\n\n**The Problem**: AI generates content that is polished, articulate, and inspires \"faith-like confidence,\" yet is often unverified and factually incorrect. This has led to:\n- **Legal sanctions** for law firms submitting fabricated citations\n- **Financial penalties** for consulting firms providing incorrect statistics\n- **Professional ruin** from relying on plausible-sounding falsehoods\n\n**Our Solution**: **Mandatory verification protocol** that transforms AI from \"confident author\" to \"diligent research assistant\" with auditable evidence trails.\n\n## 🎯 Evidence-Based Architecture\n\n**The quality of your architectural specification is directly proportional to the verifiability of your research evidence.**\n\n### What This Skill Does\n\n1. **Phase 0**: 🔍 **Verifiable Research** (Mandatory Web Search + Browsing + Citations)\n2. **Phase 1**: Architectural Blueprint (Evidence-Based Component Mapping)\n3. **Phase 2**: Requirements Generation (Research-Backed Acceptance Criteria)\n4. **Phase 3**: Detailed Design (Source-Validated Specifications)\n5. **Phase 4**: Task Decomposition (Traceable Implementation Plan)\n6. **Phase 5**: Validation & Traceability (100% Coverage + Evidence Verification)\n\n## 🚀 Example: Clear Input = Clear Output\n\n### User Prompt (High Quality):\n```\n\"I need to architect an inventory management system for a growing e-commerce business.\nThe system must handle 50,000 SKUs, integrate with our existing Shopify store,\nand provide real-time stock updates. We need barcode scanning, low-stock alerts,\nand supplier management. Please do NOT include POS functionality or customer-facing\nfeatures. Our team uses Node.js/React and we need cloud deployment with automatic backups.\"\n```\n\n### What This Prompt Provides:\n✅ **Clear Business Context**: E-commerce inventory management\n✅ **Specific Constraints**: 50,000 SKUs, Shopify integration, real-time updates\n✅ **Technology Stack**: Node.js/React, cloud deployment\n✅ **Clear Scope Boundaries**: No POS, no customer-facing features\n✅ **Success Metrics**: Barcode scanning, stock alerts, supplier management\n\n### Resulting Architecture Quality:\n🎯 **Clear Component Boundaries**: Each service has single responsibility\n🎯 **Explicit Data Flow**: Complete journey from barcode scan to inventory update\n🎯 **Defined Integration Points**: Shopify API, backup systems, cloud infrastructure\n🎯 **Traceable Requirements**: Every feature traced to implementation tasks\n🎯 **No Scope Creep**: Clear boundaries prevent \"feature additions\"\n\n## 📋 Generated Documents\n\n1. **research.md** - Web search findings, technology comparison, stack selection (NEW!)\n2. **blueprint.md** - Component mapping, data flow diagrams, integration points\n3. **requirements.md** - Testable acceptance criteria with component assignments\n4. **design.md** - Detailed component specifications and interfaces\n5. **tasks.md** - Implementation plan with requirement traceability\n6. **validation.md** - Automated validation confirming 100% coverage\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n- **🚫 Research Slop Prevention**: Mandatory verification eliminates AI-generated misinformation\n- **🔍 Evidence-Based Research**: Every claim supported by browsed sources with citations\n- **📋 Citation Protocol**: Strict `[cite:INDEX]` format creates auditable evidence trails\n- **🛡️ Professional Standards**: Prevents legal sanctions, financial penalties, and professional ruin\n- **Automated Validation**: Python script ensures 100% requirements coverage + evidence verification\n- **Source Verification**: Mandatory browsing of sources, not just search snippets\n- **Template Enforcement**: Guarantees consistency and completeness\n- **Component Consistency**: Exact name matching across all documents\n- **Traceability Matrix**: Complete mapping from requirements to tasks\n- **Quality Gates**: Sequential approval process with evidence verification\n\n## 🔍 Phase 0: VERIFIABLE Research - ANTI-SLOP PROTOCOL\n\n**CRITICAL**: This phase prevents the exact types of AI errors that cause legal sanctions and professional ruin.\n\n### Mandatory Verification Process:\n1. **Search THEN Browse**: Use WebSearch to find sources, then WebFetch to read actual content\n2. **NO Search Snippets**: You MUST read full source content, not just search results\n3. **Cite Every Claim**: Every factual statement MUST end with `[cite:INDEX]` citation\n4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Technology choices only from verified sources\n5. **Auditable Trail**: Complete citation trail from claim to source\n\n### Examples of What We Prevent:\n❌ **Research Slop**: \"Node.js is great for real-time apps\"\n✅ **Evidence-Based**: \"Node.js excels at real-time applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model [cite:1]\"\n\n❌ **Research Slop**: \"TypeScript reduces errors\"\n✅ **Evidence-Based**: \"TypeScript adds static typing that reduces runtime errors by approximately 15% in large codebases [cite:2]\"\n\n### Professional Impact:\nThis protocol prevents the types of errors that have led to:\n- **Legal sanctions** for law firms (fabricated citations)\n- **Financial penalties** for consulting firms (incorrect statistics)\n- **Professional ruin** from AI-generated misinformation\n\n## 🎖️ Critical Success Factors\n\n### 1. Research-Driven Decisions\nNever skip Phase 0! Web research ensures:\n- Current best practices and patterns\n- Proven technology stacks\n- Industry-specific considerations\n- Avoidance of outdated approaches\n\n### 2. Component Clarity\nEach component must have a single, well-defined responsibility. If you find yourself saying \"and also,\" split into multiple components.\n\n### 2. Data Flow Visualization\nMap how data moves through the system from input to output. The Mermaid diagram should show the complete journey.\n\n### 3. Integration Points\nClearly define all APIs, protocols, and external system connections. Specify data formats, authentication, and error handling.\n\n### 4. Boundaries Setting\nExplicitly define what's in scope vs. out of scope to prevent scope creep and enable accurate estimation.\n\n## 🔧 Usage\n\n1. **Provide Clear Requirements**: Include business objectives, constraints, and scope boundaries\n2. **Follow Sequential Phases**: Each phase builds upon the previous one\n3. **Review Quality Gates**: Ensure each phase meets quality criteria before proceeding\n4. **Validate Traceability**: Use the automated validator to confirm complete coverage\n\n## 📊 Validation Example\n\n```\nValidation Report:\n- Total Acceptance Criteria: 28\n- Criteria Covered by Tasks: 28\n- Coverage Percentage: 100%\n- Invalid References: 0\n✅ Plan validated and ready for execution\n```\n\n## 🎯 Bottom Line\n\n**Clear upfront goals + structured methodology = high-quality architectural specifications**\n\nThis skill transforms vague project ideas into concrete, implementable plans with guaranteed traceability from business requirements to implementation tasks.\n\n---\n\n*\"The best architectural plans come from the clearest upfront thinking.\"*\n"
