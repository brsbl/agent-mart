By explicitly defining system components, data flows, and integration points before diving into details, the documentation becomes comprehensive and actionable.\n\n## Quick Start\n### Claude install\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add adrianpuiu/claude-skills-marketplace\n\n/plugin install project-planner-skill@claude-skills-marketplace\n```\n\n## Document Types\n\n### Requirements Document\n- User stories in standard format\n- Testable acceptance criteria using SHALL statements\n- Requirement numbering for traceability\n- Glossary of domain terms\n\n### Design Document  \n- System architecture diagrams\n- Component responsibilities and interfaces\n- Data models and schemas\n- Error handling strategies\n- Deployment configuration\n\n### Implementation Plan\n- Hierarchical task breakdown\n- Requirement tracing (links tasks to requirements)\n- Dependency management between tasks\n- Progress tracking with checkboxes\n\n## Project Types Supported\n\n- **web-app**: Full-stack web applications\n- **cli-tool**: Command-line tools and utilities\n- **api-service**: REST/GraphQL API services\n- **generic**: General purpose projects\n\n## Files Included\n\n### Scripts\n- `generate_project_docs.py` - Automated document generation\n- `validate_documents.py` - Document validation and completeness checking\n\n### References\n- `domain-templates.md` - Domain-specific templates and patterns\n\n### Assets\n- `requirements-template.md` - Basic requirements document template\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with Requirements** - Define what the system should do before how\n2. **Be Specific** - Use measurable criteria (e.g., \"within 100ms\" not \"fast\")\n3. **Trace Requirements** - Link every task back to requirements\n4. **Include Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, scalability\n5. **Define Clear Interfaces** - Specify how components interact\n6. **Plan Incrementally** - Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Starting a New Project\n```\nUser: \"I want to build a real-time chat application\"\nAI: [Uses this skill to generate complete project documentation]\n```\n\n### Expanding Existing Project\n```\nUser: \"Add user authentication to my project requirements\"\nAI: [Adds properly formatted requirements with acceptance criteria]\n```\n\n### Creating Technical Specification\n```\nUser: \"Design the architecture for a microservices e-commerce platform\"\nAI: [Generates design document with components, interfaces, and deployment]\n```\n\n## Tips for AI Implementation\n\nWhen using these documents for AI-assisted development:\n\n1. **Requirements First** - Implement in order of requirement priority\n2. **Follow Task Dependencies** - Complete prerequisite tasks first\n3. **Test Against Acceptance Criteria** - Each SHALL statement is a test case\n4. **Reference Design Interfaces** - Use the specified APIs and data models\n5. **Track Progress** - Check off completed tasks in the implementation plan\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\nBefore using documents for implementation:\n\n- [ ] All placeholders ([PLACEHOLDER]) filled in\n- [ ] Requirements have testable acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Design includes all major components\n- [ ] Tasks reference requirement IDs\n- [ ] Dependencies between tasks identified\n- [ ] Non-functional requirements specified\n- [ ] Deployment configuration included\n\n## Example Output\n\nThe generated documents follow industry-standard formats that are:\n- **Machine-readable** - Structured for AI parsing\n- **Human-readable** - Clear for developers to understand  \n- **Version-control friendly** - Plain text Markdown format\n- **Traceable** - Requirements linked through all documents\n\nThis skill transforms high-level project ideas into actionable specifications that AI agents can use to build working software.\n",
