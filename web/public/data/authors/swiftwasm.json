        "README.md": "# SwiftWasm Agent Skills\n\nA collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) designed to help AI coding agents build and maintain Swift applications targeting WebAssembly.\n\n## What are Agent Skills?\n\nAgent Skills are specialized modules containing instructions, scripts, and documentation that give AI agents (like Claude, Gemini, or Codex) the domain expertise needed to perform complex tasks.\n\nThis repository is compatible with major agent tools, leveraging standardized formats to ensure your agent has the right context for SwiftWasm development.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n1. Add this repository as a plugin marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin marketplace add swiftwasm/skills\n   ```\n\n2. Install skills using a loop:\n   ```bash\n   for skill in javascriptkit bridgejs porting; do\n     claude plugin install ${skill}@swiftwasm-skills\n   done\n   ```\n\n### OpenAI Codex\n\nOpenAI Codex CLI and compatible tools support the Agent Skills format by searching specific directories.\n\n#### User-Level Installation\nTo make all skills from this repository available across all your projects:\n\n```bash\n# Create the Codex skills directory\nmkdir -p ~/.codex/skills\n\n# Clone and copy all skills\ngit clone https://github.com/swiftwasm/skills.git /tmp/swiftwasm-skills\nfor skill_path in /tmp/swiftwasm-skills/skills/*; do\n  [ -d \"$skill_path\" ] || continue\n  cp -r \"$skill_path\" ~/.codex/skills/\ndone\n```\n\n#### Project-Level Installation\nTo use skills only within a specific project:\n\n```bash\n# In your project root\nmkdir -p .codex/skills\nfor skill_path in /path/to/swiftwasm-skills/skills/*; do\n  [ -d \"$skill_path\" ] || continue\n  cp -r \"$skill_path\" .codex/skills/\ndone\n```\n\n### Gemini CLI\n\nThis repository includes a `gemini-extension.json` for integration. Install it using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngemini extensions install https://github.com/swiftwasm/skills.git --consent\n```\n\n### Cursor\n\nFor Cursor, please refer to [Installing Skills from GitHub](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#installing-skills-from-github).\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Name | Description | Documentation |\n|------|-------------|---------------|\n| `javascriptkit` | Assist with Swift & JavaScript interop, project initialization, and memory management for WebAssembly. | [SKILL.md](skills/javascriptkit/SKILL.md) |\n| `bridgejs` | Assist with BridgeJS for type-safe Swift-to-JavaScript bindings, exporting Swift APIs, and importing TypeScript definitions. | [SKILL.md](skills/bridgejs/SKILL.md) |\n| `porting` | Check Swift on Wasm compatibility, identify incompatible frameworks, port and refactor code for WebAssembly. | [SKILL.md](skills/porting/SKILL.md) |\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce a skill is installed or loaded, you can trigger its logic by mentioning relevant tasks to your agent. For example, using the `javascriptkit` skill:\n\n- \"Initialize a new JavaScriptKit project named 'MyWebApp' in the current directory.\"\n- \"How do I safely pass a Swift closure to a JavaScript event listener?\"\n- \"Check my environment using the doctor script to ensure I can build for Wasm.\"\n\nThe agent will automatically refer to the appropriate `SKILL.md` file and any associated helper scripts to fulfill your request.\n"
