        "README.md": "# Awesome AI\n\n**Curated Claude Code skills for thinkers, researchers, and strategists.**\n\nI built these skills to augment how I think, research, and make decisions. Now I'm sharing them with you.\n\n## Why This Exists\n\nMost AI tools give you answers. I wanted something different — tools that help me **think better**, not think less.\n\nThese skills are born from years of obsessing over:\n- **Rationality** — LessWrong, CFAR, Bayesian thinking\n- **Systems thinking** — feedback loops, second-order effects, leverage points\n- **Strategic frameworks** — theory of change, backcasting, WOOP\n- **Research methodology** — source validation, triangulation, confidence calibration\n\nEach skill encodes a methodology I actually use. They're opinionated, thorough, and designed to produce real output — not generic advice.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Command | Description | Usage |\n|---------|-------------|-------|\n| `/akorchak:deep-research` | Multi-source research with validation, source tiering (Tier 1-3), and confidence levels | `/akorchak:deep-research [topic]` |\n| `/akorchak:icp-generator` | B2B Ideal Customer Profiles with 5-dimension analysis, buyer personas, and scoring model | `/akorchak:icp-generator [company]` |\n| `/akorchak:strategy` | Strategic planning with goal validation, theory of change, WOOP, and phased roadmaps | `/akorchak:strategy [goal]` |\n| `/akorchak:thinking-session` | Deep thinking with Socratic dialogue, rationality frameworks (CFAR), and systems thinking | `/akorchak:thinking-session` |\n| `/akorchak:venture-assessment` | VC investment analysis with weighted scoring and INVESTABLE/NOT INVESTABLE verdict | `/akorchak:venture-assessment [company]` |\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# All commands have to be executed in Claude CLI tool\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add 57uff3r/awesome-ai\n\n# Install plugin\n/plugin install akorchak-awesome-ai\n\n# Restart Claude via /exit command \n# and all installed skills will appear in your system\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Structured over freeform.** Every skill follows a clear methodology with defined phases and outputs.\n\n**Rigorous over convenient.** Deep research requires source validation. Strategy requires stress-testing assumptions. Thinking sessions challenge, not validate.\n\n**Actionable over theoretical.** Skills produce artifacts — research reports, ICPs, strategy docs, assessment memos — not just conversations.\n\n## Author\n\n**Andrey Korchak**\n\nBuilding tools for better thinking.\n\n- Email: [me@akorchak.software](mailto:me@akorchak.software)\n- GitHub: [@57uff3r](https://github.com/57uff3r)\n\n## License\n\nMIT — use freely, attribution appreciated.\n"
