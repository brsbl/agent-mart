By using HTML anchors (`<a id=\"...\"></a>`) and standard Markdown links, you can define structured relationships (edges) between documents. This enables automated traceability across your entire documentation suite—from business actors and use cases down to technical requirements and architecture decisions.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide on concepts, architecture, and specifications, please refer to the **[Documentation Overview](./doc/overview.md)**.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Graph Validation**: Automated checks for broken links, duplicate IDs, and relationship rule violations defined in `docgraph.toml`.\n- **Traceability Analysis**: Tools to search, trace, and describe complex node relationships.\n- **AI-Agent Ready**: Built-in support for GraphRAG knowledge construction. AI Agents can consume `docgraph` outputs to assist in documentation and development workflows.\n- **Modern IDE Integration**: A dedicated VS Code plugin with full LSP support.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up `docgraph` for your project.\n\n### Step 1: Install CLI Binary\n\n`docgraph` requires the CLI binary to be installed on your system for all use cases (CLI, AI, and IDE).\n\n**macOS / Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonesuke/docgraph/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n**Windows (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\npowershell -c \"irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonesuke/docgraph/main/install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\n*Or build from source:* `cargo install --path .`\n\n### Step 2: Configure (`docgraph.toml`)\n\nCreate a `docgraph.toml` file in your project root to define your documentation architecture rules.\n\n```toml\n[node_types]\nUC = { desc = \"Use Case\" }\nFR = { desc = \"Functional Requirement\" }\n\n[references.FR]\nrules = [\n  { dir = \"from\", targets = [\"UC\"], min = 1, desc = \"Requirements must be derived from a use case\" }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment\n\nChoose how you want to interact with `docgraph`:\n\n#### Option A: Claude Code\n\n1. In a Claude chat, install the official plugin:\n   ```text\n   /plugin marketplace add sonesuke/docgraph\n   /plugin install docgraph-plugin@docgraph-claude-plugins\n   ```\n2. The AI agent will now automatically use the installed `docgraph` binary to analyze your documentation.\n\n   **Example Claude Interaction:**\n   > **You**: \"Build a knowledge graph from the current directory.\"\n   > **Claude**: \"Building knowledge graph... Done. Found 15 nodes and 24 relationships.\"\n   >\n   > **You**: \"What are the dependencies for UC_WRITE?\"\n   > **Claude**: \"UC_WRITE depends on ACT_USER and is realized by IF_CLI_LINT.\"\n\n#### Option B: VS Code Extension\n\n1. Download `docgraph.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sonesuke/docgraph/releases).\n2. Install via Command Palette (`Extensions: Install from VSIX...`) or CLI:\n   ```bash\n   code --install-extension docgraph.vsix\n   ```\n\n#### Option C: Standard CLI\n\nUse the commands directly in your terminal for validation and analysis:\n\n```bash\n# Validate the graph\ndocgraph check .\n\n# Trace relationships\ndocgraph trace UC_LOGIN FR_EMAIL_LOGIN\n```\n\n## CLI Commands Reference\n\n- `check [path]`: Validate the graph for broken links and rule violations.\n- `fmt [path]`: Automatically fix fixable formatting and lint issues.\n- `list <query>`: Search for nodes matching a pattern.\n- `trace <from> <to>`: Trace and visualize relationship paths.\n- `describe <id>`: Show bidirectional relationships for a specific node.\n- `lsp`: Start the Language Server for IDE support.\n\n\n\n---\n\nContributions are welcome! If you're interested in helping improve `docgraph`, please check out our **[Module View](./doc/architecture/view/module.md)** for an overview of the technical structure.\n\nDetailed technical documentation and use cases can be found in the **[Documentation Overview](./doc/overview.md)**.\n"
