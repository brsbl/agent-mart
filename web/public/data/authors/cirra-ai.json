        "cirra-ai-sf/README.md": "# cirra-ai-sf\n\nSalesforce orchestrator plugin for Claude Cowork. Coordinates the individual Salesforce plugins (Apex, Flow, Data, and others) into a unified admin suite.\n\nWhen installed, this plugin routes tasks to the appropriate sub-plugin based on context — e.g., Apex code reviews go to `cirra-ai-sf-apex`, data operations go to `cirra-ai-sf-data`.\n\nEach sub-plugin also works independently without the orchestrator.\n\n## Sample Prompts\n\n- \"Perform a thorough audit of the Apex classes and Flows in my Salesforce org. Use Cirra AI and the cirra-ai-sf plugin. Use the default org for Cirra AI. Please generate Word, HTML and Excel versions of the report.\"\n- \"I need a new custom object called Inspection\\_\\_c with fields for Status, Inspector, and Date. Then create an Apex trigger that auto-assigns inspectors based on region, a Screen Flow for field technicians to submit inspection results, and seed 50 test records so I can demo it. Do this in the default org for Cirra AI.\"\n- \"Review all Apex triggers in my org for bulkification issues and governor limit risks. For each issue found, suggest a fix and score the code. Do this in the default org for Cirra AI.\"\n\n## Model choice\n\nFor reports, analysis and simple metadata task the Sonnet model is a good and cost effective choice. For deeper thinking about how to best build new features or debug existing issues, the Opus model may be needed.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor installation instructions and the full plugin catalog, see the [root README](../README.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Cowork or Claude Code with skill plugins enabled\n- Cirra AI MCP Server\n- Target Salesforce org\n\n## License\n\nMIT License — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\nThis plugin is designed for use with Cirra AI, a commercial product developed by Cirra AI, Inc. The plugin and its contents are provided independently and are not part of the Cirra AI product itself. Use of Cirra AI is subject to its own separate terms and conditions.\n"
