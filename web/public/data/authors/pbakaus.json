        "README.md": "# agent-reviews\n\nManage GitHub PR review comments from the terminal and from AI coding agents.\n\nPR review bots (Copilot, Cursor Bugbot, CodeRabbit, etc.) leave inline comments on your pull requests. agent-reviews gives you a CLI to list, filter, reply to, and watch those comments, plus a Claude Code skill that automates the entire triage-fix-reply loop.\n\n## Why\n\n**`gh` CLI is fragile for review comments.** Agents frequently get the syntax wrong, fail to paginate, and can't reliably detect whether a comment has been replied to. agent-reviews provides a single, purpose-built interface that handles all of this correctly.\n\n**Bot reviews create a doom loop.** You fix one round of findings, push, and new comments appear. Fix those, push again, more comments. This cycle can eat hours. The included skill solves it with an integrated watcher that keeps fixing and replying until the bots go quiet.\n\n**Works in Claude Code for the web.** Most solutions rely on local tooling that isn't available in cloud environments. agent-reviews works everywhere Claude Code runs, so you can kick off a session in your browser, let it resolve all bot findings autonomously, and come back to a clean PR.\n\n## Install\n\n### CLI (npm)\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g agent-reviews\n```\n\n### Agent Skill\n\nInstalls the full automated workflow as a slash command (no npm install required).\n\n**Agent-agnostic** (works with any agent that supports [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)):\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add pbakaus/agent-reviews@agent-reviews\n```\n\n**Claude Code plugin**:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add pbakaus/agent-reviews\n/plugin install agent-reviews@agent-reviews\n```\n\nBoth register the `/agent-reviews` command. The skill bundles its own scripts, so nothing is downloaded at runtime.\n\n> You can also use both: install the CLI globally for direct terminal use, and the skill for the agent workflow.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe primary authentication method is the **GitHub CLI**. If you're logged in with `gh auth login`, agent-reviews picks up the token automatically. No configuration needed.\n\nFor environments where `gh` isn't available (like Claude Code Cloud, which routes git through an HTTPS proxy), agent-reviews falls back to:\n\n1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable\n2. `.env.local` in the repo root\n\nThe proxy environment is also why agent-reviews includes [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) `ProxyAgent` support. When `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, GitHub API requests are routed through it automatically.\n\n**Resolution order** (first match wins):\n\n1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable\n2. `.env.local` in the repo root\n3. `gh auth token` (GitHub CLI)\n\n## CLI Usage\n\n```bash\n# List all review comments on the current branch's PR\nagent-reviews\n\n# Only unresolved comments\nagent-reviews --unresolved\n\n# Only unanswered bot comments\nagent-reviews --unanswered --bots-only\n\n# Full detail for a specific comment (diff hunk + replies)\nagent-reviews --detail 12345678\n\n# Reply to a comment\nagent-reviews --reply 12345678 \"Fixed in abc1234\"\n\n# JSON output for scripting / AI agents\nagent-reviews --json\n\n# Watch for new comments (polls every 30s, exits after 10 min idle)\nagent-reviews --watch --bots-only\n\n# Target a specific PR (otherwise auto-detects from branch)\nagent-reviews --pr 42\n```\n\n### Options\n\n| Flag | Short | Description |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| `--unresolved` | `-u` | Only unresolved/pending comments |\n| `--unanswered` | `-a` | Only comments without any replies |\n| `--reply <id> \"msg\"` | `-r` | Reply to a comment |\n| `--detail <id>` | `-d` | Full detail for a comment |\n| `--pr <number>` | `-p` | Target a specific PR |\n| `--json` | `-j` | JSON output |\n| `--bots-only` | `-b` | Only bot comments |\n| `--humans-only` | `-H` | Only human comments |\n| `--expanded` | `-e` | Show full detail for each listed comment |\n| `--watch` | `-w` | Poll for new comments |\n| `--interval <sec>` | `-i` | Poll interval in seconds (default: 30) |\n| `--timeout <sec>` | | Inactivity timeout in seconds (default: 600) |\n\n## Claude Code Skill\n\nThe `/agent-reviews` skill automates the full PR review bot workflow:\n\n1. Fetch all unanswered bot comments via `npx agent-reviews --bots-only --json`\n2. Evaluate each finding (true positive, false positive, or uncertain)\n3. Fix real bugs and run lint/type-check\n4. Dismiss false positives with an explanation\n5. Reply to every comment with the outcome\n6. Watch for new comments as bots re-analyze the fixes\n7. Report a summary of all actions taken\n\n### Skill behavior\n\n- **True positives** get fixed, verified, and replied with `Fixed in {commit}`\n- **False positives** get replied with `Won't fix: {reason}`\n- **Uncertain findings** prompt the user via `AskUserQuestion`\n- All fixes are batched into a single commit before polling begins\n- Watch mode runs for up to 10 minutes, processing any new findings\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Comment types\n\nagent-reviews fetches three types of GitHub PR comments:\n\n| Type | Label | Description |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| Review comment | `CODE` | Inline comment attached to a specific line |\n| Issue comment | `COMMENT` | General PR-level comment |\n| Review | `REVIEW` | Review summary (approved, changes requested) |\n\n### Meta-comment filtering\n\nStatus updates from bots are automatically filtered out:\n\n- Vercel deployment status (`[vc]:...`)\n- Supabase branch status (`[supa]:...`)\n- Cursor Bugbot summary (\"Cursor Bugbot has reviewed your changes...\")\n\nOnly actionable findings are shown.\n\n### Reply status\n\nEach comment displays its reply status:\n\n| Status | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| `no reply` | No one has replied |\n| `replied` | A human has replied |\n| `bot replied` | Only bots have replied |\n\n### Watch mode\n\nPolls the GitHub API at a configurable interval and reports new comments as they appear. Outputs both formatted text and JSON for AI agent consumption. Exits automatically after a configurable inactivity timeout (default: 10 minutes).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How can I make the skill review human comments as well?\n\nThe skill defaults to `--bots-only` because that's the most common use case, but it's easy to change. Open your local copy of `SKILL.md` (inside `skills/agent-reviews/`) and remove the `--bots-only` flag from the commands in Steps 2, 6, and anywhere else it appears. The skill will then fetch and process all comments, regardless of author.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
