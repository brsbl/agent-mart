        "README.md": "# This plugin has moved to:\n\nhttps://github.com/tmpdir-org/tmpdir-claude-code-marketplace\n\n\n# 🔌 Claude Code Plugins\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins I use to enhance development workflows.\n\n## 📦 Available Plugins\n\n### 📝 Doc-Driven Development\n\nA documentation-driven development plugin that helps you plan and implement code\nchanges based on markdown documentation.\n\n[View Plugin Documentation](./doc-driven-development/README.md)\n\n## 🚀 Installation\n\n### From GitHub (Recommended)\n\n1. Add this marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add cbrake/claude-plugins\n```\n\n2. Install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install doc-driven-development@cbrake\n```\n\n### 🛠️ Local Development\n\nFor local plugin development and testing, create a local marketplace:\n\n```bash\n# Add local marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-plugins\n\n# Install from local marketplace\n/plugin install doc-driven-development@cbrake\n```\n\n## 🔄 Updating\n\nTo get the latest:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update cbrake\n```\n\nThis appears to update all the plugins from this marketplace.\n\n## 🏗️ Plugin Development\n\nThis repository follows the standard Claude Code plugin structure:\n\n```\nplugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata\n└── commands/\n    └── command-name.md      # Command definitions\n```\n\n### 💡 Key Concepts\n\n1. **Command definitions are markdown files** - Each `.md` file in `commands/`\n   becomes a slash command\n2. **Commands are prompts** - The markdown content is given to Claude Code when\n   invoked\n3. **Plugin metadata** - The `plugin.json` defines the plugin's identity\n\nSee [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidance.\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nTo add a new plugin to this repository:\n\n1. Create a new directory with your plugin structure\n2. Add plugin metadata in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n3. Define commands in the `commands/` directory\n4. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to include your plugin\n5. Submit a pull request\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- Claude Code CLI\n- Git (for plugins that use git-based workflows)\n\n## 📄 License\n\nMIT\n\n## 👥 Contributors\n\n- [@cbrake](https://github.com/cbrake)\n- [@jsnapoli1](https://github.com/jsnapoli1)\n\nIf you use this, please star the repo and\n[let us know](https://github.com/cbrake/claude-plugins/discussions).\n",
        "doc-driven-development/README.md": "# 📝 Doc-Driven Development\n\nA documentation-driven development plugin for Claude Code. Write your\ndocumentation first, then let Claude implement the code to match.\n\nThe goal is to embed AI in a normal development workflow, not create new\nAI-specific workflows that humans would not use (such as spec-driven\ndevelopment).\n\n![Doc-Driven Development Workflow](doc-driven-workflow.png)\n\n## 💡 Philosophy\n\nDocumentation drives code, not the reverse. Update your Markdown files to\ndescribe desired functionality, then use this plugin to generate implementation\nplans and code that match your documentation.\n\nThe byproduct of this workflow is that your documentation:\n\n- ✅ Is always fairly complete, up to date, and usable by humans.\n- ✅ Precedes coding, which helps in the design/thinking process.\n- ✅ Does not have to be done as an unpleasant afterthought.\n\n## ⚡ Commands\n\n### 📋 `/plan <description>`\n\nCreates a plan file in the `plans/` directory with the current date and your\ndescription. The command will:\n\n1. Create a new file: `plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<description>.md` (spaces replaced\n   with hyphens)\n2. Switch to plan mode\n3. Analyze current changes using `git diff`\n4. Review `README.md` and other documentation files\n5. Generate a detailed implementation plan\n6. Write the plan to the plan file\n7. Update `plans/plans.md`: mark any previous **IN PROGRESS** plan as\n   **Paused**, then add the new plan as **IN PROGRESS** with the starting commit\n   hash\n\n### 🧪 `/implement-tests`\n\nImplements tests for the **IN PROGRESS** plan using Test-Driven Development\n(TDD), creating logical git commits for each test unit. The command:\n\n1. Finds the **IN PROGRESS** plan from `plans/plans.md`\n2. Breaks tests into logical units (by function, component, test suite)\n3. For each unit: writes tests, commits using `test:` prefix, and records the\n   commit hash in the plan file's `## Commits` section\n4. Keeps the plan status as **IN PROGRESS** (tests alone don't complete a plan)\n\nUse this command when you want to follow a strict TDD workflow where tests are\nwritten first based on the documented requirements.\n\n### 🎯 `/execute`\n\nFinds and executes inline instructions or pseudo code marked with special tags\nin your code or documentation. This enables surgical, targeted changes without\nneeding full documentation rewrites.\n\nThe command looks for instruction markers in these formats:\n\n- `@CLAUDE: <instruction>` - Single line instruction\n- `@CLAUDE-START` / `@CLAUDE-END` - Multiline instruction blocks\n- In code comments: `// @CLAUDE:`, `# @CLAUDE:`, `/* @CLAUDE: */`,\n  `<!-- @CLAUDE: -->`\n- In Markdown: Lines starting with `> @CLAUDE:` or within code blocks\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Searches uncommitted changes (from `git diff`) for instruction markers.\n2. Executes each instruction or pseudo code as described.\n3. Removes the marker tags after successful completion.\n4. Updates any uncommitted plan files to reflect what was done.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\nAdd an instruction marker in your code:\n\n```python\n# @CLAUDE: Add error handling for network timeouts\ndef fetch_data(url):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    return response.json()\n```\n\nRun `/execute` to implement the instruction and remove the marker.\n\nUse this command for quick, focused changes like adding error handling,\nrefactoring specific functions, or implementing small improvements.\n\n### 🔨 `/implement`\n\nImplements code changes for the **IN PROGRESS** plan, creating logical git\ncommits for each unit of work. The command:\n\n1. Finds the **IN PROGRESS** plan from `plans/plans.md`\n2. Breaks the implementation into logical units (by function, component, task)\n3. For each unit: implements, commits using conventional commit format, and\n   records the commit hash in the plan file's `## Commits` section\n4. Updates the plan status to `Implemented`\n\nConventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`\n\n### 📄 `/update-docs`\n\nUpdates documentation to reflect code changes detected by `git diff`. This is\nthe inverse of `/implement` - use it when you've written code and need to update\nyour documentation to match.\n\nThe command also updates the **IN PROGRESS** plan (from `plans/plans.md`) with\nimplementation details and technical decisions.\n\n### 🏷️ `/release [version]`\n\nAutomates the release process by:\n\n- Converting the `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` to a versioned release\n  with the current date\n- Updating version numbers in all manifest files (e.g.,\n  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)\n- Creating a git tag for the release\n\n**Usage:**\n\n- `/release` - Auto-increments the patch version (e.g., 1.0.6 → 1.0.7)\n- `/release 2.0.0` - Uses the specified version number\n\nThe command does not automatically commit or push changes, allowing you to\nreview before finalizing.\n\n### 🔍 `/review`\n\nPerforms comprehensive code review on uncommitted changes using specialized\nagents. The command launches multiple parallel agents to review:\n\n- **Formatting**: Checks code formatting consistency against `FORMAT.md`\n  (auto-creates if missing).\n- **Architecture**: Verifies code follows documented architectural decisions.\n- **Documentation**: Ensures README, CHANGELOG, and plan files match code.\n- **Potential Bugs**: Identifies bugs, edge cases, and security concerns.\n- **Code Clarity**: Evaluates code design with advocate/critic perspectives.\n- **Comments**: Reviews comment quality and usefulness.\n\nResults are appended to the **IN PROGRESS** plan file under a\n`## Review (<date>)` heading. After the review, the command prompts for:\n\n1. **Commit decision**: Auto-commit, manual, or skip\n2. **Completion decision**: Mark plan as Completed or continue iterating\n\n### 🔁 `/cycle`\n\nRuns the complete TDD implementation cycle in one command:\n\n1. `/implement-tests` - Write tests first\n2. `/implement` - Implement code to pass the tests\n3. `/update-docs` - Update documentation\n4. `/review` - Perform code review\n\nUse this when you want to execute the full workflow without running each command\nindividually.\n\n### ⏭️ `/skip`\n\nTells Claude to skip the current edit or command and continue with the next\ntask. Useful when you want to bypass a suggested change.\n\n## 🔄 Workflow\n\nThe typical doc-driven workflow:\n\n1. **📝 Update documentation** - Describe desired functionality in Markdown\n   files.\n2. **📋 Create a plan** - Run `/plan <feature-name>`.\n3. **👀 Inspect plan**.\n4. **🔁 Run the cycle** - Run `/cycle` to execute the full TDD workflow (tests →\n   implement → update-docs → review).\n   - _Alternative_: Run each step individually with `/implement-tests`,\n     `/implement`, `/update-docs`, and `/review`.\n   - _Alternative_: For quick, targeted changes, add `@CLAUDE:` markers in code\n     and run `/execute` instead.\n5. **🏷️ Release** - Run `/release` to create a versioned release with updated\n   changelog and git tag.\n\n## 🚀 Installation\n\nSee the [main repository README](https://github.com/cbrake/claude-plugins) for\ninstallation instructions.\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- Git repository (the plugin uses `git diff` to detect documentation and code\n  changes).\n- `plans/` directory in your project (created automatically by the plugin).\n- `plans/plans.md` file for tracking plan status (created automatically by\n  `/plan`).\n\n## 📚 Examples\n\n### Example 1: Adding a New Feature\n\n1. Update your `README.md` to describe the new feature:\n\n```markdown\n## Authentication\n\nUsers can log in using email/password or OAuth providers (Google, GitHub).\nSessions last 7 days by default.\n```\n\n2. Create a plan:\n\n```bash\n/plan authentication-system\n```\n\nInspect plan.\n\n3. Implement the plan:\n\n```bash\n/implement\n```\n\n### Example 2: Refactoring\n\n1. Update documentation to reflect new architecture.\n2. Create a plan: `/plan api-refactor`.\n3. Review the plan file in `plans/`.\n4. Run `/implement` when ready.\n\n### Example 3: Test-Driven Development\n\n1. Update your `README.md` to describe a new feature:\n\n```markdown\n## Payment Processing\n\nThe system supports credit card payments via Stripe. Users can save multiple\npayment methods and set a default. All transactions are logged for audit\npurposes.\n```\n\n2. Create a plan:\n\n```bash\n/plan payment-processing\n```\n\nInspect plan.\n\n3. Implement tests first:\n\n```bash\n/implement-tests\n```\n\nInspect tests.\n\n4. Run tests to verify they fail (red phase).\n\n5. Implement the code:\n\n```bash\n/implement\n```\n\n6. Run tests to verify they pass (green phase).\n\n7. Update the docs to accurately reflect implementation:\n\n```bash\n/update-docs\n```\n\n## 📊 Plan Status Lifecycle\n\nPlans in `plans/plans.md` are tracked with three columns:\n\n```markdown\n| Plan                  | Status          | Started At |\n| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |\n| 2026-01-17-feature.md | **IN PROGRESS** | abc1234    |\n```\n\nThe \"Started At\" column records the commit hash when the plan was created.\n\n### Valid Statuses\n\n- **IN PROGRESS** - The currently active plan being worked on (only one at a\n  time)\n- **Paused** - A plan that was interrupted when a new plan started (can be\n  resumed)\n- **Completed** - A plan that has been fully implemented and reviewed\n\n### Status Transitions\n\n| Action                            | Effect                                                  |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `/plan` with existing IN PROGRESS | Old plan → **Paused**, new plan → **IN PROGRESS**       |\n| `/review` → user marks complete   | Current plan → Completed                                |\n| Manual edit to plans.md           | Resume a **Paused** plan by changing to **IN PROGRESS** |\n\n### Commit Tracking\n\nIndividual plan files track implementation commits in a `## Commits` section:\n\n```markdown\n## Commits\n\n| Hash    | Description                     |\n| ------- | ------------------------------- |\n| abc1234 | feat: add authentication module |\n| def5678 | test: add authentication tests  |\n```\n\n`/implement` and `/implement-tests` automatically create granular commits and\nrecord them in the plan file.\n\n### Review Integration\n\nThe `/review` command appends all review findings directly to the **IN\nPROGRESS** plan file under a `## Review (<date>)` section. This keeps all\ninformation about a feature in one place - no need to cross-reference separate\nreview files.\n\n## 💡 Tips\n\n- Don't commit documentation or code changes until the feature is complete. The\n  commands use `git diff` to see what is new in the documentation and code.\n- Use `/skip` if Claude suggests a change you don't want.\n- Review plan files before implementing - they're just Markdown files you can\n  edit.\n- Review tests before implementing code.\n- The `plans/` directory serves as a history of your implementation decisions.\n\n## 🌟 Similar projects\n\n- https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor\n- https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin\n"
