        "README.md": "# rails-ai 🚂\n\n> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL:** Under active development. APIs and architecture may change. Phase 2 of 4.\n\nRails domain expertise for Claude Code. Built on [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) workflows.\n\n## The Vision\n\nBuild Rails apps so autonomously they leave today's Next.js and React generators in the dust. We're not playing catch-up—we're setting the pace and showing what LLM-driven development really looks like when Rails is in the driver's seat.\n\n## The Problem\n\nRight now, LLMs excel at Next.js and Node code. Ask them to build a Rails app and you get... okay results. Ask for a Next.js app and you get production-ready code.\n\n**Why?** Training data. JavaScript/TypeScript dominates the training sets. Rails, despite being more mature and productive, is underrepresented.\n\n**The irony?** Rails is actually better suited for AI code generation:\n\n- **Convention over Configuration** — Less decision-making, more consistent patterns\n- **Strong opinions** — Clear right/wrong answers\n- **Battle-tested** — 20+ years of best practices\n- **Monolithic by default** — Simpler mental model\n- **Solid Stack** — Rails 8's batteries-included approach\n\nRails was built to make developers productive by removing decisions. That same philosophy makes it perfect for LLMs — fewer choices, more consistency, clearer patterns.\n\n## What It Does\n\nAdds Rails-specific skills to Claude Code: ActiveRecord patterns, Hotwire, Minitest/TDD, security, Solid Stack (Rails 8), and 20+ team conventions.\n\nThe `/rails-ai:architect` command loads Superpowers workflows (process) and Rails-AI skills (domain knowledge), then coordinates general-purpose agents to build features end-to-end.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install Superpowers (required)\nclaude\n/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers\n/plugin install superpowers\n\n# 2. Install rails-ai\n/plugin marketplace add zerobearing2/rails-ai\n/plugin install rails-ai\n```\n\n### Local Development Install\n\nTo contribute or test changes locally:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/zerobearing2/rails-ai.git\ncd rails-ai\n\n# 2. Install Superpowers (required dependency)\nclaude\n/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers\n/plugin install superpowers\n\n# 3. Add local directory as a marketplace and install\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/rails-ai\n/plugin install rails-ai@rails-ai\n\n# 4. Restart Claude Code to load the plugin\n```\n\n**Verify installation:**\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n# Opens plugin management interface - verify rails-ai is listed\n```\n\n**Run tests before submitting changes:**\n\n```bash\nbin/ci\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n/rails-ai:architect add user authentication\n/rails-ai:architect debug failing test\n/rails-ai:architect refactor UserController\n```\n\n**Local Development Note:** If you're developing rails-ai locally (installed from a local directory), SessionStart hooks don't execute due to a [Claude Code limitation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11939). Manually use the skill once per session:\n\n```text\nUse the skill: using-rails-ai\n```\n\nThis uses the full protocol including Superpowers integration and skill-loading enforcement. Not needed when installed from GitHub.\n\n## Architecture\n\n**Two-layer system:**\n\n- **Superpowers** = HOW to work (brainstorming, planning, TDD, debugging, code review)\n- **Rails-AI** = WHAT you're building (12 Rails domain skills + team rules)\n\nThe `/rails-ai:architect` slash command loads both layers, then dispatches general-purpose agents as workers to implement features.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nOpinionated Rails development:\n- 37signals philosophy (simple, pragmatic)\n- Rails conventions (REST-only)\n- Solid Stack (SolidQueue, SolidCache, SolidCable)\n- Minitest, not RSpec\n- TDD always\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe're turning that gap into a roadmap instead of a wish list.\n\n**Phase 1 — Architect Coordinator** ✅ Complete\nClean architecture with `/rails-ai:architect` slash command that coordinates development: loads Superpowers workflows (HOW) and Rails-AI skills (WHAT), then dispatches general-purpose workers to implement. No complexity, clear separation between coordination and execution.\n\n**Phase 2 — Domain Skills & Team Rules** 🚧 Current\n12 focused domain skills, 20+ team conventions, and custom RuboCop cops. Every decision backed by Rails best practices in reusable, testable modules.\n\n**Phase 3 — Memory & Context** 🔬 Next\nIndex thousands of production Rails patterns, wire them into local memory + knowledge graph, and retrieve the right snippet at the right time with RAG + SQLite vector search.\n\n**Phase 4 — Fully Autonomous Rails** 🚀 Goal\nShip end-to-end features—auth, payments, background jobs, admin, APIs—complete with tests and security. Target: 85%+ first-pass success rate.\n\n**What already works:**\n- `/rails-ai:architect` coordinates features end-to-end (planning → worker dispatch → review)\n- 12 domain skills cover models, controllers, views, Hotwire, security, testing, and more\n- Superpowers workflows provide battle-tested TDD, debugging, and code review\n- 20+ team rules enforce Rails conventions automatically\n- Clean separation: coordinator loads skills, workers implement features\n\n**What we're building next:**\n- Phase 3 RAG pipeline with SQLite vector search\n- Library of thousands of indexed production Rails patterns\n- 30–50% accuracy gains from better retrieval and context\n- Path to 85%+ first-try pass rates and autonomous feature delivery\n\n## Join Us\n\nThis is bigger than a plugin. We're proving Rails can lead in the AI era.\n\n**If you're a Rails developer:** Try the architect. Break it. Tell us what's missing. Your real-world usage drives what we build.\n\n**If you're into AI/ML:** We need help with Phase 3 (RAG) and Phase 4 (autonomous delivery). Indexing Rails codebases, building evaluation frameworks, improving retrieval quality.\n\n**If you care about Rails:** Star the repo. Spread the word. Rails deserves world-class AI tooling. Help us build it.\n\nThe goal isn't just good—it's to make Rails the obvious choice for AI-assisted development. Help us get there.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).\n\n## Credits\n\nBuilt on [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by [@obra](https://github.com/obra).\n\nPlanning approach inspired by [Specification Pyramid](https://signalthinking.com/p/why-your-prd-isnt-working-for-ai-083) by [Robert Evans](https://github.com/revans).\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n"
