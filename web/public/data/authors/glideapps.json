Use at your own risk.**\n\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"media/logo-light.png\">\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"media/logo-dark.png\">\n  <img src=\"media/logo-light.png\" alt=\"Glide Code\" width=\"600\" height=\"auto\">\n</picture>\n\n## What?\n\nGlide Code is a plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com), which gives the world's most popular coding agent the ability to not only build apps and work in Glide, but to do so with many agents in parallel via browser automation and Glide's multiplayer support.\n\nThis is a much more powerful (but slower) version of the built-in Agent in Glide today. It's more powerful because it can do everything in the builder, but it's also a general-purpose agent which can do things like analyze files and use the Glide API.\n\nClip from a 4hr session where Glide Code built 3 apps (sped up 40x):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"media/demo.gif\" alt=\"Glide Code Demo\" width=\"800\">\n</p>\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, [install Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com) if you don't have it.\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add glideapps/glide-code\n/plugin install glide@glide\n```\n\n## How to Use\n\nRun the `/glide` command with what you want to build or work on:\n\n```\n/glide Build an app for managing repairs for our construction company. The data is in repairs.csv\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window where you can sign in to Glide (first time only). Your session will be remembered for future use. Claude will use the appropriate agents to build your app.\n\nYou can also kick off a working session with an existing app:\n\n```\n/glide do a design review on my Repairs app\n```\n\n**Working on multiple apps:** You can work on many apps at the same time, but you should work on them in separate directories with separate instances of [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com).\n\n## Development\n\n### Running Scripts\n\n| Script | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|\n| `./scripts/start` | Run plugin from installed/cloned repo (from any directory) |\n| `./scripts/dev` | Run plugin for local development (run from repo root) |\n\nWhen working on the plugin itself, use `scripts/dev` from the repository root. This loads the plugin from the current directory, so changes to agents, skills, and commands are reflected immediately.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:glideapps/glide-code.git\ncd glide-code\n./scripts/dev\n```\n\nAlternatively, point [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com) to the local directory:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/glide-code/glide\n```\n\n## Build Workflow\n\n1. **Clarify use case** - Understand what you want to build\n2. **Create app** - Start a blank app in Glide Builder\n3. **Analyze file** (if provided) - Extract data structure from spreadsheets\n4. **Create tables via API** - Import data using the Glide API\n5. **Build screens** - Design the UI with Playwright automation\n6. **Design review** - Critique and improve screen layouts\n7. **QA verification** - Verify features actually work\n8. **Finalize** - Configure access and publish\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/glide` | Guided setup - interactive login, choose app, select task |\n| `/tip` | Provide expert guidance - plugin learns and updates skills |\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| **build** | Creates apps and builds screens via browser automation |\n| **data** | Creates tables and imports data via Glide API |\n| **file-analysis** | Analyzes spreadsheets to extract data models |\n| **design-review** | Critiques screens for design quality on mobile/desktop |\n| **qa** | Verifies features work before declaring the app ready |\n| **app-research** | Explores existing apps to document structure |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| **glide** | Main workflow, agent coordination, builder navigation |\n| **design** | Screen structure, component selection, layout patterns |\n| **templates** | Browse Template Store for design inspiration |\n| **data-modeling** | Tables, columns, relationships |\n| **computed-columns** | Math, If-Then-Else, Relations, Rollups |\n| **ai** | AI columns (Generate Text, Audio to Text, etc.) |\n| **api** | Glide API v2 usage |\n| **app-sharing** | Privacy settings and authentication |\n| **browser** | Multi-browser coordination for parallel work |\n\n## Concurrent Operations\n\nThe plugin supports up to 6 parallel browser sessions, enabling multiple agents to work simultaneously on the same app. Glide is multiplayer-enabled, so concurrent edits work seamlessly.\n\n**Use cases:**\n- Build multiple screens in parallel\n- Design review while building continues\n- QA verification alongside fixes\n",
        "glide/README.md": "# Glide Plugin\n\nBuild complete apps in Glide Builder (go.glideapps.com) using Claude Code with browser automation and API integration.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Browser Automation**: Navigate and interact with the Glide Builder UI using Playwright\n- **API Integration**: Efficient data operations using the Glide API v2\n- **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Skills covering workflow, data modeling, layout, and more\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. **Glide Account**: You must be able to sign in to go.glideapps.com\n2. **API Token** (optional): For direct data operations via the Glide API (Big Tables only)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: From GitHub Repository\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-repo glideapps/glide-code\n```\n\n### Option 2: From Local Directory\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/glide\n```\n\n### Option 3: Copy to Project\nCopy the `glide` directory to your project's `.claude/plugins/` directory and Claude Code will auto-discover it.\n\n## Browser Setup\n\nThis plugin includes a Playwright MCP server that opens a browser window you can watch. The browser uses a **persistent profile** so you only need to sign in to Glide once.\n\n### First Time Setup\n\n1. Start Claude Code with the plugin\n2. Ask Claude to build a Glide app - a browser window will open\n3. When prompted, sign in to Glide in the browser window\n4. After signing in, tell Claude you're ready to continue\n\nYour login will be remembered for future sessions.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/glide` | Build apps - guided setup, choose new/existing app, store API key, begin building |\n| `/ask` | Expert advisor - ask about viability, features, get data/screen/workflow plans |\n| `/explain-feature` | Deep dive into specific Glide features - computed columns, workflows, components, etc. |\n| `/tip` | Provide expert guidance when stuck - plugin learns and updates its skills |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `glide` | **Read first!** Overall workflow, agent coordination, browser automation |\n| `data-modeling` | Tables, columns, Big Tables, data structure |\n| `computed-columns` | Math, If-Then-Else, Relations, Rollups, Lookups |\n| `layout` | Screens, UI components, forms, actions |\n| `ai` | AI columns, summaries, auto-categorization, document scanning |\n| `api` | Using Glide API v2 for data operations |\n| `app-sharing` | Privacy settings, authentication, publishing, user access |\n| `workflows` | Automation, triggers, loops, conditions, API integrations |\n| `explain-feature` | Deep dive explanations of specific Glide features with examples and best practices |\n| `learnings-log` | Historical record of expert tips integrated into plugin skills |\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `build` | Browser automation - creates apps, adds screens, configures UI |\n| `file-analysis` | Analyzes spreadsheets to create app specifications |\n| `data` | API operations - creates tables, imports data |\n| `design` | Reviews screens and suggests improvements |\n| `qa` | Verifies features actually work before declaring app ready |\n| `app-research` | Explores existing apps to document structure and features |\n| `skill-learner` | Extracts learnings from tips and updates skills (auto-invoked by `/tip`) |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Using the /start Command\n\nRun `/start` to get started. This guided workflow will:\n1. Guide you through interactive login to Glide in the browser\n2. Ask if you want to create a new app or edit an existing one\n3. If editing, prompt for the app URL or name\n4. Let you choose what to do: build UI, analyze files, review design, etc.\n5. Launch the appropriate agent to complete your task\n\nYour authentication is stored locally in `.glide/` and excluded from version control. The API key is requested only when actually creating tables in an app.\n\n### Building Apps Directly\n1. Start Claude Code with the plugin\n2. Ask Claude to build your app: \"Build a task management app in Glide\"\n3. A browser window opens - sign in to Glide if prompted (first time only)\n4. Watch the agent build your app in real-time\n\n### Data Operations\n1. Get API token: Data Editor > Show API > Copy secret token (or use `/start` to set it up)\n2. Ask Claude: \"Import this CSV into my Glide Big Table\"\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Column-Based Calculations\nAll calculations in Glide are built by creating computed columns that build on each other, not cell formulas. Chain columns together for complex calculations.\n\n### AI Columns\nGlide has powerful AI columns that run inference on your data:\n- **Generate Text** - Create summaries, descriptions, recommendations\n- **Image to Text** - Extract info from photos (receipts, documents, products)\n- **Text to Choice** - Auto-categorize and classify content\n\n### Big Tables vs Native Tables\n- **Native Tables**: Per-app, can't be shared\n- **Big Tables**: Team-level, can be shared across apps, required for API access\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Data first, then screens** - create tables before building the UI\n- **Screen = Table + Collection + Details** - each screen is backed by a table\n- **Calculations are columns** - add computed columns, not cell formulas\n- **Do not use the Agent tab** - there's an \"Agent\" tab in Glide Builder, but it's error-prone. Build manually with Data/Layout tabs instead\n- Visibility conditions are NOT security - use Row Owners for data protection\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Glide Documentation](https://www.glideapps.com/docs)\n- [Glide API Reference](https://apidocs.glideapps.com/api-reference/v2/general/introduction)\n"
