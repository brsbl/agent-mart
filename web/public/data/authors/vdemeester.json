        "plugins/git-commit/README.md": "# Git Commit Plugin\n\nCreate thoughtful, well-formatted commit messages with systematic file review and optional push functionality.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis plugin enhances Claude Code's native git workflow by adding:\n- **Systematic file review** to ensure commit coherence\n- **\"Why\"-focused messaging** that explains impact and reasoning\n- **Conventional commits** for better project history\n- **Guided workflow** with clear phases and confirmations\n\n## Features\n\n- ✅ **Parallel git operations** - Fast information gathering using multiple tool calls\n- ✅ **File-by-file review** - Understand each file's changes and ensure they're related\n- ✅ **\"Why\" over \"what\"** - Commit messages focus on impact and reasoning, not just changes\n- ✅ **Conventional commits** - Uses feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, style, ci\n- ✅ **Claude Code attribution** - Automatically includes proper co-authorship\n- ✅ **Smart push** - Offers to push only when NOT on main/master\n- ✅ **TodoWrite integration** - Track progress through phases\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n/git-commit:commit\n/git-commit:commit-no-claude\n```\n\n## Workflow Phases\n\n### 1. Gather Repository Information\nRuns git status, diff, and log **in parallel** for fast analysis.\n\n### 2. Review Files Individually\nReviews each changed file's diff and ensures all changes belong together.\n\n### 3. Create Commit Message\nDrafts a concise message focusing on **why** changes were made and their impact.\n\nFormat:\n```\n<type>: <title under 80 chars>\n\n- <impact/reason bullet under 80 chars>\n- <impact/reason bullet under 80 chars>\n- <impact/reason bullet under 80 chars>\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\n### 4. Execute Commit\nCreates the commit after user approval, staging files as needed.\n\n### 5. Optional Push\nOffers to push (only when not on main/master branch).\n\n## Example Messages\n\n### Good (focuses on \"why\")\n```\nfeat: Implement user authentication\n\n- Enable secure multi-user sessions with JWT\n- Prevent unauthorized access to protected routes\n- Lay groundwork for role-based access control\n```\n\n### Bad (focuses on \"what\")\n```\nfeat: Add auth\n\n- Added login.ts file\n- Added middleware\n- Added tests\n```\n\n## Conventional Commit Types\n\n- **feat**: New feature or capability\n- **fix**: Bug fix\n- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates\n- **docs**: Documentation changes\n- **refactor**: Code restructuring without behavior change\n- **test**: Adding or updating tests\n- **perf**: Performance improvements\n- **style**: Code formatting, whitespace\n- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes\n\n## Why This Plugin?\n\nClaude Code already has excellent git support, but this plugin adds value by:\n\n1. **Enforcing systematic review** - Reviews each file individually to ensure coherent commits\n2. **Teaching better commit messages** - Guides towards \"why\" over \"what\"\n3. **Conventional commits** - Maintains consistent commit history\n4. **Safety gates** - Multiple confirmations before committing\n5. **Smart defaults** - Knows when to offer push and when not to\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **One concern per commit** - If files address different concerns, split into multiple commits\n- **Focus on impact** - Explain why changes matter, not just what changed\n- **Keep it concise** - Respect 80-character limits\n- **Use conventional types** - Helps with changelog generation\n\n## Configuration\n\nNo configuration needed. Works with your existing git setup.\n\n## Safety Features\n\n- ✅ Only commits when user explicitly confirms\n- ✅ Won't auto-push to main/master branches\n- ✅ Reviews all files before committing\n- ✅ Graceful error handling\n- ✅ Follows Claude Code's git safety protocols\n\n## Performance\n\nUses parallel tool calls to gather git information efficiently, reducing token usage and latency.\n\n## Author\n\nChmouel - <chmouel@chmouel.com>\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n",
        "plugins/weekly-review/README.md": "# Weekly Review Plugin\n\nA Claude Code plugin that generates comprehensive weekly summaries of your work, prioritizing GitHub PRs and automatically categorizing into tech debt, bug fixes, and new features.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe weekly review plugin analyzes your work from the past week (or custom time range), **prioritizing merged GitHub PRs** when available and falling back to git commits, and provides:\n\n- A concise summary of your accomplishments (PRs or commits)\n- 2-5 bullet points highlighting major changes\n- Categorization of work into tech debt, bug fixes, and new functionality\n- Statistics on PRs merged, commits made, files changed, and lines modified\n- A detailed analysis paragraph explaining each category\n- Links to merged PRs (when using GitHub mode) for easy reference\n\n## Design Principles\n\nThis plugin follows the [Claude Code Plugin Design Guide](../CLAUDE.md):\n\n- **Read-only**: Never modifies your code or git history\n- **Transparent**: Clear multi-phase workflow with progress tracking\n- **Safe**: Graceful error handling with helpful error messages\n- **Actionable**: Provides concrete insights and next steps\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\n/weekly-review:weekly-review\n```\n\nThis will analyze your commits from the past 7 days.\n\n### Custom Time Range\n\n```bash\n/weekly-review:weekly-review 10\n```\n\nThis will analyze your commits from the past 10 days (maximum).\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Phase 1: Setup & Environment Check\n- Checks if GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available and authenticated\n- Verifies your git email configuration\n- Determines which mode to use (GitHub PRs preferred, git commits fallback)\n- Validates the repository state\n\n### Phase 2: Data Collection\n\n**GitHub PR Mode (Preferred)**:\n- Lists all merged PRs authored by you using `gh pr list`\n- Collects PR metadata: title, labels, description, URLs\n- Gathers file changes and commit counts for each PR\n- Filters to the specified date range\n\n**Git Commits Mode (Fallback)**:\n- Gathers all commits by your email address\n- Collects diff statistics for each commit\n- Filters out merge commits\n\n### Phase 3: Work Analysis\n\n**For GitHub PRs**:\n- Categorizes using PR labels and keywords in title/description\n- Extracts themes from PR descriptions\n- Calculates statistics across all merged PRs\n\n**For Git Commits**:\n- Categorizes using commit message keywords\n- Identifies patterns and themes\n- Calculates statistics and distributions\n\n### Phase 4: Report Generation\n- Produces a structured markdown report\n- Highlights key accomplishments (2-5 bullet points)\n- Provides breakdown by work type with percentages\n- Lists merged PRs with links (GitHub mode) or commit timeline (git mode)\n- Suggests next steps\n\n## Categorization Logic\n\nThe plugin uses intelligent heuristics to categorize your work:\n\n### GitHub PR Mode\nUses PR labels and keywords in title/description:\n\n**Tech Debt**:\n- Labels: `refactor`, `tech-debt`, `cleanup`, `chore`\n- Keywords: refactor, cleanup, improve, optimize, simplify, dependency update\n- Code quality improvements and migrations\n\n**Bug Fixes**:\n- Labels: `bug`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `bugfix`\n- Keywords: fix, bug, issue, patch, resolve, crash, error\n- Issue references (Fixes #123, Closes #456)\n\n**New Functionality**:\n- Labels: `feature`, `enhancement`, `new`\n- Keywords: add, feature, implement, new, create, introduce\n- Breaking changes and API additions\n\n### Git Commits Mode\nUses commit message keywords:\n\n**Tech Debt**:\n- Keywords: refactor, cleanup, improve, optimize, simplify, chore\n- Code reorganization and dependency updates\n- Formatting and linting changes\n\n**Bug Fixes**:\n- Keywords: fix, bug, issue, patch, resolve\n- Error handling improvements\n- Test additions and modifications\n\n**New Functionality**:\n- Keywords: add, feature, feat, implement, new, create\n- New files and substantial code additions\n- API changes and extensions\n\n## Example Output\n\n### GitHub PR Mode\n\n```markdown\n# Weekly Review (2025-10-24 to
