        "README.md": "# Claude Code Plugins Marketplace\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace covering orchestration, release automation, design review, Home Assistant development, Linux system administration, GitHub repository management, and plugin testing.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this marketplace to your Claude Code installation:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n```\n\nOr using the full URL:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins.git\n```\n\nThen install individual plugins:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install agent-orchestrator@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\n### Staying Up to Date\n\n**Auto-update** keeps plugins current automatically. To verify it's enabled:\n\n1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code\n2. Go to the **Marketplaces** tab\n3. Select **l3digitalnet-plugins**\n4. Look for **Disable auto-update** (meaning it's already on)\n\nWhen auto-update is enabled, Claude Code refreshes the marketplace catalog and updates\ninstalled plugins at the start of each session.\n\n**Manual update** if you prefer to control when updates happen:\n\n```bash\n# Refresh the marketplace catalog\n/plugin marketplace update l3digitalnet-plugins\n\n# Then update individual plugins via /plugin → Installed tab → Update now\n```\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Type | Command | Description |\n|--------|------|---------|-------------|\n| [Agent Orchestrator](#agent-orchestrator) | Commands + Hooks | `/orchestrate` | Delegates complex tasks to agent teams with context management |\n| [Design Assistant](#design-assistant) | Commands + Skills | `/design-draft`, `/design-review` | Guided design document authoring and principle-enforced review |\n| [GitHub Repo Manager](#github-repo-manager) | Commands + Skills | `/repo-manager` | Conversational GitHub repo health assessment and maintenance |\n| [Home Assistant Dev](#home-assistant-dev) | Commands + Skills + MCP | varies | Full HA integration development toolkit with 27 skills |\n| [Linux SysAdmin MCP](#linux-sysadmin-mcp) | MCP | ~100 tools | Linux system administration across 15 modules |\n| [Plugin Test Harness](#plugin-test-harness) | MCP | 18 tools | Iterative test/fix/reload loop for plugin development |\n| [Release Pipeline](#release-pipeline) | Commands + Skills | `/release` | Semver releases with pre-flight checks and changelog generation |\n\n## Principles\n\nThese principles apply across all plugins in this collection. Individual plugins may define additional principles scoped to their domain.\n\n**[P1] Act on Intent** — Invoking a command is consent. Execute on clear intent without restating what's about to happen or asking for confirmation of the obvious. Confirmation gates exist only for operations that are truly irreversible and whose scope materially exceeds what the invocation implies — not for operations that are merely large or look dangerous. Routine friction is a tax, not a safeguard.\n\n**[P2] Scope Fidelity** — Execute the full scope of what was asked — completely, without hedging or stopping to confirm sub-tasks. Do not act beyond the declared scope; surface out-of-scope observations as notes only. Scope creep in either direction is a failure.\n\n**[P3] Inform at Pause Points, Not Every Step** — Succeed quietly: output results, not narration; lead with findings, not intent. At logical pause points — phase transitions, pre-decision moments — surface a compact summary; at the natural conclusion of a process, a brief factual record of what was done — not why, just what changed. Timely, dense information enables decisions; status updates after every action are noise. When something fails, stop immediately and surface the complete failure — raw output included, nothing softened, no autonomous recovery. The user should never need to guess whether an operation succeeded.\n\n**[P4] Use the Full Toolkit** — When interaction is required, use Claude Code's rich primitives: bounded `AskUserQuestion` choices over open-ended prompts, markdown previews for side-by-side comparisons, multi-select for non-exclusive options. Lead with findings, not preamble. Format with purpose — status symbols, structured lists — never decoratively.\n\n**[P5] Convergence is the Contract** — Iterative work defines completion as a measurable state — zero findings, all checks green, all tests passing — and drives toward it across cycles without check-ins. Report the trend; stop only when the criterion is met or the user intervenes.\n\n**[P6] Composable, Focused Units** — Every plugin component — command, skill, hook — does one thing and is independently useful. Complex workflows emerge from combining atomic units at runtime; orchestration is assembled from the outside, not baked in. Skills are the sharpest expression of this: each covers a single concept narrow enough that its trigger fits in one sentence without \"or\". Skills load in full when triggered; wide scope silently taxes every loosely related task with tokens that do no work. If a trigger requires \"or\", it's two skills.\n\n---\n\n### Agent Orchestrator\n\n**General-purpose agent team orchestration** with automatic context management, file\nisolation via git worktrees,

        "plugins/agent-orchestrator/README.md": "# Agent Orchestrator\n\nGeneral-purpose agent team orchestration for Claude Code. Decomposes complex tasks into parallel workstreams with automatic context management, file isolation via git worktrees, and mechanical enforcement hooks.\n\n## Summary\n\nAgent Orchestrator addresses Claude Code's core limitation on complex multi-file tasks: context degradation. It spawns isolated teammate agents in separate git worktrees — each with a clean context window — and coordinates them through a shared task ledger. The lead agent handles planning and synthesis only; teammates handle all implementation work. The result is higher-quality output on tasks that would otherwise exhaust a single session's context window.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Triage Before Orchestration** — Never spin up a team for a task a single agent can handle. The overhead of orchestration must be earned by task complexity, not habit.\n\n**[P2] The Lead Never Implements** — The lead orchestrator decomposes, delegates, and synthesises. It never writes or edits files directly; all implementation work is owned by teammates.\n\n**[P3] File Ownership is Exclusive** — No two teammates ever edit the same file. Concurrent writes are prevented through structural assignment in the task ledger, not by trusting instruction alone.\n\n**[P4] Disposable Context, Durable Artifacts** — Subagent and teammate context windows are throwaway; only their outputs matter. Large exploration tasks run in disposable context to keep the lead window clean for synthesis.\n\n**[P5] Mechanical Enforcement Over Instruction** — Critical constraints (lead write guard, read counter, compaction safety) are enforced by hooks that fire deterministically, not by asking the lead to remember rules under pressure.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install agent-orchestrator@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\nOr test locally:\n```\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/agent-orchestrator\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `/orchestrate` and describe your task. For simple tasks (single file, clear scope), the triage gate skips orchestration and you proceed normally.\n\nFor complex tasks, the orchestrator will:\n\n1. **Plan** — scan the codebase, decompose work into parallel workstreams, present a plan for approval\n2. **Execute** — bootstrap worktree infrastructure, spawn teammates in waves, monitor health\n3. **Synthesize** — merge worktrees, run integration checks, report results\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/orchestrate` | Decompose and delegate a complex task to an agent team |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `orchestration-context` | Compaction and handoff rules for lead/teammates/subagents |\n| `orchestration-execution` | Wave-based parallel execution and teammate health monitoring |\n| `orchestration-state` | Single-writer ledger, worktree paths, and structured return templates |\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `integration-checker` | Read-only + test execution agent for verifying merged teammate outputs |\n| `conflict-resolver` | Scoped single-file agent for resolving git merge conflicts during synthesis |\n\n## Hooks\n\nAll hooks register declaratively via `hooks/hooks.json` — no runtime setup needed.\n\n| Hook | Event | What it does |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| **Compaction safety** | PreCompact | Logs event to `compaction-events.log`, prompts agent to write a handoff note |\n| **Lead write guard** | PreToolUse (Write\\|Edit\\|MultiEdit) | Blocks source file writes when `ORCHESTRATOR_LEAD=1` is set; teammates are unaffected |\n| **Read counter** | PostToolUse (Read\\|View) | Warns at 10 file reads, critical alert at 15 |\n\n## Context Management Strategy\n\nThree-layer defense against context degradation:\n\n1. **Structural** — disposable subagents for exploration, teammates for implementation, lead for coordination only\n2. **Persistent** — handoff notes on disk survive compaction, ledger tracks all decisions\n3. **Mechanical** — hooks warn on excessive reads, block unauthorized writes, log compaction events\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n- **Single-writer ledger:** Only the lead writes to `ledger.md`. Teammates write to individual status files. Prevents concurrent write corruption.\n- **Session-aware hooks:** The write guard checks `ORCHESTRATOR_LEAD=1` env var, so teammates retain full write access.\n- **Event-driven monitoring:** The lead processes events sequentially. No polling.\n- **Plan-first execution:** The user approves the plan before any infrastructure is created or code is changed.\n- **Git worktrees:** Each teammate gets an isolated branch. Merge conflicts are resolved one at a time during synthesis.\n\n## Fallback Mode\n\nIf `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is not set, the orchestrator falls back to sequential subagent pipelines. This preserves all context management benefits but executes ~2–4× slower. Quality improvement comes from discipline and isolation, not parallelism.\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- **Smarter triage** — cost/complexity estimation before deciding whether to orchestrate, with configurable thresholds\n- **Auto-retry for failed workstreams** — detect a stalled or crashed teammate and re-spawn with context from the ledger\n- **Multi-repo support** — orchestrate work that spans more than one git repository, with per-repo worktrees\n- **Richer synthesis reports** — structured diff summary per workstream with test results inline\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **Fallback mode is significantly slower** — sequential subagent pipelines provide the same isolation benefits but without parallelism; complex tasks may take 2–4× longer than in teams mode\n- **Worktree cleanup can fail** if a teammate process crashes mid-write and leaves a lock file; run `git worktree prune` manually if cleanup scripts report errors\n- **Write guard does not cover `Bash` tool** — the lead write guard blocks `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` but teammates could still make indirect changes via shell commands; rely on code review for enforcement in these cases\n- **Teams mode is experimental** — requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` and may change behavior between Claude Code versions\n",

Includes three specialized agents and five validation scripts.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Skills Over Monolith** — Knowledge is partitioned into 27 focused skills rather than one large document. Each skill loads only when Claude detects relevant context, minimising context cost on every task.\n\n**[P2] IQS Compliance from Day One** — Integration Quality Scale coverage (all 52 rules) is a first-class requirement, not a post-publication concern. The plugin guides toward Gold tier from the first line of code.\n\n**[P3] Modern Patterns Only** — The plugin tracks and enforces current HA APIs. Deprecated code paths (`hass.data`, `OptionsFlow.__init__`, etc.) are flagged and replaced — the plugin never silently tolerates outdated patterns.\n\n**[P4] Safety for Live Connections** — The MCP server connects to live Home Assistant instances in read-mostly mode. Destructive service calls require explicit dry-run bypass. The plugin never risks unintended home automation state changes.\n\n**[P5] Quality by Example** — Abstract guidance is backed by three concrete reference integrations at Bronze, Silver, and Gold tier — copy-paste starting points that already meet their tier requirements in full.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the L3DigitalNet marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install home-assistant-dev@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\nOr for local development:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins.git\nclaude --plugin-dir ./Claude-Code-Plugins/plugins/home-assistant-dev\n```\n\n## Installation Notes\n\nVerify the plugin loaded correctly after installation:\n```bash\n/plugin list\n/skills    # Shows all available skills including the 27 ha-* skills\n```\n\nValidation scripts (`scripts/`) require Python 3.13+ and are run directly from the plugin cache directory or the source tree.\n\n## Usage\n\nSkills trigger automatically based on your prompts — no manual invocation needed:\n\n```\n\"Create a new integration for my smart thermostat\"\n→ Loads ha-integration-scaffold, ha-config-flow, ha-coordinator\n\n\"My entities are showing unavailable\"\n→ Loads ha-debugging, ha-coordinator\n\n\"Prepare my integration for HACS\"\n→

This Plugin Knows\n\n### Home Assistant 2025+ Requirements\n\n- Python 3.13 required (HA 2025.2+)\n- Modern type syntax (`list[str]` not `List[str]`)\n- `from __future__ import annotations` everywhere\n- Config flow mandatory (no YAML-only)\n- `entry.runtime_data` instead of `hass.data[DOMAIN]`\n\n### Integration Quality Scale\n\nThe plugin covers all 52 IQS rules across 4 tiers:\n\n| Tier | Rules | Key Requirements |\n|------|-------|------------------|\n| **Bronze** | 18 | Config flow, unique IDs, tests, branding |\n| **Silver** | 10 | Error handling, reauth, options, unload |\n| **Gold** | 21 | Diagnostics, repairs, translations, discovery |\n| **Platinum** | 3 | Async library, websession injection, strict typing |\n\n### Deprecation Coverage\n\n- ServiceInfo import relocation (2025.1 → 2026.2)\n- `hass.data[DOMAIN]` → `entry.runtime_data`\n- OptionsFlow `__init__` deprecation\n- VacuumActivity enum migration\n- Camera WebRTC changes\n- Type annotation modernization\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nhome-assistant-dev/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json\n├── skills/                    # 27 skills\n├── agents/                    # 3

connect to a running HA instance via REST API to inspect real entity states during development\n- **Auto-test generation** — generate pytest test stubs from a finished integration's config flow and coordinator code\n- **IQS progress dashboard** — interactive checklist showing which Quality Scale rules are satisfied vs. outstanding for the current integration\n- **More deprecation tracking** — auto-detect and suggest fixes for newly deprecated APIs as HA versions advance\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **IQS rule coverage may lag** — the 52 rules tracked reflect HA up to the 2025.x cycle; new rules added in future HA releases will need skill updates before they appear in quality reviews\n- **`generate-integration` can time out on large specs** — very detailed generation prompts may hit context limits; break the request into multiple passes using the scaffold command followed by targeted skill invocations\n- **Scripts require a Python environment** — validation scripts must be run in an environment where `python3` is available; they are not installed as executables\n- **`ha-quality-review` skill is read-only** — the skill identifies rule violations but does not auto-fix them; apply fixes manually or invoke the relevant implementation skills\n\n## References\n\n- [Home Assistant Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)\n- [Integration Quality

        "plugins/github-repo-manager/README.md": "# GitHub Repo Manager\n\nConversational GitHub repository health assessment and maintenance.\n\n## Summary\n\nGitHub Repo Manager provides a single `/repo-manager` command that assesses and fixes repository health interactively, with owner approval at every step. State what you want in natural language — Claude determines the scope, auto-detects the repository tier, and guides you through a structured session covering 9 assessment modules: security, release health, community health, PR management, issue triage, dependency audit, notifications, discussions, and wiki sync. A structured maintenance report is generated at session end.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Context at Decision Points** — Surface relevant context when a decision is required — enough to act, not a tutorial. Skip explanation for actions whose purpose is obvious from the invocation.\n\n**[P2] Implication Warnings** — When an action has consequences the owner may not anticipate, name them before acting. This applies especially to publicly visible or hard-to-reverse actions.\n\n**[P3] Irreversibility Flags** — Actions that cannot be easily undone are called out clearly before execution, with specific guidance on what becomes hard to recover.\n\n**[P4] Risk-Proportional Friction** — Confirmation depth scales with the repository's public footprint and action reversibility. Private internal repos get minimal friction; public repos with active releases warrant additional care before irreversible operations.\n\n**[P5] Progressive Depth** — Concise by default; deeper detail available on request.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install github-repo-manager@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\n## Installation Notes\n\nAfter installation, the plugin's `ensure-deps.sh` script runs automatically on first use and installs the Node.js helper dependencies — no manual step required.\n\nTo pre-install explicitly (optional):\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/l3digitalnet-plugins/github-repo-manager\nbash scripts/setup.sh\n```\n\nA GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo`, `read:org`, and `notifications` scopes is required. See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for full setup instructions.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/repo-manager\nCheck ha-light-controller\n```\n\nAfter activation, state what you need — Claude infers the mode:\n\n| You say | Claude does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| \"Check ha-light-controller\" | Deep single-repo assessment |\n| \"How are the PRs on my-project?\" | Narrow single-repo check |\n| \"Are any repos missing SECURITY.md?\" | Cross-repo targeted check |\n| \"What's the state of my public repos?\" | Cross-repo summary |\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/repo-manager` | Activate GitHub repository management session |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `repo-manager` | Session onboarding, tier system, communication style, and error handling |\n| `repo-manager-assessment` | Full assessment orchestration — module order, cross-module dedup, unified findings, reports |\n| `repo-manager-reference` | gh-manager helper command reference |\n| `repo-config` | Configuration system — per-repo, portfolio config, precedence, validation |\n| `community-health` | Audit and manage CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR templates |\n| `cross-repo` | Scope inference, batch mutations, and portfolio scanning across multiple repos |\n| `dependency-audit` | Audit dependency health via dependency graph and Dependabot PRs |\n| `discussions` | Manage GitHub Discussions — find unanswered questions, close resolved threads |\n| `issue-triage` | Triage issues — label, categorize, detect linked PRs, identify stale issues |\n| `notifications` | Process GitHub notifications with priority classification |\n| `pr-management` | Manage PRs — triage, staleness, label management, review requests, merge workflow |\n| `release-health` | Audit release health — unreleased commits, CHANGELOG drift, release cadence |\n| `security` | Audit security posture — Dependabot alerts, code scanning, secret scanning |\n| `wiki-sync` | Synchronize GitHub wiki content with in-repo docs |\n| `self-test` | Self-diagnostics — verify PAT scopes, gh-manager install, and API connectivity |\n\n## Tier System\n\nRepos are auto-classified into four tiers that control how much ceremony the plugin applies:\n\n| Tier | Repo type | Mutations |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 | Private, docs only | Batch approval, direct commit |\n| 2 | Private, runnable code | Show diffs, direct commit |\n| 3 | Public, no releases | Detailed review, direct commit |\n| 4 | Public, with releases | PRs for file changes, full review |\n\nTier is auto-detected on first run and can be overridden in config.\n\n## Configuration\n\n| File | Location | Purpose |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| `.github-repo-manager.yml` | Repo root | Per-repo module toggles and thresholds |\n| `portfolio.yml` | `~/.config/github-repo-manager/` | Central config for cross-repo settings |\n\nConfig precedence (highest to lowest): portfolio per-repo overrides → per-repo config → portfolio defaults → tier defaults.\n\nSee [docs/POLICIES.md](docs/POLICIES.md) for all customizable settings and [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for the full helper CLI reference.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 18+\n- GitHub PAT with `repo`, `read:org`, and `notifications` scopes\n- Target repositories must be accessible via the authenticated GitHub account\n\n## Architecture Note\n\nThis plugin intentionally runs entirely in the owner's main context window — no subagents are spawned during a session. This is a deliberate design choice: the owner must stay in the conversation loop at every step (tier confirmation, action approvals, module redirects), which requires continuous access to the shared context. The trade-off is that a full 9-module assessment consumes more context than a subagent-isolated design would. This is mitigated by keeping command files thin, delegating all API interaction to the external `gh-manager` helper (which runs outside the context window), and structured module presentation that avoids redundant output.\n\nThe core approval invariant (\"no action without owner approval\") is enforced behaviorally — conversational approval happens in prose and cannot be captured as a programmatic signal for hooks. Two mechanical layers complement the behavioral enforcement: a **PreToolUse guard** (`scripts/gh-manager-guard.sh`) that warns the agent when a mutation command is about to execute so it can abort if no prior approval exists, and a **PostToolUse audit trail** (`scripts/gh-manager-monitor.sh`) that logs completed mutations to `~/.github-repo-manager-audit.log` for recovery. Both hooks also provide rate-limit awareness via the `_rate_limit` field in gh-manager JSON output.\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- **GitLab support** — `glab`-backed equivalent for GitLab repositories and merge requests\n- **Stale issue auto-close** — configurable threshold for automatically closing inactive issues after owner review\n- **Scheduled reports** — cron-driven maintenance reports without requiring a manual session\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **Insufficient PAT scopes cause silent module failures** — if the PAT lacks `notifications` scope, the notifications module returns empty results with no error; verify scopes with `gh-manager auth verify`\n- **Cross-repo operations are rate-limited** — large portfolios may hit GitHub API rate limits during batch scans; check status with `gh-manager auth rate-limit` and use per-module checks to stay within limits\n- **No dry-run for most mutation types** — only wiki operations (`wiki init`, `wiki push`) support `--dry-run`. PR merges, issue closes, label operations, and direct file commits do not have a dry-run preview; the tier system and owner approval flows are the primary safeguards for these actions\n",
        "plugins/release-pipeline/README.md": "# Release Pipeline\n\n**Version:** 1.4.2 — Interactive release pipeline for any repo. One command, six options.\n\n## Summary\n\nRelease Pipeline streamlines the full release lifecycle into a single `/release` command. It auto-detects your repository state, suggests a semantic version from conventional commits, runs pre-flight checks in parallel (tests, docs, git state), generates a changelog entry, and creates a tagged GitHub release — all with fail-fast behavior and no destructive auto-recovery.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Fail Fast, No Auto-Recovery** — If any pre-flight check fails, the pipeline stops immediately and reports. It never attempts to repair problems autonomously or continue past a known failure.\n\n**[P2] Gate at Genuine Irreversibility** — Explicit approval is required before creating tags and publishing GitHub releases — these are public, hard to retract, and exceed what the invocation implies. Version bumps and changelog generation proceed on clear intent; they remain editable before the pipeline reaches an irreversible gate.\n\n**[P3] Conventional Commits as Ground Truth** — Version bump suggestions and changelog entries are derived from commit message prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`). The history is the specification; the pipeline reads it, not the developer's memory.\n\n**[P4] Parallel Where Possible** — Pre-flight checks (tests, docs, git state) run in parallel agents. Concurrency is exploited where safe; sequential logic is preserved at critical approval gates.\n\n**[P5] Dry Run for Tag-Creating Paths** — All release paths that create tags or GitHub releases (Full Release, Plugin Release) support a full simulation via Dry Run that exercises complete pipeline logic without any mutations. Release Status provides a read-only preview for Quick Merge.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install release-pipeline@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/release\n```\n\nOr trigger naturally: \"ship it\", \"merge to main\", \"cut a release\", \"release v1.2.0\"\n\nThe command auto-detects your repository state and presents a context-aware menu. The menu adapts: monorepos show an unreleased plugin count, dirty trees warn about uncommitted changes, and version suggestions are calculated from conventional commits (`feat` → minor, `fix` → patch, `BREAKING CHANGE` → major).\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/release` | Open the interactive release menu |\n\n## Hooks\n\nThree background hooks are installed automatically and run without invocation:\n\n| Hook | Event | Behavior |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| `sync-local-plugins.sh` | SessionStart | Syncs local plugin source from the development repo to the installed Claude Code cache. Discovery order: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` first, then `$HOME/projects/Claude-Code-Plugins` as a fallback. Only syncs plugins that are already installed (cache dir exists). |\n| `force-push-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks any `git push --force` or `git push -f` command. Returns a block decision — the command does not execute. |\n| `auto-build-plugins.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | On `git commit`, checks for staged TypeScript source files in `plugins/<name>/src/`. If found and the plugin has a `build` npm script, runs `npm run build`, stages the resulting `dist/` directory, and then lets the commit proceed. Blocks the commit if the build fails. Outputs a notice before building so the side-effect is visible. |\n\n**Note:** `force-push-guard.sh` and `auto-build-plugins.sh` are registered sequentially under the same PreToolUse/Bash matcher. If the force-push guard blocks a command (exits 2), `auto-build-plugins.sh` does not run for that command.\n\n## Pre-flight Agents\n\nFull Release and Plugin Release spawn three agents in parallel during Phase 1:\n\n| Agent | Role | Output format |\n|-------|------|---------------|\n| `test-runner` | Detects and runs the project's test suite | `TEST RESULTS` block — PASS / FAIL with count and details |\n| `docs-auditor` | Checks docs for stale versions, broken links, and tone | `DOCS AUDIT` block — PASS / WARN / FAIL |\n| `git-preflight` | Validates branch, noreply email, and tag availability | `GIT PRE-FLIGHT` block — PASS / FAIL per check |\n\n## Release Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Quick Merge | Commit and merge testing → main (no version bump) |\n| Full Release | Semver release with pre-flight, changelog, tag, GitHub release |\n| Plugin Release | Release a single plugin from a monorepo (scoped tag + changelog) |\n| Release Status | Show unreleased commits, last tag, changelog drift |\n| Dry Run | Simulate a full release without any changes (`bump-version.sh --dry-run` + `generate-changelog.sh --preview`) |\n| Changelog Preview | Generate and display a changelog entry |\n\n## Full Release Workflow\n\n| Phase | Action | Parallel? |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| 0. Detection | Auto-detect repo state, suggest version | Yes |\n| 1. Pre-flight | Run tests, audit docs, check git state | Yes (3 agents) |\n| 2. Preparation | Bump versions, generate changelog, show diff | Sequential |\n| 3. Release | Commit, merge, tag, push, GitHub release | Sequential |\n| 4. Verification | Confirm tag, release page, notes | Sequential |\n\nIf anything fails, the pipeline stops immediately and suggests rollback steps. No destructive auto-recovery.\n\n## Supported Test Runners\n\nAuto-detected from project files:\n\n- **Python**: pytest (pyproject.toml, pytest.ini, setup.cfg)\n- **Node.js**: npm test (package.json)\n- **Rust**: cargo test (Cargo.toml)\n- **Go**: go test (go.mod)\n- **Make**: make test (Makefile)\n- **Fallback**: reads CLAUDE.md for test commands\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- **GitLab support** — detect GitLab remotes and use the `glab` CLI for releases and MR management\n- **PyPI / npm publish step** — optional post-release package publish with `twine` or `npm publish`\n- **Rollback automation** — `/release rollback` option that reverses a tag, reverts the merge, and re-opens the PR\n- **Multi-package monorepo** — release multiple packages in one pass with per-package changelogs and tags\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **GitHub release requires `gh` CLI** — the Full Release and Plugin Release options create GitHub releases via `gh`; if `gh` is not authenticated, these steps will fail with a permission error\n- **Changelog generation assumes conventional commits** — version bump suggestions and changelog entries rely on `feat:`, `fix:`, and `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefixes; non-conventional commit histories will produce a flat \"Other changes\" section\n- **Dry Run does not simulate GitHub API calls** — the Dry Run option skips all git and file mutations but cannot simulate the GitHub release API; actual release creation may still fail after a clean dry run\n",
        "plugins/linux-sysadmin-mcp/README.md": "# Linux Sysadmin MCP\n\nA comprehensive Linux system administration MCP server for Claude Code. Provides ~107 tools across 15 modules for managing packages, services, users, firewall, networking, containers, storage, security, performance, logs, cron, backups, SSH, and documentation — all through a unified, distro-agnostic interface.\n\n## Summary\n\nLinux Sysadmin MCP gives Claude Code a structured, risk-aware interface for administering Linux systems. Tools are grouped into modules by domain, classified by risk level, and require explicit confirmation for state-changing operations above a configurable threshold. YAML knowledge profiles encode service-specific expertise (config paths, health checks, restart risks) so Claude can make informed decisions without requiring you to explain your stack each session.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Composable, Not Monolithic** — Each tool does one thing well. Complex workflows are assembled from atomic tools at runtime, not baked into mega-commands.\n\n**[P2] Universal Knowledge, Not Environment Configuration** — Embedded knowledge contains only facts true for any standard installation of a tool. IP addresses, hostnames, custom scripts, and environment-specific details are the user's responsibility.\n\n**[P3] Documentation-Driven Reproducibility** — Every system Claude administers must be fully reproducible from its documentation alone. Documentation is a first-class output of every state-changing operation — the disaster recovery plan, not an afterthought.\n\n**[P4] Distro-Agnostic** — Abstract over package managers, init systems, firewall backends, and filesystem conventions. Detect and adapt at runtime; never assume a specific distro.\n\n**[P5] Gate Genuine Irreversibility** — Gate only on operations that are truly irreversible at the system level: data destruction, partition changes, user deletion. Routine state-changing operations — service restarts, config edits, package installs — execute on clear intent.\n\n**[P6] Graceful Coexistence** — Detect and defer to existing MCP servers when present. Fill gaps rather than duplicate.\n\n**[P7] Observable** — Every tool returns structured output Claude can reason over. No silent failures; no ambiguous states.\n\n**[P8] Least Privilege** — Request only the permissions needed for the specific operation. Escalate explicitly and visibly.\n\n**[P9] Sudo-First Execution** — All commands requiring elevated privileges are executed via `sudo`. The plugin never assumes it is running as root.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nAdd to Claude Code config (`~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"linux-sysadmin\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/linux-sysadmin-mcp/dist/server.bundle.cjs\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Installation Notes\n\nOn first run, a default configuration file is generated at `~/.config/linux-sysadmin/config.yaml`. Review it before first use — particularly `safety.confirmation_threshold` and `documentation.repo_path` if you want git-backed host documentation.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the MCP server is running, Claude can invoke any of the ~100 tools directly in conversation.

        "plugins/design-assistant/README.md": "# Design Assistant\n\nFull design document lifecycle in two commands.\n\n## Summary\n\nDesign Assistant provides a structured approach to technical design — from blank page to reviewed document. `/design-draft` conducts a guided interview that discovers and stress-tests your design principles before writing a single line of architecture. `/design-review` then enforces those principles across multiple passes, surfacing violations, gaps, and ambiguities until the document converges. Both commands share a common principles registry format, enabling automatic warm handoff from draft to review.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Principles Before Architecture** — No architecture, diagrams, or design decisions are committed until principles have been discovered, stress-tested, and locked by the human. Architecture serves principles, not the other way around.\n\n**[P2] Tensions Are Resolved, Not Hidden** — Every conflict between candidate principles is surfaced explicitly and traced to a stable tiebreaker rule before drafting begins. Unresolved tensions become design debt.\n\n**[P3] Principles Are the Review Standard** — Design review enforces the document's own stated principles, not an external checklist. A proposed fix that closes a gap while violating a principle is not a valid resolution.\n\n**[P4] PRINCIPLE Findings Are Never Auto-Fixed** — Principle violations always require individual human review, regardless of auto-fix mode or the principle's own eligibility setting. The human who locked the principles decides when to break them.\n\n**[P5] Convergence, Not Single-Pass** — A document is not complete when a review pass finishes — it is complete when zero findings remain across all tracks. The review loop runs until convergence is measured.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install design-assistant@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTypical workflow:\n\n```\n1. /design-draft \"Project Name\"\n   → Interview → Principles → Draft\n\n2. (B) Begin /design-review immediately  ← automatic warm handoff\n   or: /design-review path/to/draft.md\n\n3. Iterate until convergence (typically 3–5 passes)\n\n4. export log → archive alongside document\n```\n\nBoth commands accept mid-session commands: `pause / continue`, `show principles`, `show open questions`, `finalize`.\n\nAll saved artifacts go to `[project-folder]/docs/` — the project folder is established on the first write of each session.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/design-draft` | Guided document authoring — interview, principles discovery, and draft generation |\n| `/design-review` | Iterative review — principle enforcement, gap analysis, and optional auto-fix |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `design-draft` | Loaded by `/design-draft` — phases, interview patterns, principles stress-testing |\n| `design-review` | Loaded by `/design-review` — review tracks, auto-fix modes, gap categories |\n\n## `/design-draft` — Guided Document Authoring\n\nA structured interview that discovers your design principles before writing any architecture.

The installed plugin includes a read-counter hook that provides early warnings at 10 and 20 reads.\n- **Cold-start review has limited analysis** — without a principles section and without a warm handoff from `/design-draft`, Track B (principle enforcement) is skipped entirely\n- **`pause/continue` state is session-local** — session snapshots are held in the active conversation context; starting a new Claude Code session requires pasting the snapshot\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n- **Tension resolution and finding-queue prompts remain as formatted text** — these decision points have 5+ options (A–E or more), which intentionally exceeds the `AskUserQuestion` limit of 4. All 2–4 option decision points use `AskUserQuestion`; 5+ option points use formatted text. This is a deliberate convention, not a limitation.\n- **Large command files** — both commands are 1,000–1,500 lines by design. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for rationale (AD3: template externalization doesn't reduce context cost for single-agent behavioral plugins).\n",
        "plugins/plugin-test-harness/README.md": "# Plugin Test Harness (PTH)\n\nAn MCP-based iterative testing framework for Claude Code plugins and MCP servers. Drives a tight test/fix/reload loop — generating tests, recording pass/fail results, applying source fixes, reloading the target plugin, and retesting — until your plugin converges to a stable, passing state.\n\n## Summary\n\nPTH treats plugin testing as an iterative convergence problem rather than a one-shot process. Each session creates a dedicated git branch in the target plugin's repository, giving you a complete audit trail of every test added and fix applied. Sessions persist to disk and can be resumed after interruption. Claude drives the loop interactively — you can inspect results, override decisions, or add tests at any point.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Claude's Judgment, Not Mechanical Rules** — No rigid enforcement gates or hard-coded safety thresholds. Claude assesses risk, decides approval workflows, and manages safety contextually — because tests span wildly varying plugin domains and environment configurations where rigid rules would be either too restrictive or too permissive.\n\n**[P2] Convergence Over Single-Pass** — Testing is an iterative convergence problem. PTH drives successive test/fix/reload cycles and measures the trend (improving, plateau, oscillating, diverging) across iterations. A plugin is not done when the first run passes.\n\n**[P3] Durable Session Assets** — The git branch and test definitions are the session's durable assets. If the environment fails catastrophically, the session can always be resumed from these.\n\n**[P4] Transparent Errors** — PTH always surfaces raw error output alongside its own interpretation. Exceptions are never silently swallowed; Claude always has enough context to decide the next step.\n\n**[P5] Audit Trail by Default** — Every fix is committed to the session branch immediately. The full debug history is always recoverable via `git log` — no extra logging or manual export required.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install plugin-test-harness@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\n## Installation Notes\n\nAfter installation, navigate to the plugin cache directory and install Node.js dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/<marketplace>/plugin-test-harness\nnpm install\n```\n\nThe `dist/` directory ships prebuilt — a build step is only required if you modify the TypeScript source.\n\n## Usage\n\nPTH operates as an iterative loop. Start with a preflight check, then cycle through generate → run → record → fix → reload until convergence:\n\n```\npth_preflight       → verify target plugin is readable, detect its type\npth_start_session   → create session + git branch in the target repo\npth_generate_tests  → auto-generate test proposals from plugin source\n[Run tests manually or via Claude]\npth_record_result   → record pass/fail for each test\npth_get_iteration_status → check convergence trend\npth_apply_fix       → patch source, sync to cache, reload\n[Repeat from pth_generate_tests]\npth_end_session     → generate final report, close branch\n```\n\nTo resume an interrupted session:\n```\npth_resume_session({ pluginPath: \"...\", branch: \"pth/my-plugin-2026-02-18-abc123\" })\n```\n\n## Tools\n\n### Session Management\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `pth_preflight` | Validate target plugin is readable and detect its type |\n| `pth_start_session` | Create a new test session and git branch |\n| `pth_resume_session` | Resume an interrupted session by branch name |\n| `pth_end_session` | Close session and generate final report |\n| `pth_get_session_status` | Current session state, iteration count, pass/fail summary |\n\n### Test Management\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `pth_generate_tests` | Auto-generate test proposals from plugin source and schema |\n| `pth_list_tests` | List all tests in the session with pass/fail status |\n| `pth_create_test` | Manually add a single test (provide YAML inline) |\n| `pth_edit_test` | Modify an existing test by ID |\n\n### Execution & Results\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `pth_record_result` | Record pass/fail for a test after running it |\n| `pth_get_results` | Fetch all results for current or past iterations |\n| `pth_get_test_impact` | Show which tests are affected by a specific fix |\n| `pth_get_iteration_status` | Convergence trend, pass rate, and recommendation for next step |\n\n### Fix Management\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `pth_apply_fix` | Apply a source patch and commit it to the session branch |\n| `pth_sync_to_cache` | Sync session branch files to the plugin cache directory |\n| `pth_reload_plugin` | Restart the target MCP server after a fix |\n| `pth_get_fix_history` | List all fixes applied in this session |\n| `pth_revert_fix` | Revert a specific fix by commit hash |\n| `pth_diff_session` | Show all changes made since session start |\n\n## Modes\n\nPTH auto-detects the target plugin type during `pth_preflight` — no `mode` parameter needed.\n\n| Mode | When used | How PTH tests |\n|------|-----------|---------------|\n| `mcp` | Plugin has `.mcp.json` and exposes MCP tools | Connects as a native MCP client; introspects tool schemas via `tools/list` |\n| `plugin` | Hook-based or command-only plugin | Analyses source files (hooks, commands, skills) to infer expected behavior |\n\n## Test YAML Format\n\nTests are stored as YAML files in the session directory:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"list-tools-returns-array\"\nname: \"tools/list returns an array\"\ndescription: \"The MCP server must respond to tools/list with a non-empty array.\"\nmode: \"mcp\"\ntype: \"scenario\"\nsteps:\n  - tool: \"tools/list\"\n    input: {}\n    expect:\n      success: true\n      output_contains: \"tools\"\ntags:\n  - \"smoke\"\n  - \"protocol\"\n```\n\n`expect` supports: `success`, `output_contains`, `output_equals`, `output_matches`, `output_json`, `error_contains`, `exit_code`, `stdout_contains`, `stdout_matches`.\n\n## Session Branches\n\nEvery session creates a dedicated git branch in the **target plugin's repository**:\n\n```\npth/<plugin>-<timestamp>\n```\n\nAfter a session ends:\n\n```bash\n# See all commits from the session\ngit log pth/my-plugin-2026-02-18-abc123 --oneline\n\n# Diff the entire session against the base branch\ngit diff main...pth/my-plugin-2026-02-18-abc123\n\n# Merge a successful session to main\ngit checkout main && git merge --no-ff pth/my-plugin-2026-02-18-abc123\n```\n\nAbandoned sessions can be deleted without affecting your working branches:\n```bash\ngit branch -d pth/my-plugin-2026-02-18-abc123\n```\n\n## Convergence\n\n`pth_get_iteration_status` reports the current trend across iterations:\n\n| Trend | Meaning | Recommended action |\n|-------|---------|-------------------|\n| `improving` | Pass rate rising each iteration | Keep iterating |\n| `plateau` | Pass rate has stalled | Try a different fix strategy |\n| `oscillating` | Tests flip between pass and fail | Use `pth_get_test_impact` to find the regressing fix |\n| `diverging` | Pass rate is falling | Use `pth_revert_fix` before continuing |\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 20+\n- Target plugin must be accessible on the local filesystem\n- For `mcp` mode: the target MCP server must be startable via its `.mcp.json` command\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- **Parallel test execution** — run independent tests concurrently to reduce session iteration time\n- **HTML report export** — generate a self-contained HTML report from a completed session for sharing outside Claude\n- **Test suite import** — seed a new session from an existing YAML test file rather than starting from zero\n- **Watch mode** — automatically trigger a new iteration whenever source files in the target plugin change\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **`npm install` must be run manually** — the plugin installer does not execute `npm install`; dependencies are not available until you run it in the plugin cache directory (see Installation Notes above)\n- **`pth_reload_plugin` only works for MCP servers** — reloading hook-based or command-only plugins requires restarting the Claude Code session\n- **Session state is local** — session files are written to a subdirectory of the plugin cache; if the cache is cleared or the plugin is reinstalled, in-progress sessions cannot be resumed\n- **`pth_apply_fix` commits immediately** — there is no staging area; use `pth_revert_fix` to undo a commit if a fix causes regressions\n\n## Project Links\n\n- Repository: [L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins](https://github.com/L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins)\n- Design document: `docs/PTH-DESIGN.md`\n- Issues and feedback: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins/issues)\n",
        "plugins/plugin-review/README.md": "# Plugin Review\n\nComprehensive review of Claude Code plugins covering principles alignment, terminal UX quality, and documentation freshness. Uses an orchestrator–subagent architecture to manage context budget across multi-pass review sessions.\n\n## Summary\n\nPlugin Review addresses the challenge of systematically auditing a Claude Code plugin against its own stated principles, terminal UX best practices, and documentation accuracy — all without exhausting the context window. The orchestrator manages the convergence loop (setup → analyze → report → propose → implement → re-audit) while delegating deep file reading and analysis to three focused subagents with disposable context. The result is thorough multi-pass reviews that converge within a 3-pass budget.\n\n## Principles\n\n**[P1] Orchestrator Leanness** — The orchestrator holds only structural metadata (principles checklist, touchpoint map, convergence table, user decisions) — never raw source file contents. All deep file reading is delegated to subagents.\n\n**[P2] Disposable Analysis** — Each analysis track runs in its own subagent whose context is discarded after it returns a structured summary. This is the primary mechanism for managing token budget across multi-pass reviews.\n\n**[P3] On-Demand Template Loading** — Analysis criteria, report formats, and impact-check templates are externalized files loaded only by the component that needs them. The orchestrator never loads track-specific criteria into its own context.\n\n**[P4] Scoped Re-audit** — Pass 2+ never re-runs the full three-track analysis. Only tracks affected by files changed in the previous pass are re-analyzed. Unchanged findings carry forward without re-analysis.\n\n**[P5] Pass Budget Enforcement** — The review targets convergence within 3 passes. Exceeding this budget requires an explicit user decision — the orchestrator does not silently continue looping.\n\n**[P6] Documentation Co-mutation** — Every implementation change must include corresponding documentation updates in the same pass. The `doc-write-tracker` hook mechanically warns when implementation files are modified without any documentation updates in the session — catching the most common failure mode (forgetting to update docs entirely). Full blocking enforcement of this rule requires a manual pre-completion check.\n\n**[P7] Cross-Track Impact Awareness** — Before implementation, each proposed change must note which other tracks it could affect. This catches regressions before they happen rather than discovering them on re-audit.\n\n**[P8] Severity-Led Reporting** — Reports lead with open findings sorted by severity. Upheld principles and clean touchpoints are summarized in a compact roll-up line, not given individual detail blocks.\n\n**[P9] Subagents Analyze, Orchestrator Acts** — Subagents only read files and return structured analysis. All code changes, file modifications, and user interactions are handled by the orchestrator directly.\n\n## Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoints are cross-cutting quality checks applied during review. Unlike principles (which govern this plugin's own architecture), checkpoints evaluate qualities of the *target* plugin being reviewed.\n\n**[C1] LLM-Optimized Commenting** — Code comments should be written for the AI sessions that will read, modify, and review this code — not for a human scanning line by line. Comments that restate syntax waste tokens. Comments that explain intent, constraints, decision history, and cross-file relationships prevent regressions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add L3DigitalNet/Claude-Code-Plugins\n/plugin install plugin-review@l3digitalnet-plugins\n```\n\nOr test locally:\n```\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/plugin-review\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `/review` and name the plugin to audit (or pick from a list). The orchestrator will triage-read structural files, build a principles checklist and touchpoint map, then spawn analyst subagents for deep review.\n\nDuring a review session, these commands are available:\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `skip [Pn]` or `skip [finding]` | Accept a finding as out-of-scope |\n| `focus on [Pn\\|UX\\|principles\\|docs]` | Prioritize a specific area next pass |\n| `light pass` | Run only tracks affected by recent changes |\n| `revert last pass` | Undo the last batch of changes |\n| `stop` or `looks good` | End the review and print the final summary |\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/review` | Launch a multi-pass plugin review with orchestrator–subagent analysis |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `scoped-reaudit` | Determines which analysis tracks to re-run based on files changed in the previous pass |\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `principles-analyst` | Track A — reads implementation files, returns per-principle status table and root architectural alignment |\n| `ux-analyst` | Track B — reads user-facing code paths, returns severity-grouped UX findings |\n| `docs-analyst` | Track C — reads documentation against implementation listing, returns per-file freshness assessment |\n\n## Hooks\n\nAll hooks register declaratively via `hooks/hooks.json` — no runtime setup needed.\n\n| Hook | Event | What it does |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| **Doc write tracker** | PostToolUse (Write\\|Edit\\|MultiEdit\\|NotebookEdit\\|MCP writes) | Tracks which file categories (impl vs. doc) are being written during a review session; warns when implementation files are modified without any documentation files in the same pass |\n| **Agent frontmatter validator** | PostToolUse (Write\\|Edit\\|MultiEdit) | Checks agent definition files for disallowed tools (Write, Edit, Bash, etc.) after each write; warns if tools beyond the read-only allowlist are present in the YAML frontmatter |\n\n## Context Management Strategy\n\nThree-layer defense against context degradation:\n\n1. **Structural** — disposable subagents for deep analysis, externalized templates for criteria and report formats, orchestrator holds only compact summaries\n2. **Persistent** — convergence table, findings summaries, and user decisions survive across passes as compact structured data\n3. **Mechanical** — PostToolUse hook tracks write patterns and warns on documentation co-mutation failures\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\nSee [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for full architectural rationale.\n\n- **Orchestrator + subagent split:** The orchestrator never reads full plugin source files. Three focused subagents each load only the files and criteria for their track, then return compact summaries.\n- **3-pass budget:** Reviews that haven't converged by Pass 3 usually have findings that represent accepted trade-offs. The budget is a structural checkpoint, not a hard wall.\n- **Scoped re-audit:** Pass 2+ only spawns subagents for tracks affected by changed files. The Docs track always runs since any change can introduce documentation drift.\n- **Cross-track impact annotation:** Proposals are annotated with affected tracks before implementation, catching regressions at proposal time rather than on re-audit.\n- **Severity-led reporting:** Pass 1 reports roll up clean items into a single line. Only open findings get full detail blocks.\n",
        "plugins/context-efficiency-toolkit/README.md": "# Context Efficiency Toolkit\n\nA Claude Code plugin that audits plugins for token and context efficiency, then rewrites their instruction files to be as lean as possible without losing behavioral information.\n\n## Why This Exists\n\nPlugins that are wasteful with tokens are not just slow or expensive — they are functionally defective. A plugin that works fine on small inputs but silently degrades on large ones because it bloated its own context is a buggy plugin, not just an inefficient one. This toolkit treats token efficiency as a correctness property and provides a structured, approval-gated workflow to diagnose and fix violations.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/review-context-efficiency`\n\nRuns a five-stage structured audit of a Claude Code plugin against twelve context efficiency principles covering instruction design, runtime behavior, agent architecture, and token budget self-governance.\n\nThe five stages are: Analysis and Diagnosis → Consequence Mapping → Options and Tradeoffs → Implementation Plan → Implementation. Each stage produces a checkpoint where you review findings and approve next steps before Claude proceeds. No changes are made without explicit approval.\n\n**Usage:** Run from any Claude Code session within your plugin workspace. When prompted, provide the path to the plugin root directory or list its files.\n\n### `/tighten-markdown`\n\nApplies a three-pass rewrite process (cut, compress, restructure) to instruction markdown files, eliminating motivational prose, restatements, passive constructions, and unnecessary hedging. Operates on one file at a time with a checkpoint after each pass.\n\n**Usage:** Run after `/review-context-efficiency` to tighten the prose in any instruction files the structural review surfaces as candidates. Can also be run independently on any markdown instruction file.\n\n## The Twelve Principles\n\nThe review standard is built on twelve principles grouped into four layers.\n\n**Instruction Design (P1–P3):** Imperative minimalism, format matching data type, reference over repetition.\n\n**Runtime Efficiency (P4–P6):** Lazy context loading, process and discard, output verbosity matching its consumer.\n\n**Agent Architecture (P7–P9):** Decompose by scope not convenience, subagents return structured extracts, orchestrator synthesizes rather than re-analyzes.\n\n**Token Budget Awareness (P10–P12):** Fail fast and surface early, choose the lighter path when outcomes are equivalent, verbosity scales inverse to context depth.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\nRun `/review-context-efficiency` first to address structural and architectural issues. Then run `/tighten-markdown` on each instruction file the structural review surfaces as a candidate. Fixing structure before tightening prose ensures you are not polishing language on top of architecture that is about to change.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin install context-efficiency-toolkit@claude-code-plugins\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
