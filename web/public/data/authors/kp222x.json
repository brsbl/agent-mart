        "plugins/smart-compact/README.md": "# Smart Compact Plugin\n\nIntelligent context compaction for Claude Code with auto-execution.\n\n## What it does\n\nWhen your conversation context is getting full, this plugin:\n1. Analyzes your current conversation\n2. Generates smart preservation instructions (what to keep)\n3. Automatically executes `/compact` with those instructions\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/kp222x/claude-plugins\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install smart-compact\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe auto-execution feature requires `pyautogui`:\n\n```bash\npip install pyautogui\n```\n\n**Platform-specific notes:**\n- **macOS**: Works out of the box (may need accessibility permissions)\n- **Windows**: Works with pyautogui\n- **Linux**: May need `python3-tk` and `python3-dev` packages\n\n## Usage\n\nWhen you want to compact with smart context preservation:\n\n```\n/smart-compact\n```\n\nThe plugin will:\n1. Analyze what you've been working on\n2. Identify key files, decisions, and context to preserve\n3. Generate compact instructions\n4. Automatically execute `/compact` with those instructions\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Analysis Phase**: Claude reviews the conversation to identify:\n   - Files edited or created\n   - Key decisions made\n   - Tasks in progress\n   - Important technical context\n\n2. **Instruction Generation**: Creates a concise summary (~100-300 words) focusing on what's needed to continue the work\n\n3. **Auto-Execution**: Uses `pyautogui` to type and execute the `/compact` command with the generated instructions\n\n## Manual Alternative\n\nIf auto-execution doesn't work on your system, you can:\n1. Run `/smart-compact`\n2. Copy the instructions from `~/.claude/smart-compact-instructions.txt`\n3. Manually run `/compact [paste instructions]`\n\n## Cross-Platform Support\n\n| Platform | Keyboard Simulation | Notifications |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------|\n| macOS | pyautogui | osascript |\n| Windows | pyautogui | win10toast |\n| Linux | pyautogui | notify-send |\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/smart-compact/commands/smart-compact.md": "---\ndescription: Analyze conversation and auto-execute /compact with smart preservation instructions\n---\n\n# Smart Compact Analysis\n\nYou are about to help prepare for context compaction. Analyze the current conversation thoroughly and generate preservation instructions.\n\n## Your Task\n\n0. **FIRST - Capture tmux session** - Run this bash command IMMEDIATELY before doing anything else:\n   ```bash\n   tmux display-message -p '#S' > ~/.claude/smart-compact-session.txt 2>/dev/null || echo \"\" > ~/.claude/smart-compact-session.txt\n   ```\n   This saves the tmux session name for background command sending (no focus stealing).\n\n1. **Analyze the conversation** - Review what we've been working on:\n   - What files have been edited or created?\n   - What key decisions were made?\n   - What tasks are in progress or pending?\n   - What important context would be lost if not preserved?\n\n2. **Generate compact instructions** - Create a concise set of instructions for /compact that preserves:\n   - Current task state and progress\n   - Key file paths and their purposes\n   - Important decisions and their rationale\n   - Any TODO items or next steps\n   - Technical context needed to continue work\n\n3. **Save instructions to file** - Write the instructions to `~/.claude/smart-compact-instructions.txt` (cross-platform path)\n\n4. **Auto-execute compact** - After saving, run this command to trigger the compact:\n   ```bash\n   python3 \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/auto-compact.py\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Notify the user** - Output:\n   ```\n   Smart compact instructions saved and auto-compact triggered.\n   The /compact command will execute automatically.\n   ```\n\n## Format for Instructions\n\nKeep instructions concise but comprehensive. Example format:\n\n```\nPreserve: [Main task/goal being worked on]\nFiles: [Key files being modified with brief purpose]\nProgress: [Current state - what's done, what's next]\nContext: [Critical technical details needed to continue]\nDecisions: [Key choices made and why]\nContinue: [Explicit instruction for what to do after compact - e.g., \"Continue implementing X\" or \"Resume fixing the bug in Y\"]\n```\n\n## Important\n\n- Be thorough but concise - compact instructions should be ~100-300 words\n- Focus on what's needed to CONTINUE the work, not a full history\n- Include specific file paths, function names, or technical details that would be hard to rediscover\n- If there are pending TODOs, include them explicitly\n- **ALWAYS include a \"Continue:\" instruction** - this ensures Claude continues working automatically after compact completes instead of waiting for user input\n"
