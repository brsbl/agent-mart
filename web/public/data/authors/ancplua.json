Zero unchecked steps.\n\nClaude Code plugin marketplace. 7 plugins that turn a single AI session into\na parallel workforce with automatic quality gates at every step.\n\n## What this does\n\nA normal developer looks at code one file at a time, finds problems one by one,\nfixes them one by one. With these plugins, you look at all the code at once,\nfind all the problems at once, fix them all in parallel — and every step is\nautomatically checked before moving to the next.\n\n## Plugins\n\n| Plugin | What it does in plain language |\n|--------|-------------------------------|\n| **exodia** | Summons up to 12 AI workers that tackle different parts of your code simultaneously. One finds problems, another fixes them, another reviews the fix — all at the same time |\n| **metacognitive-guard** | Watches the AI while it works. If it's about to cut corners, guess instead of verify, or say \"done\" when it isn't — this blocks it before the mistake happens |\n| **feature-dev** | A guided process for building new things: understand what exists, design the plan, build it, review it. No skipping steps |\n| **hookify** | Custom tripwires you set up. \"Never do X\" or \"Always check Y before Z.\" The AI physically cannot proceed if it violates your rules |\n| **otelwiki** | Built-in reference for OpenTelemetry monitoring standards so the AI writes correct telemetry code instead of guessing |\n| **dotnet-architecture-lint** | Enforces .NET project structure rules automatically — catches version mismatches and structural violations before they ship |\n| **ancplua-project-routing** | Automatically recognizes what kind of project you're in and loads the right tools and rules. No configuration needed |\n\n### How does this work without failing?\n\nEvery step is a gate. Work only moves forward if the gate says PROCEED.\nIf it says HALT — the work stops, gets diagnosed, and gets fixed before\nanything else continues. No hoping. No skipping. No \"it probably works.\"\n\n## Install\n\nAdd the marketplace, then install plugins individually:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add ANcpLua/ancplua-claude-plugins\n\n# Install plugins you want\n/plugin install exodia@ancplua-claude-plugins\n/plugin install metacognitive-guard@ancplua-claude-plugins\n/plugin install hookify@ancplua-claude-plugins\n```\n\n## Technical details\n\n7 plugins, 22 commands, 5 skills, 9 agents, 20 scripts, 6 hook configs.\n\nTri-AI review system: Claude, Copilot, CodeRabbit all review PRs independently.\n\n```text\nplugins/\n├── exodia/                  # parallel agent orchestration (9 commands + 2 skills)\n├── metacognitive-guard/     # quality gates + commit integrity + CI verification\n├── otelwiki/                # OpenTelemetry docs + sync\n├── hookify/                 # user-configurable behavior rules\n├── feature-dev/             # guided feature development + code review\n├── dotnet-architecture-lint/# .NET build pattern enforcement\n└── ancplua-project-routing/ # project-aware agent routing\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- [Claude Code Plugins docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n",

fact-checks with WebSearch |\n| `deep-think-partner` | Deep reasoning | Systematic analysis for complex problems with structured output |\n\n### Skills\n\n| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| `competitive-review` | Before creating/modifying code | Dispatches arch-reviewer and impl-reviewer in parallel competition |\n| `epistemic-checkpoint` | Questions involving versions/dates/status | Forces WebSearch verification before forming beliefs |\n| `metacognitive-guard` | Complex problems with competing constraints | Self-assessment and proactive escalation guidance |\n| `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming \"done\" or \"works\" | Requires actual build/test output before success claims |\n\n### Hooks\n\n| Hook | Event | Purpose |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| `truth-beacon.sh` | SessionStart | Injects authoritative facts (runtime versions, banned APIs) before generation |\n| `epistemic-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Write/Edit) | Blocks writing incorrect version claims or banned APIs |\n| `commit-integrity-hook.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `git commit` with warning suppressions, commented tests, deleted assertions |\n| `struggle-detector.sh` | Stop | Detects hedging/uncertainty patterns; suggests deep-think-partner |\n\n### Utility Scripts\n\n| Script | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|\n| `integrity-check.sh` | Validates staged git changes for 6 shortcut patterns |\n| `verify-local.sh` | Auto-detects project type (dotnet/node/python/go) and runs build+test |\n| `wait-for-ci.sh` | Monitors GitHub Actions workflows until all pass or any fails |\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Struggle Detection\n\nThe `struggle-detector.sh` hook analyzes responses for uncertainty signals:\n\n| Signal | Pattern | Score |\n|--------|---------|-------|\n| Hedging | \"I think\", \"probably\", \"might be\" | +2 per instance |\n| Deflecting | Many questions, short response | +2 per question |\n| Verbose | >400 words, <2 code blocks | +5 base + scaling |\n| Contradiction | \"but actually\", \"wait,\", \"I was wrong\" | +15 |\n| Apologetic | \"sorry\", \"my mistake\", \"let me try again\" | +8 per apology |\n| Weaseling | \"generally\", \"it depends\", \"typically\" | +3 per instance |\n| Restarting | \"let me start over\", \"different approach\" | +20 |\n| No recommendation | Long response without clear advice | +8 |\n| Tool use | \"let me read/search/check...\" | -5 (negative) |\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n\n- Single response score > 25\n- OR 2+ consecutive responses with score > 10\n\n### Epistemic Guard\n\nThe `epistemic-guard.sh` hook blocks writes containing:\n\n- Incorrect version claims (e.g., claiming LTS releases are still in beta)\n- Banned APIs (legacy date/time APIs, legacy locking patterns, legacy JSON libraries)\n\nSee `blackboard/assertions.yaml` for the complete list of blocked patterns and their modern replacements.\n\n### Competitive Review\n\nThe `competitive-review` skill creates a competition between two specialized agents:\n\n```text\nUser question\n     |\n     +-- arch-reviewer (parallel) --> Architecture issues\n     +-- impl-reviewer (parallel) --> Implementation issues + fact-checking\n     |\n     v\nMerged results (deduplicated, scored)\n     |\n     v\ndeep-think-partner (receives verified context)\n```\n\nCompetition framing (\"whoever finds more issues gets promoted\") increases thoroughness.\n\n### Deep-Think Partner\n\nWhen spawned, the `deep-think-partner` agent:\n\n1. **Crystallizes** the problem to essential structure\n2. **Maps** the solution space (dimensions, boundaries, attractors)\n3. **Explores** 3+ distinct approaches in parallel\n4. **Tests** each path adversarially (steel-man, red-team, edge-probe)\n5. **Synthesizes** into actionable output with confidence levels\n\nReturns structured output compatible with TodoWrite for immediate execution.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Automatic Struggle Detection\n\n```text\nUser: \"Should I use event sourcing or CQRS for the span ingestion pipeline?\"\n\nClaude: [Hedging response with uncertainty...]\n\n[struggle-detector.sh triggers]\n\nClaude: \"I'm finding this complex. Want me to spawn a deep-thinker\nfor a more thorough analysis?\"\n```\n\n### Competitive Review (Manual)\n\n```text\nUser: \"Review this implementation before I merge\"\n\nClaude: \"I'm dispatching two competing reviewers to analyze this.\"\n\n[arch-reviewer and impl-reviewer run in parallel]\n\nClaude: \"Review Competition Results:\n\n| Reviewer | Issues Found | HIGH | MED | LOW |\n|----------|--------------|------|-----|-----|\n| arch-reviewer | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 |\n| impl-reviewer | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n\nWinner: impl-reviewer (1 HIGH vs 0 HIGH)\n\nCombined Issues:\n1. HIGH [impl]: Wrong version assumption detected\n2. MED [arch]: Extension methods in wrong project\n...\"\n```\n\n### Epistemic Checkpoint\n\n```text\nUser: \"What version of .NET should I target?\"\n\n[epistemic-checkpoint skill activates]\n\nClaude: \"Epistemic Checkpoint\n\nClaim to verify: Current .NET LTS version\nSource checked: WebSearch + assertions.yaml\nVerified fact: .NET 10 is LTS since November 2025\n\nProceeding with verified baseline...\"\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Ground Truth Assertions\n\nThe plugin includes default assertions in `blackboard/assertions.yaml`. This file defines:\n\n- **Runtime versions** - Current .NET and C# versions with release dates\n- **Banned APIs** - Legacy patterns that should be replaced with modern alternatives\n- **Authority levels** - Whether facts are authoritative, verified, or tentative\n\nOverride with user-level assertions at `~/.claude/assertions.yaml`.\n\n### Tunable Parameters\n\nAdjust in `hooks/scripts/struggle-detector.sh`:\n\n| Parameter | Default | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Score threshold | 25 | Single-response trigger |\n| Consecutive threshold | 2 | Multi-response trigger |\n| Hedging weight | 2x count | Uncertainty penalty |\n| Verbose threshold | 400 words | Rambling detection |\n\n## Architecture\n\n```text\nmetacognitive-guard/\n|-- .claude-plugin/\n|   `-- plugin.json              # Plugin manifest\n|-- agents/\n|   |-- arch-reviewer.md         # Architecture analysis agent\n|   |-- deep-think-partner.md    # Deep reasoning agent (Opus)\n|   `-- impl-reviewer.md         # Implementation analysis agent\n|-- blackboard/\n|   `-- assertions.yaml          # Ground truth facts\n|-- commands/\n|   |-- competitive-review.md    # Dual-agent competition\n|   |-- epistemic-checkpoint.md  # Version/date verification\n|   |-- metacognitive-guard.md   # Self-escalation guidance\n|   `-- verification-before-completion.md  # Pre-completion verification\n|-- hooks/\n|   |-- hooks.json               # Hook configuration (4 hooks)\n|   `-- scripts/\n|       |-- commit-integrity-hook.sh  # PreToolUse Bash wrapper\n|       |-- epistemic-guard.sh        # PreToolUse Write/Edit blocker\n|       |-- integrity-check.sh        # Commit integrity engine (6 rules)\n|       |-- struggle-detector.sh      # Stop response analyzer\n|       |-- truth-beacon.sh           # SessionStart fact injection\n|       |-- verify-local.sh           # Local build+test runner\n|       `-- wait-for-ci.sh            # GitHub Actions monitor\n`-- README.md\n```\n\n## Results\n\n**Before (typical complex question):**\n\n- 80-120k tokens\n- Multiple back-and-forth exchanges\n- Gradually improving but unfocused answers\n- Wrong version assumptions go undetected\n\n**After (with metacognitive-guard):**\n\n- 30-40k tokens\n- Single deep analysis with verified facts\n- Structured, actionable recommendations\n- Wrong assumptions blocked or corrected\n\n**3-4x token efficiency** on complex architectural and design questions.\n\n## Why This Works\n\n1. **External detection beats self-assessment** - Claude's metacognition is imperfect.\n   External pattern matching catches struggle Claude does not notice.\n\n2. **Proactive injection beats reactive correction** - The truth beacon establishes facts BEFORE wrong beliefs form.\n\n3. **Competition increases thoroughness** - Agents try harder when told they are competing against each other.\n\n4. **Verification prevents false confidence** - Requiring actual test output eliminates \"should work\" claims.\n\n5. **Layered defense provides redundancy** - If one layer fails, others catch the error.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- **False positives** - Some hedging is appropriate epistemic humility\n- **Threshold tuning** - The 25-point threshold may need calibration for different question types\n- **Scope** - Default assertions are .NET focused; customize for other stacks\n\n## Contributing\n\nAreas of interest:\n\n- Additional signal detection patterns\n- Threshold calibration data\n- Stack-specific assertion files\n- Alternative escalation agents\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

        "plugins/hookify/README.md": "# Hookify Plugin\n\nEasily create custom hooks to prevent unwanted behaviors by analyzing conversation patterns or from explicit instructions.\n\n> **Fork Note:** This is a fork of the original Anthropic hookify plugin with **global rules support**.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe hookify plugin makes it simple to create hooks without editing complex\n`hooks.json` files. Instead, you create lightweight markdown configuration\nfiles that define patterns to watch for and messages to show when those\npatterns match.\n\n**Key features:**\n\n- 🎯 Analyze conversations to find unwanted behaviors automatically\n- 📝 Simple markdown configuration files with YAML frontmatter\n- 🔍 Regex pattern matching for powerful rules\n- 🚀 No coding required - just describe the behavior\n- 🔄 Easy enable/disable without restarting\n- 🌍 **Global rules** - rules that apply to ALL repos (new in this fork)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Create Your First Rule\n\n```bash\n/hookify Warn me when I use rm -rf commands\n```\n\nThis analyzes your request and creates `.claude/hookify.warn-rm.local.md`.\n\n### 2. Test It Immediately\n\n**No restart needed!** Rules take effect on the very next tool use.\n\nAsk Claude to run a command that should trigger the rule:\n\n```text\nRun rm -rf /tmp/test\n```\n\nYou should see the warning message immediately!\n\n## Global Rules (Fork Feature)\n\nThis fork adds support for **global rules** that apply to all repositories without copying files.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Create the global rules directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/global-rules\n```\n\n1. Add rules to `~/.claude/global-rules/hookify.*.local.md`\n\n### How It Works\n\nRules are loaded from two locations (in order):\n\n1. `.claude/hookify.*.local.md` - **Project rules** (higher priority)\n2. `~/.claude/global-rules/hookify.*.local.md` - **Global rules**\n\nProject rules with the same name override global rules.\n\n### Example: MTP Smart Test Filtering\n\n`~/.claude/global-rules/hookify.mtp-smart-test.local.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: mtp-smart-test-filtering\nenabled: true\nevent: bash\naction: block\nconditions:\n  - field: command\n    operator: regex_match\n    pattern: dotnet\\s+test\n  - field: command\n    operator: not_contains\n    pattern: --filter-\n---\n\n⚠️ **Full test suite detected - consider filtering**\n\nUse MTP filter syntax:\n- `dotnet test --filter-method \"*TestName\"`\n- `dotnet test --filter-class \"*ClassName\"`\n```\n\nThis rule applies to ALL .NET repos automatically!\n\n## Usage\n\n### Main Command: /hookify\n\n**With arguments:**\n\n```text\n/hookify Don't use console.log in TypeScript files\n```\n\nCreates a rule from your explicit instructions.\n\n**Without arguments:**\n\n```text\n/hookify\n```\n\nAnalyzes recent conversation to find behaviors you've corrected or been frustrated by.\n\n### Helper Commands\n\n**List all rules:**\n\n```text\n/hookify:list\n```\n\n**Configure rules interactively:**\n\n```text\n/hookify:configure\n```\n\nEnable/disable existing rules through an interactive interface.\n\n**Get help:**\n\n```text\n/hookify:help\n```\n\n## Rule Configuration Format\n\n### Simple Rule (Single Pattern)\n\n`.claude/hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: block-dangerous-rm\nenabled: true\nevent: bash\npattern: rm\\s+-rf\naction: block\n---\n\n⚠️ **Dangerous rm command detected!**\n\nThis command could delete important files. Please:\n- Verify the path is correct\n- Consider using a safer approach\n- Make sure you have backups\n```\n\n**Action field:**\n\n- `warn`: Shows warning but allows operation (default)\n- `block`: Prevents operation from executing (PreToolUse) or stops session (Stop events)\n\n### Advanced Rule (Multiple Conditions)\n\n`.claude/hookify.sensitive-files.local.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: warn-sensitive-files\nenabled: true\nevent: file\naction: warn\nconditions:\n  - field: file_path\n    operator: regex_match\n    pattern: \\.env$|credentials|secrets\n  - field: new_text\n    operator: contains\n    pattern: KEY\n---\n\n🔐 **Sensitive file edit detected!**\n\nEnsure credentials are not hardcoded and file is in .gitignore.\n```\n\n**All conditions must match** for the rule to trigger.\n\n## Event Types\n\n- **`bash`**: Triggers on Bash tool commands\n- **`file`**: Triggers on Edit, Write, MultiEdit tools\n- **`stop`**: Triggers when Claude wants to stop (for completion checks)\n- **`prompt`**: Triggers on user prompt submission\n- **`all`**: Triggers on all events\n\n## Pattern Syntax\n\nUse Python regex syntax:\n\n| Pattern | Matches | Example |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `rm\\s+-rf` | rm -rf | rm -rf /tmp |\n| `console\\.log\\(` | console.log( | console.log(\"test\") |\n| `(eval\\|exec)\\(` | eval( or exec( | eval(\"code\") |\n| `\\.env$` | files ending in .env | .env, .env.local |\n| `chmod\\s+777` | chmod 777 | chmod 777 file.txt |\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Use `\\s` for whitespace\n- Escape special chars: `\\.` for literal dot\n- Use `|` for OR: `(foo|bar)`\n- Use `.*` to match anything\n- Set `action: block` for dangerous operations\n- Set `action: warn` (or omit) for informational warnings\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Block Dangerous Commands\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: block-destructive-ops\nenabled: true\nevent: bash\npattern: rm\\s+-rf|dd\\s+if=|mkfs|format\naction: block\n---\n\n🛑 **Destructive operation detected!**\n\nThis command can cause data loss. Operation blocked for safety.\nPlease verify the exact path and use a safer approach.\n```\n\n**This rule blocks the operation** - Claude will not be allowed to execute these commands.\n\n### Example 2: Warn About Debug Code\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: warn-debug-code\nenabled: true\nevent: file\npattern: console\\.log\\(|debugger;|print\\(\naction: warn\n---\n\n🐛 **Debug code detected**\n\nRemember to remove debugging statements before committing.\n```\n\n**This rule warns but allows** - Claude sees the message but can still proceed.\n\n### Example 3: Require Tests Before Stopping\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: require-tests-run\nenabled: false\nevent: stop\naction: block\nconditions:\n  - field: transcript\n    operator: not_contains\n    pattern: npm test|pytest|cargo test\n---\n\n**Tests not detected in transcript!**\n\nBefore stopping, please run tests to verify your changes work correctly.\n```\n\n**This blocks Claude from stopping** if no test commands appear in the\nsession transcript. Enable only when you want strict enforcement.\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Multiple Conditions\n\nCheck multiple fields simultaneously:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: api-key-in-typescript\nenabled: true\nevent: file\nconditions:\n  - field: file_path\n    operator: regex_match\n    pattern: \\.tsx?$\n  - field: new_text\n    operator: regex_match\n    pattern: (API_KEY|SECRET|TOKEN)\\s*=\\s*[\"']\n---\n\n🔐 **Hardcoded credential in TypeScript!**\n\nUse environment variables instead of hardcoded values.\n```\n\n### Operators Reference\n\n- `regex_match`: Pattern must match (most common)\n- `contains`: String must contain pattern\n- `equals`: Exact string match\n- `not_contains`: String must NOT contain pattern\n- `starts_with`: String starts with pattern\n- `ends_with`: String ends with pattern\n\n### Field Reference\n\n**For bash events:**\n\n- `command`: The bash command string\n\n**For file events:**\n\n- `file_path`: Path to file being edited\n- `new_text`: New content being added (Edit, Write)\n- `old_text`: Old content being replaced (Edit only)\n- `content`: File content (Write only)\n\n**For prompt events:**\n\n- `user_prompt`: The user's submitted prompt text\n\n**For stop events:**\n\n- Use general matching on session state\n\n## Management\n\n### Enable/Disable Rules\n\n**Temporarily disable:**\nEdit the `.local.md` file and set `enabled: false`\n\n**Re-enable:**\nSet `enabled: true`\n\n**Or use interactive tool:**\n\n```text\n/hookify:configure\n```\n\n### Delete Rules\n\nSimply delete the `.local.md` file:\n\n```bash\nrm .claude/hookify.my-rule.local.md\n```\n\n### View All Rules\n\n```text\n/hookify:list\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is part of the Claude Code Marketplace. It should be auto-discovered when the marketplace is installed.\n\n**Manual testing:**\n\n```bash\ncc --plugin-dir /path/to/hookify\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.7+\n- No external dependencies (uses stdlib only)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Rule not triggering:**\n\n1. Check rule file exists in `.claude/` directory (in project root, not plugin directory)\n2. Verify `enabled: true` in frontmatter\n3. Test regex pattern separately\n4. Rules should work immediately - no restart needed\n5. Try `/hookify:list` to see if rule is loaded\n\n**Import errors:**\n\n- Ensure Python 3 is available: `python3 --version`\n- Check hookify plugin is installed\n\n**Pattern not matching:**\n\n- Test regex: `python3 -c \"import re; print(re.search(r'pattern', 'text'))\"`\n- Use unquoted patterns in YAML to avoid escaping issues\n- Start simple, then add complexity\n\n**Hook seems slow:**\n\n- Keep patterns simple (avoid complex regex)\n- Use specific event types (bash, file) instead of \"all\"\n- Limit number of active rules\n\n## Contributing\n\nFound a useful rule pattern? Consider sharing example files via PR!\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Severity levels (error/warning/info distinctions)\n- Rule templates library\n- Interactive pattern builder\n- Hook testing utilities\n- JSON format support (in addition to markdown)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n",
