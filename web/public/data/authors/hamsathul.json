        "README.md": "# Proposal Estimator\n\nAnalyze client RFP/BOQ packages, assess staffing gaps against company capabilities, and generate complete commercial proposals with pricing estimates for engineering consultancy services.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin automates the end-to-end proposal workflow for engineering consultancy firms bidding on infrastructure projects (water, power, roads, buildings) in the ~~region region.\n\n**Every extracted item is traced back to its source** — file name, page number, sheet, and row — so you can verify any finding against the original RFP documents.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. **Analyze RFP** — Parse client documents (PDF, Excel, Word) and extract scope by discipline, staffing requirements, and commercial terms — **with source references for every item**\n2. **Gap Analysis** — Compare RFP requirements against your staff list to identify what's available in-house, what needs hiring, and what should be subcontracted — **with RFP source traceability**\n3. **Estimate Proposal** — Apply your rate card to calculate pricing with Excel formulas, grouped by consultancy stage — **with a Source Traceability sheet linking costs to RFP requirements**\n4. **Generate Proposal** — Create a complete proposal package: Excel pricing workbook, Word report, and PowerPoint presentation — **with source references in documents and speaker notes**\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/analyze-rfp` | Reads all client documents and produces a structured RFP Analysis Summary |\n| `/gap-analysis` | Compares RFP staffing needs vs. company capabilities |\n| `/estimate-proposal` | Calculates proposal pricing using your rate card |\n| `/generate-proposal` | Creates the full proposal package (Excel + Word + PowerPoint) |\n| `/portfolio-analysis` | Cross-references RFP scope against your project portfolio and proposal pipeline — win rates, financials, and profitability scenarios |\n\n## Setup\n\n**Every command will check for required setup data before starting and will ask you to provide any missing files.** Prepare your data in the `setup/` folder using the provided templates as a guide.\n\n### Required Setup Files\n\n| File to Create | Template Provided | Description |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| `setup/org_capabilities.md` | `org_capabilities_template.md` | Copy the template, fill in your company profile, disciplines, certifications, project references, and differentiators |\n| `setup/rate_card.csv` | (includes sample rates) | Replace sample rates with your actual billing rates by staff category (hourly, ~~currency) |\n| `setup/staff_list.csv` | (includes sample staff) | Replace sample staff with your actual team — roles, disciplines, experience, availability |\n\n### Data Files (Provide Your Own Exports)\n\n| File to Provide | Template for Format | Description |\n|----------------|--------------------| -------------|\n| Projects export (`.xlsx`) | `projects_template.xlsx` | Export from your PM system — all current/past projects with contract values, actual costs, profit %, hours, and status |\n| Proposals export (`.xlsx`) | `proposals_template.xlsx` | Export from your BD system — all submitted proposals with estimated values, clients, win/loss status, and dates |\n\nPlace the projects and proposals export files in your working folder alongside the RFP documents. The plugin will prompt you for them when needed.\n\n### Setup Verification\n\nEach command runs a **Step 0: Verify Setup Data** check before doing any work. If a required file is missing or still contains only sample/template data, the command will stop and tell you exactly what's needed. You won't lose any progress — just provide the file and re-run the command.\n\n### Organization Capabilities Profile\n\nDrives the compliance check, company overview in proposals, and \"Why Choose Us\" content. Covers company profile, discipline capabilities (CORE / CAPABLE / PARTNER / NONE), sector experience, project references, certifications, software, subcontractor network, capacity, and differentiators.\n\n### Rate Card\n\nYour company billing rates. Example columns:\n\n| Category_Code | Category_Name | Department | Hourly_Rate_AED |\n|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|\n| PM-SE | PM Senior Engineer | Project Management | 750 |\n| PM-E | PM Engineer | Project Management | 400 |\n| ENG-SE | Senior Engineer | Engineering | 250 |\n| ENG-E | Engineer | Engineering | 200 |\n| ENG-JE | Junior Engineer | Engineering | 100 |\n| ENG-SD | Senior Designer | Engineering | 120 |\n| ENG-D | Designer | Engineering | 100 |\n\n### Staff List\n\nYour current team and availability. Example columns:\n\n| Name | Current_Role | Discipline | Experience_Years | Availability |\n|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Ahmed Khan | Senior PM | Project Management | 18 | Available Apr 2026 |\n| John Smith | Senior Civil Eng | Civil | 14 | Available |\n\n### Projects Export\n\nAn export of all your current and past projects.
