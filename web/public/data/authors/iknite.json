        "README.md": "# Iknite's Claude Code Marketplace\n\nA Claude Code Marketplace for some use cases that i couldn't find :)\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAdd this marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add iknite/claude-code-marketplace\n```\n\nThen browse and install individual plugins (commands or agents):\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nInstall a specific Plugin:\n```bash\n/plugin install worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace\n```\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| [worktree-context](./worktree-context/) | Bootstrap projects with **separation of concerns** between AI configuration and source code using git worktrees. Keeps `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` in a dedicated `context` branch while your project code stays clean in `main`/`master`. |\n\n### worktree-context\n\nProvides commands for managing git worktrees with a focus on AI-assisted development:\n\n- `/worktree-context:context-init` - Bootstrap a repo with the context branch methodology\n- `/worktree-context:wt-new` - Create a new worktree for a feature branch\n- `/worktree-context:wt-list` - List all worktrees\n- `/worktree-context:wt-status` - Show status of all worktrees (uncommitted changes, sync state)\n- `/worktree-context:wt-pr` - Create a GitHub PR from a worktree branch\n- `/worktree-context:wt-remove` - Clean up a worktree after merge\n",
        "worktree-context/README.md": "# Worktree Context Plugin for Claude Code\n\nA Claude Code plugin that bootstraps projects with **separation of concerns** between AI configuration and source code using git worktrees.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Project-Level (Recommended)\n\nInstall the plugin into your project's `context` branch so it's stored alongside your AI configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add iknite/claude-code-marketplace\n\n# Install to project (stored in .claude/, version controlled)\n/plugin install worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace --scope project\n```\n\nThis installs the plugin into your `context` branch's `.claude/` directory, keeping AI tooling separate from your project code.\n\n### Local-Only (Not Shared)\n\n```bash\n# Install locally (gitignored, not shared with team)\n/plugin install worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace --scope local\n```\n\n### Global Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install globally (available in all projects)\n/plugin install worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace --scope user\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\n```\n/worktree-context:wt-list\n/worktree-context:wt-status\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Bootstrap a new project\n\n```\n/worktree-context:context-init /path/to/your/repo\n```\n\nThis sets up the complete worktree structure automatically.\n\n### Daily workflow\n\n```bash\n# Check status of all worktrees\n/worktree-context:wt-status\n\n# Create a new feature branch\n/worktree-context:wt-new feature/my-feature\n\n# Work on your feature in worktree/feature/my-feature\n# ... make changes with Claude Code ...\n\n# Create a PR when ready\n/worktree-context:wt-pr feature/my-feature\n\n# Clean up after merge\n/worktree-context:wt-remove feature/my-feature --delete-branch\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/worktree-context:context-init [path]` | Bootstrap a repo with the context branch methodology |\n| `/worktree-context:wt-new <branch> [base]` | Create a new worktree (auto-detects main/master) |\n| `/worktree-context:wt-list` | List all worktrees |\n| `/worktree-context:wt-status` | Show status: uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, sync state |\n| `/worktree-context:wt-pr <branch> [base]` | Create GitHub PR from a worktree branch |\n| `/worktree-context:wt-remove <branch> [-d]` | Remove worktree, optionally delete branch |\n\n## The Methodology\n\nThis plugin creates a clean separation using **two independent git histories**:\n\n```\nbare-repo/\n└── root/\n    ├── context/              # AI configuration (CLAUDE.md, .claude/)\n    │   ├── .gitignore        # Ignores worktree/**/\n    │   └── worktree/         # All feature worktrees live here\n    │       └── feature/\n    │           └── my-feature/\n    └── main/                 # Default branch (read-only reference)\n```\n\n**Why?**\n- AI config (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`) stays in `context` branch\n- Project code stays in `main`/`master` lineage\n- Feature branches are nested inside `context` but ignored by it\n- Clean project history without AI config noise\n- Each project can have different plugins/configurations in its own `context` branch\n\n## Installation Scopes\n\n| Scope | Location | Shared | Use Case |\n|-------|----------|--------|----------|\n| `project` | `.claude/` | Yes (version controlled) | Team shares same AI config |\n| `local` | `.claude/` | No (gitignored) | Personal tweaks |\n| `user` | `~/.claude/` | No | Available everywhere |\n\n**Recommendation:** Use `--scope project` to keep the plugin in your `context` branch, maintaining the separation of concerns methodology.\n\n## Components\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Commands** (`.claude/commands/`) | Slash commands for worktree operations |\n| **Hooks** (`.claude/settings.json`) | Guardrails blocking direct edits to `root/main/` |\n| **Agent** (`.claude/agents/`) | `worktree-manager` for complex operations |\n| **Skill** (`.claude/skills/`) | Knowledge base Claude discovers automatically |\n\n## Plugin Management\n\n```bash\n# Update the plugin\n/plugin update worktree-context\n\n# Disable temporarily\n/plugin disable worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace\n\n# Uninstall\n/plugin uninstall worktree-context@iknite-cc-marketplace\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Commands not showing up?**\n- Run `/plugin` to check installation status\n- Try `/plugin update worktree-context`\n\n**Need complex worktree operations?**\nAsk Claude: \"Use the worktree-manager agent to help me...\"\n\n---\nwith <3 @iknite\n"
