pattern:\n\n```typescript\n// feature.ts - FLAT structure, DIRECT imports, NO hooks\nimport MyComponent from './components/MyComponent'\nimport { myService } from './services/myService'\n\nexport default {\n  MyComponent,  // PascalCase = component (stub renders null)\n  myService,    // camelCase = service (undefined when not ready)\n  // NO hooks! Hooks go in index.ts\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-Chain\n\nAlways pair chainId with safeAddress:\n\n```typescript\n// CORRECT\nconst safeKey = `${chainId}:${safeAddress}`\nfunction getSafe(chainId: string, safeAddress: string) { ... }\n\n// WRONG - NEVER do this\nfunction getSafe(safeAddress: string) { ... }  // Missing chainId!\n```\n\n### Redux Testing\n\nTest state changes, not action dispatches:\n\n```typescript\n// CORRECT - Test actual state\nconst state = store.getState()\nexpect(state.safes[`${chainId}:${safeAddress}`]).toEqual(safeInfo)\n\n// WRONG - Only tests action was called\nexpect(dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(setSafe(safeInfo))\n```\n\n### Type Safety\n\nNEVER use `any`:\n\n```typescript\n// WRONG\nconst data: any = await fetchData()\n\n// CORRECT\nconst data: SafeInfo = await fetchData<SafeInfo>()\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n```bash\n# Web App\nyarn workspace @safe-global/web type-check\nyarn workspace @safe-global/web lint\nyarn workspace @safe-global/web test\nyarn workspace @safe-global/web cypress:run\n\n# Mobile App\nyarn workspace @safe-global/mobile type-check\nyarn workspace @safe-global/mobile lint\nyarn workspace @safe-global/mobile test\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThis plugin is based on the [compound-engineering plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) created by [Kieran Klaassen](https://github.com/kieranklaassen) at [EveryInc](https://every.to). The original plugin provides a powerful framework for AI-assisted engineering workflows.\n\nWe have adapted it for Safe-wallet specific patterns including:\n- Feature architecture with lazy-loading\n- Multi-chain validation (chainId + safeAddress)\n- Safe SDK integration patterns\n- Redux testing patterns\n- TypeScript strict type safety\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier - not harder.**\n\nThis is the core principle of compound engineering. By documenting learnings, following consistent patterns, and using AI-assisted workflows, we make the codebase easier to work with over time, not harder.\n\n## License\n\nMIT - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\n---\n\n**Learn more about compound engineering:**\n- [Compound engineering: how Every codes with agents](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents)\n- [The story behind compounding engineering](https://every.to/source-code/my-ai-had-already-fixed-the-code-before-i-saw-it)\n"
