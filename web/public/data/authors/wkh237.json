        "plugins/tmux-team/commands/learn.md": "---\nallowed-tools: Read(*), Bash(tmux-team:*)\ndescription: Learn how to use tmux-team for multi-agent coordination\n---\n\nYou need to learn how to use tmux-team, a CLI tool for coordinating multiple AI agents running in different tmux panes.\n\n## What is tmux-team?\n\ntmux-team enables AI agents (like Claude, Codex, Gemini) running in separate terminal panes to communicate with each other. Think of it as a messaging system for terminal-based AI agents.\n\n## Core Concept\n\nEach agent runs in its own tmux pane. When you want to talk to another agent:\n1. Your message is pasted via a tmux buffer\n2. tmux-team waits briefly, then sends Enter to submit\n3. You read their response by capturing their pane output\n\n## Essential Commands (use --wait for better token utilization)\n\n```bash\n# List available agents in this project\ntmux-team list\n\n# Send and wait for response (recommended)\ntmux-team talk <agent> \"<message>\" --wait\n\n# Broadcast to all agents\ntmux-team talk all \"<message>\" --wait\n```\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n### Quick question to another agent\n```bash\ntmux-team talk codex \"What's the status of the authentication refactor?\" --wait\n# Response is returned directly\n```\n\n### Delegate a task with longer timeout and more output\n```bash\ntmux-team talk codex \"Please implement the login form. Reply when done.\" --wait --timeout 300 --lines 200\n```\n\n### Broadcast to all agents\n```bash\ntmux-team talk all \"Sync: PR #123 was merged, please pull latest\" --wait\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\ntmux-team is configured via tmux-team.json in your project root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$config\": {\n    \"mode\": \"polling\",\n    \"pasteEnterDelayMs\": 500\n  },\n  \"codex\": { \"pane\": \"%1\", \"remark\": \"OpenAI Codex agent\" },\n  \"gemini\": { \"pane\": \"%2\", \"remark\": \"Google Gemini agent\" },\n  \"claude\": { \"pane\": \"%3\", \"remark\": \"Anthropic Claude agent\" }\n}\n```\n\nTo find your pane ID, run: tmux display-message -p '#{pane_id}'\n\n## If --wait Times Out\n\nIf the agent takes longer than expected, --wait will timeout. Use the check command to retrieve the response later:\n\n```bash\n# Check for response after timeout (default 100 lines)\ntmux-team check <agent>\n\n# Check with more lines for long responses\ntmux-team check <agent> 200\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use --wait** - More token-efficient than polling with check command\n2. **Be explicit** - Tell the other agent exactly what you need and how to respond\n3. **Set timeout appropriately** - Use --timeout 300 for complex tasks\n4. **Use --lines for long responses** - Default is 100 lines, increase for verbose output\n5. **If timeout occurs** - Use \"tmux-team check <agent> [lines]\" to retrieve the response\n6. **Broadcast sparingly** - Only use \"talk all\" for announcements everyone needs\n\n## Your Next Step\n\nRun tmux-team list to see which agents are available in your current project.\n",
        "plugins/tmux-team/commands/team.md": "---\nallowed-tools: Bash(tmux-team:*)\ndescription: Talk to peer agents in different tmux panes\n---\n\nYou are working in a multi-agent tmux environment with other AI agents running in different tmux panes. The user wants you to coordinate with them.\n\n## Your Task\n\nInterpret the user's request: $ARGUMENTS\n\nBased on what the user wants, use the tmux-team CLI to coordinate with other agents.\n\n## How to Coordinate\n\nTo send a message to an agent and wait for their response:\n  tmux-team talk <agent> \"<message>\" --wait\n\nTo broadcast to all agents:\n  tmux-team talk all \"<message>\" --wait\n\nTo see available agents:\n  tmux-team list\n\n## Examples\n\nUser says: \"tell codex to review the auth module\"\nYou run: tmux-team talk codex \"Please review the auth module and share your findings\" --wait\n\nUser says: \"ask gemini about the test coverage\"\nYou run: tmux-team talk gemini \"What is the current test coverage status?\" --wait\n\nUser says: \"let everyone know we are starting the refactor\"\nYou run: tmux-team talk all \"Starting the refactor now. Please hold off on conflicting changes.\" --wait\n\n## Options\n\nFor long responses, increase timeout and lines captured:\n\n  tmux-team talk <agent> \"<message>\" --wait --timeout 300 --lines 200\n\n## If --wait Times Out\n\nUse the check command to retrieve the response with an optional line count:\n\n  tmux-team check <agent>\n  tmux-team check <agent> 200\n\n## Important\n\n- Always use --wait flag for better token efficiency\n- Craft clear, specific messages for the other agent\n- After receiving a response, summarize it for the user\n",

Use this skill when you need to delegate tasks, request reviews, or collaborate with agents like Codex, Gemini, or other Claude instances.\n---\n\n# Multi-Agent Coordination with tmux-team\n\nYou are working in a multi-agent tmux environment. Use the `tmux-team` CLI to communicate with other AI agents running in different panes.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Delegating specialized tasks to other agents (e.g., \"Ask Codex to review this code\")\n- Broadcasting messages to all agents\n- Checking responses from agents you've messaged\n- Coordinating parallel work across multiple agents\n\n## Commands (use --wait for better token utilization)\n\n```bash\n# Send and wait for response (recommended)\ntmux-team talk codex \"your message\" --wait\ntmux-team talk gemini \"your message\" --wait --timeout 120\n\n# Broadcast to all agents\ntmux-team talk all \"message for everyone\" --wait\n\n# List configured agents\ntmux-team list\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\nThe `--wait` flag blocks until the agent responds, returning the response directly:\n\n```bash\ntmux-team talk codex \"Review this authentication code\" --wait\n# Response is returned directly - no need for a separate check command\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Always use `--wait`** - it's more token-efficient than polling with `check`\n- Use `--timeout 300` for complex tasks that need more time\n- Use `--delay 5` to add delay between messages (rate limiting)\n- Run `tmux-team learn` for a comprehensive guide\n"
