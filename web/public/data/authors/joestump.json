The plugin's 14 skills will be available as `/design:init`, `/design:prime`, `/design:adr`, `/design:spec`, `/design:plan`, `/design:organize`, `/design:enrich`, `/design:work`, `/design:check`, `/design:audit`, `/design:discover`, `/design:docs`, `/design:list`, and `/design:status`.\n\n## Development\n\nClone the repo and run Claude Code from the project directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/joestump/claude-plugin-design.git\ncd claude-plugin-design\nclaude\n```\n\nThe `.claude/settings.json` in this repo registers the local directory as a marketplace and enables the plugin automatically. Any changes to skills or templates are picked up on the next Claude Code launch.\n\n## What It Does\n\n### `/design:adr` -- Architecture Decision Records\n\nCreates ADRs using [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format:\n- Sequential numbering: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, etc.\n- Stored in `docs/adrs/`\n- Mermaid architecture diagrams included by default\n- YAML frontmatter with status, date, decision-makers\n- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based drafting with architect review\n- Offers to add an Architecture Context section to your CLAUDE.md on first use\n- After writing, suggests formalizing the decision into a spec with `/design:spec`\n\n### `/design:spec` -- Specifications\n\nCreates paired spec.md + design.md using [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec):\n- Spec numbering: `SPEC-0001`, `SPEC-0002`, etc.\n- Requirements in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) format (MUST, SHALL, MAY, etc.)\n- Scenarios with `####` headings and WHEN/THEN format\n- Mermaid architecture diagrams required in design.md\n- Stored in `docs/openspec/specs/{capability-name}/`\n- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based drafting with architect review\n- **Sprint planning**: After writing the spec, offers to break requirements into trackable issues:\n  - Detects [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Jira, or Linear (MCP or CLI)\n  - Saves tracker preference to `.design.json` for future use\n  - Creates epics, tasks, and sub-tasks with acceptance criteria referencing spec/requirement numbers\n  - Sets up dependency relationships between tasks\n  - Falls back to generating `tasks.md` as a co-located openspec artifact when no tracker is available (per ADR-0007)\n  - For planning against existing specs, use `/design:plan` instead\n\n### `/design:plan` -- Sprint Planning\n\nBreaks an existing specification into trackable work items in your issue tracker:\n- Accepts a spec name or SPEC number (e.g., `/design:plan web-dashboard` or `/design:plan SPEC-0003`)\n- Lists available specs interactively if no argument provided\n- Detects available issue trackers:\n  - [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), GitHub (MCP or `gh` CLI), GitLab (MCP or `glab` CLI), Gitea (MCP or `tea` CLI), Jira (MCP), Linear (MCP)\n  - Saves tracker preference to `.design.json` so you're not re-prompted\n- Creates epics, tasks, and sub-tasks with acceptance criteria referencing spec/requirement numbers\n- Sets up dependency relationships between tasks\n- Project grouping: creates tracker-native projects for each epic (or a single combined project with `--project`). Projects are automatically linked to the repository so they appear in the repo's Projects tab. Skip with `--no-projects`.\n- Branch naming: adds `### Branch` sections to issue bodies with `feature/{issue-number}-{slug}` naming convention. Customize prefix with `--branch-prefix`, skip with `--no-branches`.\n- PR conventions: adds `### PR Convention` sections with tracker-specific close keywords (e.g., `Closes #N` for GitHub)\n- Falls back to generating `tasks.md` when no tracker is available (per ADR-0007)\n- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based planning with reviewer\n\n### `/design:organize` -- Organize Issues into Projects\n\nRetroactively groups existing issues into tracker-native projects:\n- Finds issues referencing a spec in your tracker\n- Creates one project per epic (default) or a single combined project (`--project`)\n- Automatically links projects to the repository so they appear in the repo's Projects tab\n- Skips projects that already exist (idempotent)\n- Use `--dry-run` to preview without creating\n- No `--review` support (utility skill)\n\n### `/design:enrich` -- Enrich Issues with Workflow Conventions\n\nRetroactively adds branch naming and PR convention sections to existing issue bodies:\n- Finds issues referencing a spec in your tracker\n- Appends `### Branch` sections with `feature/{issue-number}-{slug}` naming\n- Appends `### PR Convention` sections with tracker-specific close keywords\n- Skips issues that already have these sections (idempotent)\n- Use `--dry-run` to preview without modifying\n- Custom branch prefix via `--branch-prefix`\n- No `--review` support (utility skill)\n\n### `/design:work` -- Parallel Issue Implementation\n\nPicks up tracker issues and implements them in parallel using git worktrees:\n- Accepts a spec number (`SPEC-0003`) to work all open issues, or specific issue numbers (`42 43 47`)\n- Reads spec.md, design.md, and referenced ADRs to give workers full architecture context\n- Detects tracker using the same pattern as `/design:plan` (`.design.json` preference, then auto-detection)\n- Filters issues: skips epics and issues without `### Branch` sections (suggests `/design:enrich`)\n- Extracts branch names and PR conventions from issue bodies\n- Creates isolated git worktrees for each issue with deterministic branch names\n- Spawns parallel worker agents (default 3, configurable with `--max-agents`)\n- Workers implement changes, leave `// Governing: SPEC-XXXX REQ \"...\"` comments, run tests, commit, push, and create PRs\n- Draft PRs by default; use `--ready` for non-draft PRs\n- `--dry-run` previews what would happen without doing anything\n- `--no-tests` skips test execution in workers\n- Failed issues preserve their worktrees for manual pickup\n- Falls back to single-agent sequential mode if team creation fails\n- Configurable via `.design.json` `worktrees` section (base_dir, max_agents, auto_cleanup, pr_mode)\n\n### `/design:init` -- Initialize Design Plugin\n\nSets up your project's `CLAUDE.md` with architecture context:\n- Creates `CLAUDE.md` if it doesn't exist, or updates the existing one\n- Adds an `## Architecture Context` section with references to `docs/adrs/` and `docs/openspec/specs/`\n- Includes a skills reference table and a note about `/design:prime`\n- Idempotent -- safe to re-run without duplicating content\n\n### `/design:prime` -- Prime Architecture Context\n\nLoads existing ADRs and specs into the session for architecture-aware responses:\n- Summarizes all ADRs (title, status, key decision) and specs (title, status, requirement counts)\n- Optional topic argument for semantic filtering (e.g., `/design:prime security` surfaces auth, encryption, access control decisions)\n- Suggests `/design:init` if CLAUDE.md hasn't been set up yet\n- Read-only -- never modifies any files\n\n### `/design:check` -- Quick Drift Check\n\nFast, focused drift check on a specific target:\n- Target can be a file path, directory, `ADR-XXXX`, or `SPEC-XXXX`\n- Checks 3 drift categories: code vs. spec, code vs. ADR, ADR vs. spec\n- Produces a concise findings table with severity levels (critical, warning, info)\n- Always single-agent (no `--review` support)\n- Suggests `/design:audit` for deeper analysis when warranted\n\n### `/design:audit` -- Comprehensive Design Audit\n\nDeep audit of design artifact alignment across the project:\n- Covers all 6 drift categories: code vs. spec, code vs. ADR, ADR vs. spec, coverage gaps, stale artifacts, policy violations\n- Produces a structured report with categorized findings and summary matrix\n- Prioritized recommended actions ordered by severity\n- Single-agent by default; add `--review` for team-based auditing with auditor and reviewer agents\n\n### `/design:discover` -- Codebase Discovery\n\nReverse-engineers implicit architectural decisions and spec-worthy subsystems from an existing codebase:\n- Analyzes dependencies, architectural patterns, project structure, and infrastructure configuration\n- Uses parallel exploration agents for fast analysis of large codebases\n- Produces a suggestion report with confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) and evidence citations\n- Includes ready-to-use `/design:adr` and `/design:spec` commands for each suggestion\n- Reads existing ADRs and specs to avoid suggesting duplicates\n- Optional scope argument to limit analysis to a subdirectory or domain\n- Read-only -- never creates files; you choose what to formalize\n\n### `/design:docs` -- Docusaurus Documentation Site\n\nTransforms your ADRs and specs into a polished doc site with two modes:\n\n**Scaffold mode** (default when no existing site): Creates a standalone `docs-site/` with its own Docusaurus installation.\n\n**Integration mode** (when an existing Docusaurus site is detected): Generates a `sync-design-docs` build-time plugin into the existing site's `plugins/` directory, copies React components and CSS, and registers everything automatically. The plugin runs the same transforms at build time and watches for source changes during development.\n\n**Upgrade lifecycle**: Re-running `/design:docs` on an already-configured project triggers a safe upgrade flow:\n- A `.design-docs.json` manifest tracks plugin version, mode, site directory, and SHA-256 checksums of all managed files\n- Unchanged files are updated silently to the latest template version\n- Modified files prompt you with a diff and three choices: accept new version, keep yours, or opt out of future upgrades for that file\n- Missing files are re-created from templates\n- Files marked `managed: false` are permanently skipped\n\nFeatures (both modes):\n- RFC 2119 keyword highlighting (color-coded MUST/SHALL/MAY)\n- Cross-reference linking (ADR-0001 and SPEC-NNN become clickable links)\n- Mermaid diagram rendering\n- Status/Date/Domain badge components\n- Requirement box components with anchor links\n- Consequence keyword highlighting (Good/Bad/Neutral)\n- Dark mode support\n- Auto-generated sidebars\n- Separate spec/design pages with expandable sidebar categories\n- Specs overview index with linked table of all specifications\n\n### `/design:list` -- List Decisions and Specs\n\nLists all ADRs and specs with their status, date, and title. Filter by type with `adr`, `spec`, or `all`.\n\n### `/design:status` -- Update Status\n\nChanges the status of an ADR or spec. Valid statuses:\n- **ADR**: proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded\n- **Spec**: draft, review, approved, implemented, deprecated\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Scaffold mode (new docs site)\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .design-docs.json            # Upgrade manifest (version, checksums)\n├── docs/\n│   ├── adrs/                    # ADRs (created by /design:adr)\n│   │   ├── ADR-0001-short-title.md\n│   │   └── ADR-0002-short-title.md\n│   └── openspec/specs/          # Specs (created by /design:spec)\n│       └── capability-name/\n│           ├── spec.md\n│           └── design.md\n├── docs-site/                   # Docusaurus site (created by /design:docs)\n│   ├── package.json\n│   ├── docusaurus.config.ts\n│   ├── scripts/                 # Build-time transforms\n│   └── src/                     # Components, CSS, data\n└── docs-generated/              # Build artifact (generated by docs-site build)\n    ├── index.mdx\n    ├── decisions/               # Transformed ADRs\n    └── specs/                   # Transformed specs\n        ├── index.mdx            # Overview table with links\n        ├── capability-name/     # Expandable sidebar category\n        │   ├── _category_.json\n        │   ├── spec.mdx\n        │   └── design.mdx\n        └── single-doc-spec.mdx  # Leaf item (no design.md)\n```\n\n### Integration mode (existing Docusaurus site)\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .design-docs.json            # Upgrade manifest (version, checksums)\n├── docs/\n│   ├── adrs/                    # ADRs (canonical source)\n│   └── openspec/specs/          # Specs (canonical source)\n└── website/                     # Your existing Docusaurus site\n    ├── docusaurus.config.ts     # Plugin registered here\n    ├── plugins/\n    │   └── sync-design-docs/    # Generated by /design:docs\n    │       ├── index.js         # Docusaurus plugin entry\n    │       └── lib/             # Transform scripts\n    ├── src/\n    │   ├── components/\n    │   │   └── design-docs/     # Badge and layout components\n    │   ├── css/\n    │   │   └── design-docs.css  # Design-specific styles\n    │   └── theme/\n    │       └── MDXComponents.tsx # Component registration (merged)\n    └── docs/\n        └── architecture/        # Generated at build time (gitignored)\n            ├── index.mdx\n            ├── decisions/       # Transformed ADRs\n            └── specs/           # Transformed specs\n                ├── index.mdx    # Overview table with links\n                └── ...          # Same structure as scaffold\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Setup**: `/design:init` to configure CLAUDE.md with architecture context\n2. **Discover**: `/design:discover` to find implicit decisions in an existing codebase\n3. **Prime**: `/design:prime` at the start of each session (or `/design:prime security` for a focused topic)\n4. **Decide**: `/design:adr We need to choose a web framework for the admin dashboard`\n5. **Review**: `/design:list adr` to see all decisions, `/design:status ADR-0001 accepted` to approve\n6. **Specify**: `/design:spec Convert ADR-0001 to a spec` — the agent writes requirements and offers to plan a sprint\n7. **Plan**: `/design:plan SPEC-0001` — break the spec into epics, tasks, and sub-tasks in Beads, GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Jira, or Linear with acceptance criteria referencing spec/requirement numbers\n8. **Organize & Enrich** (retroactive): `/design:organize SPEC-0001` to group issues into projects, `/design:enrich SPEC-0001` to add branch and PR conventions\n9. **Build**: `/design:work SPEC-0001` to pick up issues and implement them in parallel using git worktrees, or `/design:prime` then manually work through issues\n10. **Check**: `/design:check src/auth/` to quick-check for drift while coding\n11. **Audit**: `/design:audit --review` for a comprehensive design review\n12. **Document**: `/design:docs` to generate or upgrade the docs site\n\nFor thorough team review on critical decisions, add `--review`:\n- `/design:adr Choose a database --review`\n- `/design:spec authentication-service --review`\n- `/design:audit --review`\n\n## CLAUDE.md Integration\n\nRun `/design:init` to set up your project's CLAUDE.md with architecture context.
