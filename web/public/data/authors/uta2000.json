        "README.md": "# spec-driven\n\nA Claude Code plugin that enforces discipline across the feature development lifecycle — from design through implementation to verification. Context-aware: adapts to your platform (web, iOS, Android) and tech stack (Supabase, Next.js, React Native, etc.).\n\n## The Problem\n\nFeatures get brainstormed, then jump straight to code. Halfway through, you discover schema constraints that don't match, types that need changing, pipeline assumptions that break. A 2-hour feature becomes a 6-hour debugging session.\n\n## The Solution\n\nSix skills and an orchestrator that cover the full feature development lifecycle. Catch conflicts when they're cheap to fix — a line edit in a design doc instead of a code rewrite.\n\nspec-driven handles the **design and verification** phases. For **implementation and delivery**, it delegates to the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin — brainstorming, TDD, code review, worktrees, and PRs.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI\n- [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin (required companion — handles brainstorming, implementation planning, TDD, code review, worktrees, and PR workflow)\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the marketplace\n\n```bash\n# Install superpowers first (if not already installed)\nclaude plugins add superpowers\n\n# Install spec-driven\nclaude plugins add spec-driven\n```\n\n### From GitHub\n\n```bash\n# Install superpowers first (if not already installed)\nclaude plugins add https://github.com/obra/superpowers\n\n# Install spec-driven\nclaude plugins add https://github.com/uta2000/spec-driven\n```\n\n### Per-project (manual)\n\nCopy the `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, and `references/` directories into your project's `.claude/` directory. You still need the superpowers plugin installed separately.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAfter installing, open any project and tell Claude:\n\n```\nstart feature: add user notifications\n```\n\nspec-driven will:\n1. Scan your project files and auto-detect your platform and tech stack\n2. Create a `.spec-driven.yml` with your project context (first time only)\n3. Classify the scope (quick fix → major feature)\n4. Walk you through the right steps — brainstorm, design, verify, implement, ship\n\nThe lifecycle adds ~20-30 minutes of upfront design but typically saves 2-4 hours of mid-implementation debugging per feature.\n\nFor a quick fix, just say what's broken — the lifecycle is 4 steps: understand, fix (TDD), verify, PR.\n\n## How It Works with Superpowers\n\nspec-driven owns the design and verification phases. superpowers owns implementation and delivery. The `start-feature` orchestrator invokes both:\n\n| Lifecycle Step | Plugin | Skill |\n|---------------|--------|-------|\n| Brainstorm | superpowers | `brainstorming` |\n| Spike / PoC | **spec-driven** | `spike` |\n| Design document | **spec-driven** | `design-document` |\n| Design verification | **spec-driven** | `design-verification` |\n| Create issue | **spec-driven** | `create-issue` |\n| Implementation plan | superpowers | `writing-plans` |\n| Verify plan criteria | **spec-driven** | `verify-plan-criteria` |\n| Worktree setup | superpowers | `using-git-worktrees` |\n| Implement (TDD) | superpowers | `test-driven-development` |\n| Code review | superpowers | `requesting-code-review` |\n| Final verification | **spec-driven** + superpowers | `verify-acceptance-criteria` + `verification-before-completion` |\n| Commit and PR | superpowers | `finishing-a-development-branch` |\n\n## Skills\n\n### Lifecycle Orchestrator\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `start-feature` | Orchestrates the full lifecycle from idea to PR — classifies scope, loads project context, builds the platform-aware step list, and invokes the right skill at each stage |\n\n### Pre-Implementation (Design Phase)\n\n| Skill | Step | Purpose |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| `spike` | 3 | De-risk technical unknowns with time-boxed experiments before committing to a design |\n| `design-document` | 4 | Turn brainstorming decisions into structured, implementable design docs |\n| `design-verification` | 5 | Verify a design against the actual codebase — schema, types, pipelines, routes, dependencies, plus stack and platform-specific checks |\n| `create-issue` | 6 | Create well-structured GitHub issues from verified designs |\n\n### Post-Implementation (Verification Phase)\n\n| Skill | Step | Purpose |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| `verify-plan-criteria` | 8 | Validate every task has machine-verifiable acceptance criteria, auto-draft missing ones |\n| `verify-acceptance-criteria` | 12 | Mechanically check each criterion against the codebase before claiming work is done |\n\n### Agent\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `task-verifier` | Runs PASS/FAIL/CANNOT_VERIFY checks with evidence |\n\n## Using Skills Standalone\n\nWhile `start-feature` is the recommended entry point, you can invoke any skill directly:\n\n```\nrun design-verification on docs/plans/2024-03-15-notifications-design.md\n```\n\n```\nrun verify-acceptance-criteria against the plan in docs/plans/\n```\n\nSkills that need project context (`design-verification`, `spike`) will auto-create `.spec-driven.yml` if it doesn't exist (same auto-discovery flow as `start-feature`). Other skills like `verify-plan-criteria` and `verify-acceptance-criteria` work without it.\n\n## Where These Fit in the Lifecycle\n\n```\n 1. Idea\n 2. Brainstorming                  ← superpowers:brainstorming\n 3. Spike / PoC                    ← spike\n 4. Design Document                ← design-document\n 5.

Deploy\n```\n\n## Hooks\n\n| Hook | Trigger | Action |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| SessionStart | Every session | Injects spec-driven conventions into context |\n| PostToolUse (Write) | Plan file written to `plans/*.md` | Reminds to run `verify-plan-criteria` |\n| Stop | Session ending | Blocks if code was implemented without running `verify-acceptance-criteria` |\n\n## Project Context\n\nspec-driven uses a `.spec-driven.yml` file in your project root for platform and stack-specific behavior. **You don't need to create this manually** — `start-feature` auto-detects your platform and stack from project files (package.json, Gemfile, go.mod, config files, directory structure, etc.) and creates it for you on first run.\n\n```yaml\n# .spec-driven.yml (auto-generated, then curated)\nplatform: web          # web | ios | android | cross-platform\nstack:\n  - supabase\n  - next-js\n  - vercel\ngotchas:\n  - \"PostgREST caps all queries at 1000 rows without .range() pagination\"\n```\n\n**Should you commit this file?** Yes — `.spec-driven.yml` should be committed to your repo. It captures project-specific knowledge (especially gotchas) that benefits the whole team. It's not sensitive data and evolves with the project.\n\n**How it works:**\n- `platform` adjusts the lifecycle — mobile adds beta testing, app store review, required feature flags\n- `stack` loads stack-specific verification checks during design verification\n- `gotchas` are injected into every verification — project-specific pitfalls learned from past bugs\n\n**Auto-discovery:** On first run, `start-feature` scans your project files and presents detected context for confirmation. On subsequent runs, it cross-checks for new dependencies and suggests additions.\n\n**Gotcha write-back:** When `design-verification` finds a reusable pitfall or `spike` discovers a denied assumption that could affect future features, the skill offers to add it to your gotchas list automatically. The file gets smarter over time without manual curation.\n\n### Pre-Built Stack References\n\n| Stack | Checks |\n|-------|--------|\n| `supabase` | PostgREST 1000-row limit, RLS policies, migration safety, Edge Function limits |\n| `next-js` | Server/client boundaries, route conflicts, env variable exposure, middleware |\n| `react-native` | Native bridge compat, Hermes engine, platform-specific code, app store compliance |\n| `vercel` | Serverless limits, Edge Function constraints, build time, cold starts |\n\n**Unknown stacks:** If no pre-built reference exists, skills research gotchas dynamically via web search and the project's own documentation.\n\n### Platform Lifecycle Differences\n\n| Step | Web | Mobile |\n|------|-----|--------|\n| Feature flags | Recommended | Required |\n| API contract testing | Good practice | Required |\n| Migration dry-run | Recommended | Required |\n| Beta testing | Preview deploy | TestFlight / Play Console (added step) |\n| App store review | N/A | Required gate (added step) |\n| Rollback | Revert deploy | Feature flag kill switch + multi-version compat |\n| Device testing | Browser testing | OS + device + screen matrix |\n\n## Example: Design Verification in Action\n\nA design for a \"Creative Domain Generator\" was verified against the codebase before any code was written. The verification caught 5 issues:\n\n| Finding | What would have happened |\n|---------|------------------------|\n| `keyword_phrase` is NOT NULL | Runtime crash when inserting creative results without a keyword |\n| `service_id` / `location_id` are required FKs | Insert fails for freeform creative searches |\n| `format` CHECK constraint | DB rejects rows without `location_service` or `service_location` |\n| Pipeline hook assumes mechanical generation | Hook crashes when called without service/location IDs |\n| Results page assumes non-null relations | UI crash rendering creative search results |\n\nEach would have been 30-60 minutes of debugging mid-implementation. Total time saved: 3-4 hours.\n\n## Example: Project Gotchas Preventing Repeat Bugs\n\nAfter discovering Supabase's PostgREST 1000-row silent truncation bug (21+ queries affected, zero error signals), the team added it to `.spec-driven.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ngotchas:\n  - \"PostgREST caps all queries at 1000 rows without .range() pagination — causes silent data truncation with 200 OK\"\n```\n\nEvery future design verification now automatically checks: \"Does any new query expect >1,000 rows without pagination?\" The bug that took hours to diagnose becomes a checklist item that takes seconds to verify.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Format\n\n```markdown\n### Task N: [Title]\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] File exists at `src/components/Badge.tsx`\n- [ ] Component exports `Badge` as named export\n- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with no new errors\n- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no new warnings\n- [ ] [MANUAL] Badge renders red when condition is met\n\n**Files:**\n...\n```\n\nCriteria prefixed with `[MANUAL]` are flagged for human review rather than failing verification.\n\n## Verification Report\n\n```\n| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |\n|---|-----------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | File exists at src/... | PASS | Found at expected path, 38 lines |\n| 2 | typecheck passes | PASS | 0 errors |\n| 3 | Badge renders red | CANNOT_VERIFY | Requires visual/runtime test |\n\nVerdict: VERIFIED (2/3 pass, 1 requires manual verification)\n```\n\n## Contributing Stack References\n\nTo add support for a new tech stack:\n\n1.
