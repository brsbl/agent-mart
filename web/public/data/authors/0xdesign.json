        "README.md": "# Design and Refine\n\nA Claude Code plugin that helps you make confident UI design decisions through rapid iteration.\n\n## What It Does\n\nDesign and Refine generates multiple distinct UI variations for any component or page, lets you compare them side-by-side in your browser, collects your feedback on what you like about each, and synthesizes a refined version—repeating until you're confident in the result.\n\nInstead of guessing at the right design or going back-and-forth on revisions, you see real options, pick what works, and iterate quickly.\n\n## When to Use It\n\n- **Starting a new component or page** — explore different approaches before committing\n- **Redesigning existing UI** — see alternatives to what you have today\n- **Stuck on a design direction** — generate options when you're not sure what you want\n- **Getting stakeholder buy-in** — show concrete variations instead of describing ideas\n- **Learning what works** — see how different layouts, densities, and patterns feel in your actual codebase\n\n## Why Use It\n\n1. **Uses your existing design system** — infers colors, typography, spacing from your Tailwind config, CSS variables, or component library\n2. **Generates real code** — not mockups, actual working components in your framework\n3. **Side-by-side comparison** — view all variations at `/__design_lab` in your dev server\n4. **Iterative refinement** — tell it what you like about each, get a synthesized version\n5. **Clean handoff** — outputs `DESIGN_PLAN.md` with implementation steps when you're done\n6. **No mess left behind** — automatically cleans up all temporary files\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n### 1. Add the marketplace\n\nIn Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add 0xdesign/design-plugin\n```\n\n### 2. Install the plugin\n\n```\n/plugin install design-and-refine@design-plugins\n```\n\nThat's it. The plugin is now available in any project.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Start a session\n\n```\n/design-and-refine:start\n```\n\nOr with a specific target:\n\n```\n/design-and-refine:start ProfileCard\n```\n\n### What happens next\n\n1. **Preflight** — detects your framework (Next.js, Vite, etc.) and styling system (Tailwind, MUI, etc.)\n\n2. **Style inference** — reads your existing design tokens from Tailwind config, CSS variables, or theme files\n\n3. **Interview** — asks about:\n   - What you're designing (component vs page, new vs redesign)\n   - Pain points and what should improve\n   - Visual and interaction inspiration\n   - Target user and key tasks\n\n4. **Generation** — creates 5 distinct variations exploring different:\n   - Information hierarchy\n   - Layout models (cards, lists, tables, split-pane)\n   - Density (compact vs spacious)\n   - Interaction patterns (modal, inline, drawer)\n   - Visual expression\n\n5. **Review** — open `http://localhost:3000/__design_lab` (or your dev server port) to see all variations side-by-side\n\n6. **Feedback** — use the interactive feedback overlay or describe what you like:\n   - Click **\"Add Feedback\"** to enter feedback mode\n   - Click any element to leave a comment (Figma-style)\n   - Click **\"Submit Feedback\"** to copy to clipboard, then paste in terminal\n   - Or just describe what you like about each variation in chat\n\n7. **Iterate** — repeat until you're confident\n\n8. **Finalize** — all temp files are deleted, `DESIGN_PLAN.md` is generated with implementation steps\n\n### Clean up manually (if needed)\n\n```\n/design-and-refine:cleanup\n```\n\n---\n\n## Supported Frameworks\n\n- Next.js (App Router & Pages Router)\n- Vite (React, Vue)\n- Remix\n- Astro\n- Create React App\n\n## Supported Styling\n\n- Tailwind CSS\n- CSS Modules\n- Material UI (MUI)\n- Chakra UI\n- Ant Design\n- styled-components\n- Emotion\n\n---\n\n## Interactive Feedback\n\nThe Design Lab includes a Figma-style feedback overlay for precise comments:\n\n1. **Enter feedback mode** — click the \"💬 Add Feedback\" button (bottom-right)\n2. **Click any element** — a comment panel appears near your click\n3. **Type your feedback** — \"Make this button larger\" or \"Love this spacing\"\n4. **Save** — click Save or press ⌘+Enter\n5. **Repeat** — add comments to multiple elements across different variants\n6. **Submit** — fill in \"Overall Direction\" and click \"Submit Feedback\"\n7. **Paste** — the formatted feedback is copied to clipboard, paste it in your terminal\n\nClaude receives structured feedback with element selectors, so it knows exactly which elements you're referring to.\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n**Be specific in the interview.** The more context you give about pain points, target users, and inspiration, the more distinct and useful the variations will be.\n\n**Reference products you admire.** \"Like Linear's density\" or \"Stripe's clarity\" gives Claude concrete direction.\n\n**Don't settle on round one.** The synthesis step is where it gets good—describe what you like about each variant and let it combine them.\n\n**Keep your dev server running.** The plugin won't start it for you (that would block). Just have it running in another terminal.\n\n**Check the DESIGN_PLAN.md.** After finalizing, this file contains the implementation steps, component API, accessibility checklist, and testing guidance.\n\n---\n\n## What Gets Created (Temporarily)\n\nDuring the session:\n- `.claude-design/` — variants, previews, design brief\n- `app/__design_lab/` or `pages/__design_lab.tsx` — the comparison route\n\nAll of this is deleted when you finalize or abort. Nothing is left behind.\n\n## What Gets Created (Permanently)\n\nAfter finalizing:\n- `DESIGN_PLAN.md` — implementation plan for your chosen design\n- `DESIGN_MEMORY.md` — captured style decisions (speeds up future sessions)\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n---\n\nMade by [0xdesigner](https://github.com/0xdesign)\n",
