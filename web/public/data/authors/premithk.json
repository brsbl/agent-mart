        "README.md": "# Conductor Plugin for Claude Code\nThis is a direct port of [Original Gemini Extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor)\n\n**Measure twice, code once.**\n\nConductor is a Claude Code plugin that enables **Context-Driven Development**. It turns Claude Code into a proactive project manager that follows a strict protocol to specify, plan, and implement software features and bug fixes.\n\nInstead of just writing code, Conductor ensures a consistent, high-quality lifecycle for every task: **Context -> Spec & Plan -> Implement**.\n\nThe philosophy behind Conductor is simple: control your code. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside your code, you transform your repository into a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction with deep, persistent project awareness.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Plan before you build**: Create specs and plans that guide the agent for new and existing codebases.\n- **Maintain context**: Ensure AI follows style guides, tech stack choices, and product goals.\n- **Iterate safely**: Review plans before code is written, keeping you firmly in the loop.\n- **Work as a team**: Set project-level context for your product, tech stack, and workflow preferences that become a shared foundation for your team.\n- **Build on existing projects**: Intelligent initialization for both new (Greenfield) and existing (Brownfield) projects.\n- **Smart revert**: A git-aware revert command that understands logical units of work (tracks, phases, tasks) rather than just commit hashes.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Claude Code CLI** installed (latest version recommended)\n- **Git** (optional, but recommended for revert feature)\n- Internet connection (for GitHub installation)\n\n## Marketplace Setup\n\nThis plugin can be distributed via the Claude Code Plugin Marketplace system. The marketplace configuration is defined in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.\n\n### For Users: Installing from a Marketplace\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add premithk/claude-conductor\nclaude plugin install conductor --scope user\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, verify the plugin is working:\n\n```bash\n# Check if commands are available\nclaude --help | grep conductor\n\n# You should see:\n# /conductor:setup\n# /conductor:newTrack\n# /conductor:implement\n# /conductor:status\n# /conductor:revert\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nConductor is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of your development tasks.\n\n**Note on Token Consumption:** Conductor's context-driven approach involves reading and analyzing your project's context, specifications, and plans. This can lead to increased token consumption, especially in larger projects or during extensive planning and implementation phases.\n\n### 1. Set Up the Project (Run Once)\n\nWhen you run `/conductor:setup`, Conductor helps you define the core components of your project context. This context is then used for building new components or features by you or anyone on your team.\n\n- **Product**: Define project context (e.g. users, product goals, high-level features).\n- **Product guidelines**: Define standards (e.g. prose style, brand messaging, visual identity).\n- **Tech stack**: Configure technical preferences (e.g. language, database, frameworks).\n- **Workflow**: Set team preferences (e.g. TDD, commit strategy). Uses [workflow.md](templates/workflow.md) as a customizable template.\n\n**Generated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/product.md`\n- `conductor/product-guidelines.md`\n- `conductor/tech-stack.md`\n- `conductor/workflow.md`\n- `conductor/code_styleguides/`\n- `conductor/tracks.md`\n\n```bash\n/conductor:setup\n```\n\n### 2. Start a New Track (Feature or Bug)\n\nWhen you're ready to take on a new feature or bug fix, run `/conductor:newTrack`. This initializes a **track** — a high-level unit of work. Conductor helps you generate two critical artifacts:\n\n- **Specs**: The detailed requirements for the specific job. What are we building and why?\n- **Plan**: An actionable to-do list containing phases, tasks, and sub-tasks.\n\n**Generated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md`\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json`\n\n```bash\n/conductor:newTrack\n# OR with a description\n/conductor:newTrack Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page\n```\n\n### 3. Implement the Track\n\nOnce you approve the plan, run `/conductor:implement`. Your coding agent then works through the `plan.md` file, checking off tasks as it completes them.\n\n**Updated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/tracks.md` (Status updates)\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md` (Status updates)\n- Project context files (Synchronized on completion)\n\n```bash\n/conductor:implement\n```\n\nConductor will:\n1.  Select the next pending task.\n2.  Follow the defined workflow (e.g., TDD: Write Test -> Fail -> Implement -> Pass).\n3.  Update the status in the plan as it progresses.\n4.  **Verify Progress**: Guide you through a manual verification step at the end of each phase to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nDuring implementation, you can also:\n\n- **Check status**: Get a high-level overview of your project's progress.\n  ```bash\n  /conductor:status\n  ```\n- **Revert work**: Undo a feature or a specific task if needed.\n  ```bash\n  /conductor:revert\n  ```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n| Command | Description | Artifacts |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `/conductor:setup` | Scaffolds the project and sets up the Conductor environment. Run this once per project. | `conductor/product.md`<br>`conductor/product-guidelines.md`<br>`conductor/tech-stack.md`<br>`conductor/workflow.md`<br>`conductor/tracks.md` |\n| `/conductor:newTrack` | Starts a new feature or bug track. Generates `spec.md` and `plan.md`. | `conductor/tracks/<id>/spec.md`<br>`conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md`<br>`conductor/tracks.md` |\n| `/conductor:implement` | Executes the tasks defined in the current track's plan. | `conductor/tracks.md`<br>`conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md` |\n| `/conductor:status` | Displays the current progress of the tracks file and active tracks. | Reads `conductor/tracks.md` |\n| `/conductor:revert` | Reverts a track, phase, or task by analyzing git history. | Reverts git history |\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Plugin not found after installation\n\n**Problem:** Commands don't appear in `--help`\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check plugin installation:\n   ```bash\n   ls -la ~/.claude/plugins/ | grep conductor\n   ```\n\n2. Verify plugin.json exists:\n   ```bash\n   cat ~/.claude/plugins/claude-conductor/.claude-plugin/plugin.json\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Claude Code or your terminal\n\n## Development\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Claude Code Plugins Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md): Documentation about using plugins in Claude Code\n- [Original Gemini Extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor): The original Conductor extension for Gemini CLI\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 0.1.0 (Current)\n- Updated to use correct tool names (AskUserQuestion)\n- Added .gitignore for cleaner repositories\n- Reorganized utility scripts\n- Enhanced plugin manifest with contributes section\n- Added CONTRIBUTING.md for developers\n\n### 0.0.1\n- Initial port from Gemini CLI extension\n- Core commands: setup, newTrack, implement, status, revert\n- Template system for workflows and style guides\n\n## Legal\n\n- License: [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE)\n"
