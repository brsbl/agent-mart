        "README.md": "# alignment-hive\n\nShared infrastructure for alignment researchers. [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) fellows are the first intended users, but this is built for the broader AI safety community.\n\nLarge orgs benefit from shared tooling and accumulated knowledge across their agents. This project aims to bring some of those advantages to independent researchers:\n\n- **Plugin marketplace** - Curated Claude Code plugins with skills for common research workflows\n- **hive-mind** - A system for sharing session learnings across the community (in development)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nInstall [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) if you haven't already:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Add the marketplace\n\nRun the following commands from within Claude Code (the `/` prefix indicates a Claude Code command):\n```\n/plugin marketplace add Crazytieguy/alignment-hive\n```\n\nEnable auto-update to get new plugins and updates automatically:\n1. Run `/plugin`\n2. Go to the **Marketplaces** tab\n3. Select **alignment-hive**\n4. Select **Enable auto-update**\n5. Press **Esc** twice to exit the menu\n\nInstall the mats plugin (recommended for MATS fellows):\n```\n/plugin install mats@alignment-hive\n```\n\nThe mats plugin includes:\n- **best-practices** - Guided setup for documentation, plugins, tooling, and permissions\n- **fellow-handbook** - Quick lookup of MATS policies, compute access, housing, and program logistics\n- **permissions** - Configure Claude Code permissions to reduce permission prompts\n- **lit-review** - Automated literature review with paper search and summarization\n\nAlso available:\n```\n/plugin install llms-fetch-mcp@alignment-hive\n```\n\nAdds an MCP server for fetching documentation with [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) support.\n\n### Start your project\n\nExit Claude Code and navigate to your project directory:\n```\n/exit\n```\n```bash\ncd ~/my-project && claude\n```\n\nWorks for both new and existing projects. Ask Claude to help you set it up!\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe [plugin-dev](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) plugin auto-installs when you clone this repo, so Claude can help with plugin development.\n\nFeedback and suggestions welcome—open an issue, send a Slack DM, or reach out however works for you. All changes go through PR review.\n\n## Web App\n\nA web interface for hive-mind is in development at [alignment-hive.com](https://alignment-hive.com).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nSee [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for what's planned.\n"
