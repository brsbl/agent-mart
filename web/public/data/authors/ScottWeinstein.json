When a release is created, both the root `package.json` and `plugins/wt-dev/package.json` are updated to the same version.\n\nThis approach:\n\n- Simplifies the release process\n- Ensures compatibility between packages\n- Makes it easy to track which versions were released together\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Adding a New Plugin\n\n1. Create directory: `plugins/<plugin-name>/`\n2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with metadata\n3. Create `README.md` with documentation\n4. Add commands in `commands/*.md` with YAML frontmatter\n5. Add agents in `agents/*.md` with YAML frontmatter\n6. Register in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n\nFor TypeScript plugins:\n\n- Add `package.json` with build scripts\n- Add `tsconfig.json` extending root config\n- Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to include the package\n\n### Making a Release\n\nReleases are done via GitHub Actions to avoid direct commits to `main`.\n\n```bash\npnpm release          # Bump patch: 0.1.1 → 0.1.2\npnpm release --minor  # Bump minor: 0.1.1 → 0.2.0\npnpm release --major  # Bump major: 0.1.1 → 1.0.0\npnpm release --dry-run  # Preview without triggering\n```\n\nThe release workflow will:\n\n- Run all checks and tests\n- Update version in all `package.json` files\n- Commit and tag the release\n- Push to `main`\n- Create a GitHub release with artifacts\n\nRequires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/sw-feature-dev/README.md": "# Feature Development Plugin\n\nA comprehensive, structured workflow for feature development with specialized agents for codebase exploration, architecture design, and quality review.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Feature Development Plugin provides a systematic 7-phase approach to building new features. Instead of jumping straight into code, it guides you through understanding the codebase, asking clarifying questions, designing architecture, and ensuring quality—resulting in better-designed features that integrate seamlessly with your existing code.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nBuilding features requires more than just writing code. You need to:\n\n- **Understand the codebase** before making changes\n- **Ask questions** to clarify ambiguous requirements\n- **Design thoughtfully** before implementing\n- **Review for quality** after building\n\nThis plugin embeds these practices into a structured workflow that runs automatically when you use the `/feature-dev` command.\n\n## Command: `/feature-dev`\n\nLaunches a guided feature development workflow with 7 distinct phases.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n/feature-dev Add user authentication with OAuth\n```\n\nOr simply:\n\n```bash\n/feature-dev\n```\n\nThe command will guide you through the entire process interactively.\n\n## The 7-Phase Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Discovery\n\n**Goal**: Understand what needs to be built\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Clarifies the feature request if it's unclear\n- Asks what problem you're solving\n- Identifies constraints and requirements\n- Summarizes understanding and confirms with you\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nYou: /feature-dev Add caching\nClaude: Let me understand what you need...\n        - What should be cached? (API responses, computed values, etc.)\n        - What are your performance requirements?\n        - Do you have a preferred caching solution?\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Codebase Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Launches 2-3 `code-explorer` agents in parallel\n- Each agent explores different aspects (similar features, architecture, UI patterns)\n- Agents return comprehensive analyses with key files to read\n- Claude reads all identified files to build deep understanding\n- Presents comprehensive summary of findings\n\n**Agents launched:**\n\n- \"Find features similar to [feature] and trace implementation\"\n- \"Map the architecture and abstractions for [area]\"\n- \"Analyze current implementation of [related feature]\"\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nFound similar features:\n- User authentication (src/auth/): Uses JWT tokens, middleware pattern\n- Session management (src/session/): Redis-backed, 24hr expiry\n- API security (src/api/middleware/): Rate limiting, CORS\n\nKey files to understand:\n- src/auth/AuthService.ts:45 - Core authentication logic\n- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts:12 - Request authentication\n- src/config/security.ts:8 - Security configuration\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions\n\n**Goal**: Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Reviews codebase findings and feature request\n- Identifies underspecified aspects:\n  - Edge cases\n  - Error handling\n  - Integration points\n  - Backward compatibility\n  - Performance needs\n- Presents all questions in an organized list\n- **Waits for your answers before proceeding**\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nBefore designing the architecture, I need to clarify:\n\n1. OAuth provider: Which OAuth providers? (Google, GitHub, custom?)\n2. User data: Store OAuth tokens or just user profile?\n3. Existing auth: Replace current auth or add alongside?\n4. Sessions: Integrate with existing session management?\n5. Error handling: How to handle OAuth failures?\n```\n\n**Critical**: This phase ensures nothing is ambiguous before design begins.\n\n### Phase 4: Architecture Design\n\n**Goal**: Design multiple implementation approaches\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Launches 2-3 `code-architect` agents with different focuses:\n  - **Minimal changes**: Smallest change, maximum reuse\n  - **Clean architecture**: Maintainability, elegant abstractions\n  - **Pragmatic balance**: Speed + quality\n- Reviews all approaches\n- Forms opinion on which fits best for this task\n- Presents comparison with trade-offs and recommendation\n- **Asks which approach you prefer**\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nI've designed 3 approaches:\n\nApproach 1: Minimal Changes\n- Extend existing AuthService with OAuth methods\n- Add new OAuth routes to existing auth router\n- Minimal refactoring required\nPros: Fast, low risk\nCons: Couples OAuth to existing auth, harder to test\n\nApproach 2: Clean Architecture\n- New OAuthService with dedicated interface\n- Separate OAuth router and middleware\n- Refactor AuthService to use common interface\nPros: Clean separation, testable, maintainable\nCons: More files, more refactoring\n\nApproach 3: Pragmatic Balance\n- New OAuthProvider abstraction\n- Integrate into existing AuthService\n- Minimal refactoring, good boundaries\nPros: Balanced complexity and cleanliness\nCons: Some coupling remains\n\nRecommendation: Approach 3 - gives you clean boundaries without\nexcessive refactoring, and fits your existing architecture well.\n\nWhich approach would you like to use?\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Implementation\n\n**Goal**: Build the feature\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- **Waits for explicit approval** before starting\n- Reads all relevant files identified in previous phases\n- Implements following chosen architecture\n- Follows codebase conventions strictly\n- Writes clean, well-documented code\n- Updates todos as progress is made\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Implementation only starts after you approve\n- Follows patterns discovered in Phase 2\n- Uses architecture designed in Phase 4\n- Continuously tracks progress\n\n### Phase 6: Quality Review\n\n**Goal**: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, and functionally correct\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Launches 3 `code-reviewer` agents in parallel with different focuses:\n  - **Simplicity/DRY/Elegance**: Code quality and maintainability\n  - **Bugs/Correctness**: Functional correctness and logic errors\n  - **Conventions/Abstractions**: Project standards and patterns\n- Consolidates findings\n- Identifies highest severity issues\n- **Presents findings and asks what you want to do**:\n  - Fix now\n  - Fix later\n  - Proceed as-is\n- Addresses issues based on your decision\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nCode Review Results:\n\nHigh Priority Issues:\n1. Missing error handling in OAuth callback (src/auth/oauth.ts:67)\n2. Memory leak: OAuth state not cleaned up (src/auth/oauth.ts:89)\n\nMedium Priority:\n1. Could simplify token refresh logic (src/auth/oauth.ts:120)\n2. Consider extracting OAuth config validation\n\nAll tests pass. Code follows project conventions.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n```\n\n### Phase 7: Summary\n\n**Goal**: Document what was accomplished\n\n**What happens:**\n\n- Marks all todos complete\n- Summarizes:\n  - What was built\n  - Key decisions made\n  - Files modified\n  - Suggested next steps\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nFeature Complete: OAuth Authentication\n\nWhat was built:\n- OAuth provider abstraction supporting Google and GitHub\n- OAuth routes and middleware integrated with existing auth\n- Token refresh and session integration\n- Error handling for all OAuth flows\n\nKey decisions:\n- Used pragmatic approach with OAuthProvider abstraction\n- Integrated with existing session management\n- Added OAuth state to prevent CSRF\n\nFiles modified:\n- src/auth/OAuthProvider.ts (new)\n- src/auth/AuthService.ts\n- src/routes/auth.ts\n- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts\n\nSuggested next steps:\n- Add tests for OAuth flows\n- Add more OAuth providers (Microsoft, Apple)\n- Update documentation\n```\n\n## Agents\n\n### `code-explorer`\n\n**Purpose**: Deeply analyzes existing codebase features by tracing execution paths\n\n**Focus areas:**\n\n- Entry points and call chains\n- Data flow and transformations\n- Architecture layers and patterns\n- Dependencies and integrations\n- Implementation details\n\n**When triggered:**\n\n- Automatically in Phase 2\n- Can be invoked manually when exploring code\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Entry points with file:line references\n- Step-by-step execution flow\n- Key components and responsibilities\n- Architecture insights\n- List of essential files to read\n\n### `code-architect`\n\n**Purpose**: Designs feature architectures and implementation blueprints\n\n**Focus areas:**\n\n- Codebase pattern analysis\n- Architecture decisions\n- Component design\n- Implementation roadmap\n- Data flow and build sequence\n\n**When triggered:**\n\n- Automatically in Phase 4\n- Can be invoked manually for architecture design\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Patterns and conventions found\n- Architecture decision with rationale\n- Complete component design\n- Implementation map with specific files\n- Build sequence with phases\n\n### `code-reviewer`\n\n**Purpose**: Reviews code for bugs, quality issues, and project conventions\n\n**Focus areas:**\n\n- Project guideline compliance (CLAUDE.md)\n- Bug detection\n- Code quality issues\n- Confidence-based filtering (only reports high-confidence issues ≥80)\n\n**When triggered:**\n\n- Automatically in Phase 6\n- Can be invoked manually after writing code\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Critical issues (confidence 75-100)\n- Important issues (confidence 50-74)\n- Specific fixes with file:line references\n- Project guideline references\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\n### Full workflow (recommended for new features):\n\n```bash\n/feature-dev Add rate limiting to API endpoints\n```\n\nLet the workflow guide you through all 7 phases.\n\n### Manual agent invocation:\n\n**Explore a feature:**\n\n```\n\"Launch code-explorer to trace how authentication works\"\n```\n\n**Design architecture:**\n\n```\n\"Launch code-architect to design the caching layer\"\n```\n\n**Review code:**\n\n```\n\"Launch code-reviewer to check my recent changes\"\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use the full workflow for complex features**: The 7 phases ensure thorough planning\n2. **Answer clarifying questions thoughtfully**: Phase 3 prevents future confusion\n3. **Choose architecture deliberately**: Phase 4 gives you options for a reason\n4. **Don't skip code review**: Phase 6 catches issues before they reach production\n5. **Read the suggested files**: Phase 2 identifies key files—read them to understand context\n\n## When to Use This Plugin\n\n**Use for:**\n\n- New features that touch multiple files\n- Features requiring architectural decisions\n- Complex integrations with existing code\n- Features where requirements are somewhat unclear\n\n**Don't use for:**\n\n- Single-line bug fixes\n- Trivial changes\n- Well-defined, simple tasks\n- Urgent hotfixes\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code installed\n- Git repository (for code review)\n- Project with existing codebase (workflow assumes existing code to learn from)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Agents take too long\n\n**Issue**: Code exploration or architecture agents are slow\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- This is normal for large codebases\n- Agents run in parallel when possible\n- The thoroughness pays off in better understanding\n\n### Too many clarifying questions\n\n**Issue**: Phase 3 asks too many questions\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- Be more specific in your initial feature request\n- Provide context about constraints upfront\n- Say \"whatever you think is best\" if truly no preference\n\n### Architecture options overwhelming\n\n**Issue**: Too many architecture options in Phase 4\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- Trust the recommendation—it's based on codebase analysis\n- If still unsure, ask for more explanation\n- Pick the pragmatic option when in doubt\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Be specific in your feature request**: More detail = fewer clarifying questions\n- **Trust the process**: Each phase builds on the previous one\n- **Review agent outputs**: Agents provide valuable insights about your codebase\n- **Don't skip phases**: Each phase serves a purpose\n- **Use for learning**: The exploration phase teaches you about your own codebase\n\n## Author\n\nSid Bidasaria (sbidasaria@anthropic.com)\n\n## Version\n\n1.0.0\n",
        "plugins/wt-dev/README.md": "# wt-dev\n\nUnified worktree and Inngest dev server management for multi-worktree Next.js projects.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install from GitHub\npnpm add -D \"github:ScottWeinstein/cc-plugins#main&path:plugins/wt-dev\"\n```\n\nThe postinstall script will automatically register the Claude Code plugin.\n\n### Verify Installation\n\n```bash\n# Check CLI is working\nnpx wt-dev --help\n\n# Check Claude Code plugin is registered\nnpx wt-dev register --status\n```\n\nfinally, add `.claude/plugins/wt-dev` to `.gitignore`\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd to your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"wt-dev dev\",\n    \"inngest\": \"wt-dev inngest\"\n  },\n  \"devServer\": {\n    \"basePort\": 3000,\n    \"maxPorts\": 10,\n    \"inngestPort\": 8288\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `basePort`: Starting port for the pool (default: 5001)\n- `maxPorts`: Number of ports in the pool (default: 128, valid range: 1-128, values outside range are clamped with a warning). Keep this small if you need to register OAuth callback URLs for each port.\n- `inngestPort`: Port for the shared Inngest server (default: 8288)\n\nEach worktree gets a deterministic port based on its path hash.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Dev Server\n\n```bash\npnpm dev              # Start dev server\npnpm dev --force      # Kill existing and restart\npnpm dev --status     # Show status and URL\npnpm dev --stop       # Stop server\npnpm dev --logs       # Tail logs\n```\n\nOverride port: `PORT=3000 pnpm dev`\n\n### Inngest Server\n\n```bash\npnpm inngest          # Start/ensure Inngest running\npnpm inngest --status # Show status\npnpm inngest --stop   # Stop (affects all worktrees!)\npnpm inngest --restart\npnpm inngest --logs\n```\n\n### Plugin Management\n\n```bash\nnpx wt-dev register           # Register Claude Code plugin\nnpx wt-dev register --status  # Check registration status\nnpx wt-dev register --force   # Force re-register\nnpx wt-dev unregister         # Remove registration\n```\n\n## Claude Code Skills\n\nAfter installation, Claude Code gains two skills:\n\n- **dev-server**: Manages per-worktree Next.js dev servers\n- **inngest**: Manages the shared Inngest dev server\n\nThese skills teach Claude how to use wt-dev commands and handle common scenarios like port conflicts.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│ Worktree A      │     │ Worktree B      │     │ Worktree C      │\n│ Port 5001       │     │ Port 5002       │     │ Port 5003       │\n│ Next.js dev     │     │ Next.js dev     │     │ Next.js dev     │\n└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘\n         │                       │                       │\n         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘\n                                 │\n                          ┌──────▼──────┐\n                          │   Inngest   │\n                          │  Port 8288  │\n                          │  (shared)   │\n                          └─────────────┘\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Port assignment**: Hash-based with collision detection. Each worktree gets a deterministic port based on MD5(worktreePath). Collision resolution uses secondary hashes. Creation order priority ensures ports never change when worktrees are added/removed.\n- **Process management**: SIGKILL only (Next.js ignores SIGTERM), race condition detection\n- **Port detection**: ss → lsof → netstat → Node.js (multi-method fallback)\n- **Inngest coordination**: Lock-based startup, PID tracking, health checks\n\n## Programmatic API\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n  loadConfig,\n  getWorktreeConfig,\n  startDevServer,\n  stopDevServer,\n  ensureInngestServer,\n  getInngestStatus,\n  isPortInUse,\n  registerPlugin,\n  checkRegistration,\n} from 'wt-dev';\n\n// Get worktree port and URL\nconst wtConfig = getWorktreeConfig();\nconsole.log(wtConfig.port); // 5001\nconsole.log(wtConfig.baseUrl); // http://localhost:5001\n\n// Manage dev server\nconst config = loadConfig();\nawait startDevServer(config);\nawait startDevServer(config, { force: true }); // force restart\nawait stopDevServer(config);\n\n// Manage Inngest (shared across worktrees)\nawait ensureInngestServer(config); // idempotent\nconst status = getInngestStatus(config);\nif (status.running) console.log(`PID: ${status.pid}`);\n\n// Port utilities\nif (await isPortInUse(5001)) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n// Plugin registration\nconst result = registerPlugin({ force: true });\nconst regStatus = checkRegistration();\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js >= 24.11.0\n- pnpm\n- Next.js with turbopack (for dev server)\n- Claude Code (for skills)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
