        "README.md": "# Ralph Wiggum Loop\n\n> \"I'm helping!\" - Ralph Wiggum\n\nAn automated task implementation system that uses Claude Code CLI to work through a project todo list, one task at a time.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe Ralph Wiggum Loop reads tasks from a JSON todo list and iteratively runs Claude Code to implement each one. For each task, it:\n\n1. Selects the highest-priority pending task (respecting dependencies)\n2. Generates a detailed prompt with task requirements\n3. Runs Claude Code to implement the task\n4. Tracks progress and learns from failures\n5. Retries failed tasks (up to 5 times) before moving on\n\n---\n\n## Why Use Ralph Loop?\n\n### The Problem with One Giant Session\n\nWhen you ask Claude to complete a large project in a single session, you run into problems:\n\n- **Context window fills up**: As the conversation grows, Claude's context window gets cluttered with old messages, failed attempts, and irrelevant information\n- **Degraded performance**: Claude becomes less focused and effective as context bloats\n- **No recovery from failures**: If Claude gets stuck or makes mistakes, the entire session is compromised\n- **Lost progress on crashes**: If the session crashes, you lose everything\n\n### The Solution: Fresh Context + External Memory\n\nRalph Loop solves this by running **each task in a fresh Claude Code session**:\n\n**Fresh Context Window**: Each task gets a brand new Claude instance with a clean context. Claude starts fresh, focused only on the current task with clear instructions. No accumulated confusion from previous work.\n\n**External Memory System**: Two files persist information between sessions:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `todolist.json` | **Task State Memory** - Tracks which tasks are pending, passed, or failed. Stores dependencies, priorities, and notes. Claude updates this after each task. |\n| `progress.txt` | **Learning Memory** - Logs what happened in each session: what worked, what failed, and lessons learned. Future sessions can learn from past mistakes. |\n\n**Orchestration Script**: `ralph_wiggum_loop.sh` ties it together - it reads the external memory, launches focused Claude sessions, and ensures continuity across the entire project.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Consistent quality**: Each task gets Claude's full attention with clean context\n- **Automatic recovery**: Failed tasks are retried with lessons from previous attempts\n- **Progress persistence**: Work is saved after each task, not lost on crashes\n- **Scalable**: Can handle projects with dozens or hundreds of tasks\n- **Hands-off**: Run overnight and wake up to a completed project\n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Better For Your Brain\n\nMost discussions focus on why Ralph Loop improves *AI's* efficiency. But here's what almost nobody talks about: **it also improves *your* efficiency as a human.**\n\n### The Hidden Trap of Synchronous AI Collaboration\n\nWhen you work with AI in real-time, here's what actually happens:\n\nYou ask AI to refactor a module. It starts running. You wait. Five minutes pass. You think \"might as well do something useful,\" so you jump to another project. Two minutes later, the first AI throws an error—needs your intervention. You switch back, spend time rebuilding mental context, make a decision. AI starts running again. You wait. You switch to a third project...\n\nBy the end of the day, you feel like you've been \"working\" nonstop—but you never actually thought deeply about anything. Your brain spent the whole day oscillating between \"about to enter deep thought\" and \"interrupted.\"\n\n**This isn't AI's fault. It isn't your fault either. It's a structural flaw in synchronous collaboration:** human cognitive rhythms and AI execution rhythms are fundamentally mismatched.\n\n### The Cognitive Science\n\nThe research data on this kind of task-bouncing is brutal:\n\n| Finding | Impact |\n|---------|--------|\n| Each task switch costs **20% of cognitive capacity** | Your thinking power drains with every interruption |\n| It takes **23 minutes** to regain focus after interruption | Most AI tasks complete faster than your recovery time |\n| Multitasking consumes **40% of work hours** | Nearly half your day lost to switching overhead |\n| Multitaskers make **50% more errors** | Quality suffers alongside productivity |\n| A mere **5-second interruption** triples error rate | Even brief AI check-ins are costly |\n| Knowledge workers switch apps **1,200+ times/day** | ~4 hours/week wasted on switching alone |\n\n**Working memory is limited to 3–4 items**—not the \"magical seven\" we once believed. Traditional AI collaboration forces you to simultaneously track: Project A is on step 5, Project B just threw an error, Project C needs a decision... Your working memory fills up fast.\n\n**Only 22% of knowledge workers** manage more than 2 hours of deep work per day. Yet deep workers earn **17% more** on average and report lower stress and higher fulfillment. Deep work has a counterintuitive property: doing harder, deeper work actually feels *easier*—because it puts you in flow state instead of perpetual fragmentation.\n\n### How Ralph Loop Breaks the Trap\n\nThe design philosophy is simple: **separate planning from execution. Let humans and AI each work at their own pace.**\n\n- AI gets stuck? It clears its own context and retries\n- Task fails multiple times? AI logs possible reasons and moves on, leaving notes for your review\n- AI doesn't stop to wait for you. You don't need to stop to wait for AI\n\n**What this means in practice:**\n\nDuring planning, you can think holistically about the entire project—steps, dependencies, alternative approaches. You can give each step multiple options for AI to try overnight. You won't be interrupted mid-thought by \"AI is executing step 3, I need to wait for the result.\"\n\nAnd here's the crucial point: during the planning phase, you can absolutely keep talking to AI. Ask it to refine your task list, think through project structure, catch edge cases. This kind of dialogue is part of deep thinking, not an interruption to it.\n\n**Conversational planning ≠ supervisory execution.** The first helps you think. The second drains your cognition. Ralph Loop lets you keep the first and ditch the second.\n\n### Play to Your Strengths\n\n| Human Brains Excel At | AI Excels At |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Deep thinking | Sustained execution |\n| Strategic planning | Tireless repetition |\n| Creative problem-solving | Mechanical task processing |\n\nWhy force the human brain to do \"supervise AI execution\"—something it's terrible at? That's wasting your most precious cognitive resource.\n\n**Focus isn't a limitation. It's liberation.**\n\n### The Recommended Workflow\n\n1. **Morning**: 2–4 hours of focused task planning. Natural language. No execution. Talk to AI constantly—refining task lists, catching edge cases, mapping the project structure.\n2. **Before bed**: Start the loop with `./ralph_wiggum_loop.sh`\n3. **Next morning**: Review AI's logs and summary. Enter flow again—planning the next iteration.\n\n**Every additional day in traditional AI collaboration mode, you're potentially wasting:**\n- 20% of your cognitive capacity\n- 40% of your working hours\n- Countless opportunities for deep, fulfilling work\n\nLet cognitive science work for you, not against you.\n\n*Good night. Sleep well. Let the AI have the nightmares.*\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Quick Install (Download Skill File)\n\nThe simplest way to use Ralph Loop is to download the self-contained `.skill` file to your project:\n\n```bash\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kangning-huang/ralph-loop-setup/main/ralph-loop-setup.skill\n```\n\nThen in Claude Code, invoke it using the `@` syntax:\n\n```\n@ralph-loop-setup.skill set up Ralph Loop for my project\n```\n\nClaude will read the skill instructions and guide you through creating all three required files interactively.\n\n### Option 2: Plugin Marketplace (Claude Code)\n\nInstall through Claude Code in two steps:\n\n**Step 1: Add the marketplace**\n```\n/plugin marketplace add kangning-huang/ralph-loop-setup\n```\n\n**Step 2: Install the plugin**\n```\n/plugin install ralph-loop-setup@ralph-loop-setup\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Claude Code CLI** from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)\n- **jq** - JSON processor (`brew install jq` on macOS)\n\n---\n\n## Installation on Other Platforms\n\n### OpenAI Codex CLI\n\n**Option 1: Using skill-installer (Recommended)**\n\nIn Codex CLI, ask it to install from this GitHub repo:\n```\nInstall the ralph-loop-setup skill from kangning-huang/ralph_wiggum_loop\n```\n\n**Option 2: Manual Installation**\n\n1.
