Instead of a single AI assistant, you get:\n\n- **29 Agents** including specialists, planners, reviewers, and an orchestrator\n- **9 Grumpy Reviewers** who find flaws others miss\n- **12 Slash Commands** for project planning, scoping, implementation, and code review\n\nThe result: thoroughly planned projects, battle-tested code, and solutions that have survived scrutiny from multiple perspectives.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Install the Plugin\n\n```\n/install-github-plugin JackScammell/Parliament-Of-Chaos\n```\n\n### Your First Command\n\n**For code review and development tasks:**\n\n```\n/summon-council Design an authentication system with JWT and RBAC\n```\n\n**For planning a new project:**\n\n```\n/plan-project A CLI tool for managing Docker containers\n```\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n### Council Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/summon-council [task]` | Orchestrate specialists + grumpy review cycle for complex tasks |\n| `/summon-grumpy-reviewer` | Quick, ruthless code review from a senior developer perspective |\n| `/parliament-review` | Full review using all 9 grumpy reviewers for maximum scrutiny |\n| `/summon-specialist <agent>` | Directly invoke a specialist agent on your current task |\n\n### Discovery Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/list-agents` | Display all agents grouped by category |\n| `/list-commands` | Display all commands grouped by category |\n| `/explain-agent <agent>` | Detailed explanation of what an agent does and when to use it |\n\n### Project Planning Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/plan-project [description]` | Interactive Q&A to create project-outline.md, feature-implementation.md, and Roadmap.md |\n| `/project-status` | Dashboard showing roadmap progress across all phases |\n| `/roadmap-add-item <name> --phase <n>` | Add a new item to an existing roadmap |\n| `/roadmap-item-scope <item>` | Create detailed Spec.md and tasks.md for a roadmap item |\n| `/implement-task-list [item]` | Execute tasks with full council review (specialists + grumpy approval) |\n\n---\n\n## Agents\n\n### Planning Agents (3)\n\n| Agent | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| project-oracle | Conducts project scoping via Q&A, creates project outline and roadmap |\n| scope-weaver | Breaks roadmap items into detailed specs and actionable tasks |\n| task-executor | Handles task tracking, safety checks, and documentation (utility for senior-council) |\n\n### Specialist Agents (16)\n\n| Agent | Domain |\n|-------|--------|\n| system-architect | High-level design, patterns, trade-offs |\n| backend-goblin | Backend performance, caching, async patterns |\n| security-knight | Authentication, vulnerabilities, hardening |\n| data-warlock | Database design, queries, migrations |\n| api-keeper | API design, versioning, contracts |\n| test-prophet | Testing strategy, coverage, TDD |\n| ui-ux-guru | Accessibility, UX patterns, frontend |\n| pipeline-engineer | CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure |\n| doc-bard | Documentation, comments, READMEs |\n| package-wizard | Dependencies, versions, compatibility |\n| resilience-tamer | Error handling, retries, failure modes |\n| migration-monk | Schema migrations, rollback strategies |\n| dependency-detective | Vulnerability chains, license compliance |\n| refactor-ranger | Code smells, refactoring patterns |\n| config-curator | Environment config, secrets, feature flags |\n| observability-oracle | Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting |\n\n### Grumpy Reviewers (9)\n\n| Agent | Focus |\n|-------|-------|\n| grumpy-code-reviewer | Overall code quality |\n| grumpy-standards-enforcer | Coding standards compliance |\n| grumpy-architecture-skeptic | Architectural decisions |\n| grumpy-maintainability-curmudgeon | Long-term maintenance burden |\n| grumpy-security-nag | Security oversights |\n| grumpy-performance-troll | Performance issues |\n| grumpy-accessibility-auditor | WCAG compliance, inclusive design |\n| grumpy-documentation-pedant | Documentation completeness |\n| grumpy-testing-tyrant | Test coverage and quality |\n\n### Orchestrator (1)\n\n| Agent | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| senior-council | Coordinates all agents, runs iterative review cycles until approval |\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### The Council Workflow\n\nWhen you invoke `/summon-council`:\n\n1. **Analyse** - The Senior Council identifies which domains your task requires\n2. **Dispatch** - Appropriate specialists are selected and consulted\n3. **Review** - All outputs pass through the grumpy reviewer panel\n4. **Iterate** - Feedback routes back to specialists until all reviewers approve. Conflicts resolved via priority (security > correctness > maintainability > performance)\n5. **Synthesise** - Final solution is delivered with documented trade-offs\n\n### The Planning Workflow\n\nWhen you invoke `/plan-project`:\n\n1. **Discovery** - The Project Oracle asks clarifying questions about your project\n2. **Outline** - Creates `project-outline.md` with goals, constraints, and scope\n3. **Features** - Generates `feature-implementation.md` breaking down capabilities\n4. **Roadmap** - Produces `Roadmap.md` with phased implementation plan\n\nThen use `/roadmap-item-scope` to expand items into specs and tasks, and `/implement-task-list` to execute them with full council oversight (specialists implement, grumpy reviewers approve).\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Document | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) | Detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting |\n| [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) | In-depth command usage with examples |\n| [Hooks Configuration](docs/hooks.md) | Set up notifications and automated actions |\n| [Safe Progress Assurance](docs/safe-progress-assurance.md) | How the system ensures reliable task completion |\n| [Example Project Files](docs/example-project-files/) | Sample outputs from the planning workflow |\n\n---\n\n## Project Files\n\nParliament of Chaos creates and manages files in `.project-files/`:\n\n```\n.project-files/\n  project-outline.md      # Project goals, constraints, scope\n  feature-implementation.md   # Feature breakdown\n  Roadmap.md              # Phased implementation plan\n  roadmap/\n    <item-name>/\n      Spec.md             # Detailed specification\n      tasks.md            # Actionable task list\n      work_complete.md    # Completion record\n```\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/install-github-plugin JackScammell/Parliament-Of-Chaos\n```\n\nFor detailed installation steps, verification, and troubleshooting, see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
