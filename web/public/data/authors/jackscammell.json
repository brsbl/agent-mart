Instead of a single AI assistant, you get:\n\n- **30 Agents** including specialists, planners, reviewers, and orchestrators\n- **9 Grumpy Reviewers** who find flaws others miss\n- **13 Slash Commands** for project planning, scoping, implementation, code review, and structured deliberation\n\nThe result: thoroughly planned projects, battle-tested code, and solutions that have survived scrutiny from multiple perspectives.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Install the Plugin\n\n```\n/install-github-plugin JackScammell/Parliament-Of-Chaos\n```\n\n### Your First Command\n\n**For code review and development tasks:**\n\n```\n/summon-council Design an authentication system with JWT and RBAC\n```\n\n**For planning a new project:**\n\n```\n/plan-project A CLI tool for managing Docker

approval |\n| deliberation-conductor | Orchestrates structured debates with parallel execution and convergence detection |\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### The Council Workflow\n\nWhen you invoke `/summon-council`:\n\n1. **Analyse** - The Senior Council identifies which domains your task requires\n2. **Dispatch** - Appropriate specialists are selected and consulted\n3. **Review** - All outputs pass through the grumpy reviewer panel\n4. **Iterate** - Feedback routes back to specialists until all reviewers approve. Conflicts resolved via priority (security > correctness > maintainability > performance)\n5. **Synthesise** - Final solution is delivered with documented trade-offs\n\n### The Planning Workflow\n\nWhen you invoke `/plan-project`:\n\n1. **Discovery** - The Project Oracle asks clarifying questions about your project\n2. **Outline** - Creates `project-outline.md` with goals, constraints, and scope\n3. **Features** - Generates `feature-implementation.md` breaking down capabilities\n4. **Roadmap** - Produces `Roadmap.md` with phased implementation plan\n\nThen use `/roadmap-item-scope` to expand items into specs and tasks, and `/implement-task-list` to execute them with full council oversight (specialists implement, grumpy reviewers approve).\n\n---\n\n## Enhanced Features\n\nParliament of Chaos now includes advanced features leveraging Claude Code's latest capabilities:\n\n### 🎯 Context Optimization and Management **ENHANCED**\n- **70% Token Reduction**: Accurate token counting with tiktoken, dynamic pruning, and deduplication\n- **Session Token Monitor**: Real-time tracking with automatic compression triggers\n- **Token Budget Enforcer**: Per-agent budget limits with automatic context compression\n- **Statement Deduplication**: Jaccard similarity detection to prevent redundant arguments\n- **Context Pruning**: Remove low-confidence statements while preserving high-influence agents\n- **Bounded Memory**: Token usage independent of debate length\n- **Multi-Session Support**: Persist and restore context across sessions\n- **Semantic Retrieval**: Optional vector memory integration for relevant arguments\n- **Token Tracking**: Real-time metrics and optimization statistics\n- **Backward Compatible**: Opt-in system maintaining legacy support\n\n### 🤝 Native Agent Teams Integration\n- **Structured Debate Teams**: Advocate, Opponent, Moderator, and Synthesis roles\n- **Parallel Execution**: Teams work simultaneously for faster deliberation\n- **Real-time Coordination**: Visual output showing debate activity and progress\n\n### 🧠 Persistent Memory System\n- **Cross-Session Learning**: Remember debates across projects\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Track conceptual evolution and solutions\n- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant past discussions by topic\n\n### 🔌 Plugin Marketplace\n- **Community Agents**: Install specialist agents from the marketplace\n- **Extensible System**: `/plugin-install [name]` to add new capabilities\n- **Skill Trees**: Hierarchical expertise for token-efficient specialization\n\n### 📊 Debate Analytics Dashboard\n- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Consensus scores, agent influence, argument novelty\n- **Visual Reports**: Markdown dashboards with trends and insights\n- **Performance Tracking**: Token usage, latency, time to convergence\n\n### 🎯 Advanced Governance Models\n- **Confidence-Weighted Voting**: Votes weighted by agent confidence\n- **Coalition Formation**: Agents align based on positions and values\n- **Delegated Voting**: High-confidence agents receive more weight\n- **Supermajority & Quadratic**: Multiple voting system options\n\n### ⚙️ User-Driven Constraints\n- **YAML Configuration**: Define debate rules and patterns to avoid\n- **Automatic Validation**: Agents check against constraints\n- **Custom Rules**: Pattern matching and requirement enforcement\n\n### 🔄 Multi-Session Debate Chaining\n- **Stateful Debates**: Carry context across multiple sessions\n- **Conflict Tracking**: Monitor and resolve unresolved issues\n- **Session Summaries**: Compressed history for long-running topics\n\n### 🎓 Self-Improving Agents\n- **Meta-Learning**: Track strategy performance over time\n- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents learn from past debates\n- **Pattern Evolution**: Identify successful and failed approaches\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Document | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) | Detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting |\n| [Update Guide](docs/UPDATE.md) | **How plugin updates work -
