For\nnow, there is only one plugin, called `eng`, and the point of it is to collect\n[skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). A skill is a directory containing a markdown file that tells Claude\nhow to do a task, plus whatever additional scripts and reference documents it might need. Skills are are not loaded into context unless they are needed. The [skill docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) explain when skills are loaded into context.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add oxidecomputer/claude-plugins\n/plugin install eng@oxide\n```\n\nThis will make the skills in the plugin available to Claude. To use a skill, you\ncan say \"use the ... skill to ...\". Claude can also decide on its own when to\nuse a skill based on the skill's name and description.\n\n## Updating\n\nAfter new skills are pushed to this repo, pull updates with:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace update oxide\n```\n\n## Adding a skill\n\nAdd skills that might be useful to others. Add a directory `eng/skills` with a `SKILL.md` in it, like `eng/skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md`. Make sure the skill has a `description` in the YAML frontmatter that will help Claude decide when to use it.\n\nSee the [skills overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) and [skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) from Anthropic.\n"
