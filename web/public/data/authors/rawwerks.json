        "README.md": "# Ralph Eats Beads\n\n![Ralph Eats Beads](ralph-eats-beads.jpg)\n\n\"[Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/)\" autonomous AI coding loop, using [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for task management with parallel tmux subagents.\n\nRalph ships features while you sleep, by eating all of the beads. \n\nFor those in the know, you can think of Ralph Eats Beads as \"Gas Town Lite\". I find it much more powerful than a \"vanilla Ralph\" loop, yet much faster to start and easier to wield than [Gas Town](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code (Interactive)\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add rawwerks/ralph-eats-beads\n/plugin install ralph-eats-beads@ralph-eats-beads\n```\n\n### Claude CLI\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add rawwerks/ralph-eats-beads\nclaude plugin install ralph-eats-beads@ralph-eats-beads\n```\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe \"parent\" Ralph/Claude picks issues from `bd ready`, spawns parallel Ralph/Claude subagents in tmux windows to implement them, and closes issues on success. Each iteration:\n\n1. Parent agent checks `bd ready` for available work\n2. Spawns 3-5 subagent tmux windows (one per issue)\n3. Each subagent implements ONE issue, commits, closes it\n4. Watchdog monitors for stuck agents and nudges/kills them\n5. Loop repeats until no work remains or max iterations hit\n\n```\nralph (tmux session)\n├── parent (window 0) - orchestrator\n├── watchdog (window 1) - health monitor  \n├── issue-1 (window 2) - subagent\n├── issue-2 (window 3) - subagent\n└── issue-3 (window 4) - subagent\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **[bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)** - Issue tracker (beads)\n- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer\n- **claude** - Claude CLI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create issues to work on\nbd create --type epic \"Feature: User Auth\"\nbd create \"Add login form\" --parent <epic-id>\nbd create \"Add validation\" --parent <epic-id>\n\n# 2. Start Ralph (default: 10 iterations max)\n./scripts/ralph.sh\n\n# 3. Or specify max iterations\n./scripts/ralph.sh 25\n\n# 4. Watch progress\ntmux attach -t ralph-<project>\n```\n\n## How Iterations Work\n\n- **Max iterations** = how many times the parent can spawn a batch of subagents\n- Each iteration handles multiple issues in parallel (3-5 concurrent)\n- Loop exits early if `bd ready` returns no work\n- Default timeout: 1 hour per iteration\n\n## On Failure\n\n- Subagent adds comment: `bd comments add <id> \"Blocked: <reason>\"`\n- Issue stays open for next iteration or manual fix\n- Watchdog kills stuck windows after 2 nudge attempts\n\n## Planning: Converting Requirements to Issues\n\nIn a typical \"Ralph eats beads\" workflow, you would have already converted your plan into bd epics, issues, dependencies, and notes before running `ralph.sh`. This is the recommended approach: carefully curate the plan, collaborate with Claude/Codex/etc to convert to bd and make sure that the agent does not miss any details. I often find it helpful to ask Claude to spin up an \"auditor\" subagent to check that every aspect of the plan was converted to bd. I also include in my CLAUDE.md: `When exiting Plan Mode, all plans must be fully converted into bd epics, issues, dependencies, and notes`.\n\nHowever, if you haven't done that step yet, you can use the **planner script** to generate bd issues from a requirements file:\n\n```bash\n# From a requirements file\n./scripts/planner.sh requirements.md\n\n# From inline text\n./scripts/planner.sh <<< \"Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub\"\n\n# From a pipe\ncat feature-spec.md | ./scripts/planner.sh\n```\n\nThe planner runs a recursive loop that:\n1. Reads your requirements\n2. Creates an epic and stories in bd\n3. Sets up dependencies between issues\n4. Iterates until the plan fully covers the requirements\n\nOnce planning is complete, run `ralph.sh` to implement.\n\n## Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `scripts/ralph.sh` | Main entry point |\n| `scripts/planner.sh` | Generate issues from requirements |\n| `scripts/watchdog.sh` | Health monitor |\n| `SKILL.md` | Full agent instructions |\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "SKILL.md": "---\nname: ralph-eats-beads\ndescription: Autonomous AI coding loop using bd for task management with parallel tmux subagents. Ships features while you sleep.\nlicense: MIT\n---\n\n# Ralph BD - Parallel Autonomous Coding Loop\n\n**Contract**: `skills-lib-lkv` (Ralph Contract v1)\n\nRalph runs Claude agents in a loop, picking tasks from `bd ready`, implementing them, and closing them on success. This version uses tmux for observability and supports parallel subagents.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nralph (tmux session)\n├── parent (window 0) - orchestrator Claude\n├── watchdog (window 1) - health monitor Claude (optional)\n├── BD-001 (window 2) - subagent\n├── BD-002 (window 3) - subagent\n└── BD-003 (window 4) - subagent\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **bd** initialized with issues/epic\n- **tmux** installed\n- **Claude CLI** (`claude` command available)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Option A: Manual Plan (you create issues)\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create your epic and issues\nbd create --type epic \"Feature: User Authentication\"\nbd create \"Add login form\" --parent BD-001 --priority 1\nbd create \"Add email validation\" --parent BD-001 --priority 2\nbd create \"Add auth server action\" --parent BD-001 --priority 3\n\n# 2. Start Ralph (25 max iterations)\nscripts/ralph.sh 25\n\n# 3. Attach to watch\ntmux attach -t ralph\n```\n\n### Option B: AI-Generated Plan (planner creates issues)\n\n```bash\n# 1. Let Claude create the plan from requirements\nscripts/planner.sh requirements.md\n\n# Or inline:\nscripts/planner.sh <<< \"Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers\"\n\n# Or pipe from anywhere:\ncat feature-spec.md | scripts/planner.sh\n\n# 2. Watch the planner\ntmux attach -t ralph-plan\n\n# 3. Once plan is created, implement it\nscripts/ralph.sh 25\n```\n\n## Planning vs Implementation\n\n| Script | Session | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| `planner.sh` | ralph-plan | **Recursive loop** - creates/refines bd issues until plan is complete |\n| `ralph.sh` | ralph | **Parallel loop** - implements issues from `bd ready` |\n\n**Workflow:**\n```\nRequirements → planner.sh (iterates) → bd issues → ralph.sh (parallel) → Implemented code\n```\n\nBoth loops support `MAX_ITERATIONS` - planner defaults to 3, implementation defaults to 10.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Key principle**: Bash manages the iteration loop, each iteration gets fresh Claude context.\n\n```\nralph.sh (bash loop)\n├── Iteration 1\n│   ├── Spawn fresh Claude parent\n│   ├── Parent spawns subagents, then exits\n│   ├── Bash waits for subagent windows to close\n│   ├── bd sync\n│   └── Check bd ready → continue or done\n├── Iteration 2\n│   └── (repeat with fresh context)\n└── ...\n```\n\n1. Bash checks `bd ready` for available work\n2. Bash spawns fresh Claude parent for this iteration\n3. Parent runs `bd prime`, analyzes parallelizability\n4. Parent spawns subagent tmux windows (3-5 concurrent), then exits\n5. Bash waits for all subagent windows to close\n6. Each subagent implements ONE issue, commits, closes issue\n7. Bash syncs bd and loops until no work remains\n\n## Observer Commands\n\n```bash\n# Attach to see everything\ntmux attach -t ralph\n\n# Tile all panes\ntmux select-layout -t ralph tiled\n\n# Watch specific agent\ntmux select-window -t ralph:BD-123\n\n# Capture agent output\ntmux capture-pane -t ralph:BD-123 -p -S -1000 > agent.log\n\n# Kill stuck agent\ntmux kill-window -t ralph:BD-123\n\n# Kill entire session\ntmux kill-session -t ralph\n```\n\n## Planner Details\n\nThe planner (`scripts/planner.sh`) runs a **recursive loop** that iterates until the bd plan fully covers the input requirements:\n\n```\nwhile iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:\n    1. Read input plan file\n    2. Check current bd state (existing issues)\n    3. Compare: what's in the plan but missing from bd?\n    4. If nothing missing → exit with summary\n    5. Create missing issues with dependencies\n    6. Repeat\n```\n\nEach iteration the planner:\n1. **Re-reads the plan** - Keeps the source of truth in focus\n2. **Audits bd state** - What stories exist? What's missing?\n3. **Fills gaps** - Creates issues for uncovered sections\n4. **Sets dependencies** - Ensures correct build order\n\nThis ensures complex plans with many sections get fully decomposed into implementable stories.\n\n### Input Formats\n\n```bash\n# From file\nscripts/planner.sh requirements.md\nscripts/planner.sh feature-spec.txt\n\n# Inline (heredoc)\nscripts/planner.sh << 'EOF'\nAdd user authentication:\n- OAuth2 with Google and GitHub\n- Session management with JWT\n- Protected routes middleware\nEOF\n\n# One-liner\nscripts/planner.sh <<< \"Add dark mode with system preference detection\"\n\n# Pipe from anywhere\ncurl -s https://example.com/spec.md | scripts/planner.sh\ngh issue view 123 --json body -q .body | scripts/planner.sh\n```\n\n### What the Planner Creates\n\n```\nEpic: AUTH-001 \"Feature: OAuth2 Authentication\"\n├── AUTH-002 \"Add OAuth2 configuration\" [ready]\n├── AUTH-003 \"Create Google provider\" [depends: AUTH-002]\n├── AUTH-004 \"Create GitHub provider\" [depends: AUTH-002]\n├── AUTH-005 \"Add callback handlers\" [depends: AUTH-003, AUTH-004]\n└── AUTH-006 \"Add protected route middleware\" [depends: AUTH-005]\n```\n\nStories include:\n- Clear acceptance criteria\n- File paths to modify\n- References to existing patterns\n- Testing requirements\n\n## Watchdog (Active Health Monitor)\n\nThe watchdog is a separate Claude agent that monitors Ralph sessions and unsticks them automatically. Unlike the passive monitor, it takes action:\n\n```bash\n# Start watchdog for a ralph session (30 second check interval)\nscripts/watchdog.sh ralph-myproject 30\n\n# It runs in its own tmux window within the session\ntmux select-window -t ralph-myproject:watchdog\n```\n\nThe watchdog:\n- **Detects idle agents** - Looks for Claude CLI prompts indicating waiting state\n- **Checks issue status** - Queries bd to see if work is complete\n- **Nudges stuck agents** - Sends tmux keystrokes to prompt them to continue\n- **Kills completed windows** - Cleans up windows where the issue is closed\n- **Kicks the parent** - Sends Enter if parent is idle with work remaining\n\nThis keeps Ralph flowing autonomously without human intervention.\n\n## Passive Monitor (Logging Only)\n\nFor unattended runs where you just want logging without intervention:\n\n```bash\n# Start monitor (checks every 20 min, logs to /tmp/ralph-monitor.log)\nnohup scripts/monitor.sh 20 &\n\n# Check status\ntail -f /tmp/ralph-monitor.log\n```\n\nThe passive monitor detects:\n- **STOPPED**: Ralph session died unexpectedly\n- **STUCK**: Only parent window but work remains (2 consecutive checks)\n- **COMPLETE**: No ready work and only parent window\n- **RUNNING**: Normal operation with active subagents\n\n## bd Workflow\n\n### Setup Work\n\n```bash\n# Create epic\nbd create --type epic \"Feature: Dark Mode\"  # → BD-001\n\n# Create stories\nbd create \"Add theme toggle\" --parent BD-001 --priority 1\nbd create \"Add theme context\" --parent BD-001 --priority 2\nbd create \"Update components\" --parent BD-001 --priority 3\n\n# Add dependencies (bd ready respects these)\nbd dep add BD-004 BD-003  # BD-004 depends on BD-003\n```\n\n### Monitor Progress\n\n```bash\nbd ready              # What's workable?\nbd epic status BD-001 # Epic completion\nbd blocked            # What's stuck?\nbd activity           # Recent changes\n```\n\n### After Completion\n\n```bash\nbd list --state closed --parent BD-001  # All closed?\nbd show BD-002 --comments               # Review learnings\nbd epic close-eligible                  # Close the epic\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Right-Sized Stories\n\n```\nBAD:  \"Build authentication system\"\nGOOD: \"Add login form with email/password fields\"\n      \"Add client-side email validation\"\n      \"Create auth server action\"\n```\n\n### Clear Acceptance Criteria\n\nIn issue body:\n```\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] Email field with validation\n- [ ] Password field with show/hide\n- [ ] typecheck passes\n- [ ] tests pass\n```\n\n### Learnings Accumulate\n\nAgents add learnings via `bd comments`. Future iterations benefit:\n```bash\nbd show BD-005 --comments\nbd search \"migration pattern\"\n```\n\n## Not Suitable For\n\n- Exploratory work without clear criteria\n- Major refactors spanning entire codebase\n- Security-critical code\n- Anything needing human review before commit\n"
