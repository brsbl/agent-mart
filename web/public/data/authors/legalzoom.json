        "plugins/legalzoom/README.md": "# LegalZoom Plugin\n\nAI-powered business legal assistance — contract review, document analysis, and attorney consultation via LegalZoom.\n\n> **Disclaimer:** This plugin assists with legal workflows but does not provide legal advice. AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by qualified legal professionals before being relied upon for legal decisions.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/review-contract` | In-depth contract analysis with risk-scored findings and redline suggestions |\n| `/attorney-assist` | Connect with a LegalZoom attorney who sees your full conversation context |\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Review a contract** with `/review-contract` — upload a PDF, DOCX, or paste text and get risk-scored findings with suggested redlines\n- **Connect with an attorney** via `/attorney-assist` for any business legal matter — the attorney gets your full conversation and analysis to give you quality advice\n\n## Requirements\n\n- LegalZoom connector enabled in your Claude app settings\n- LegalZoom Business Attorney Plan for attorney consultations\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf LegalZoom MCP tools aren't connecting or aren't available, the most common fix is enabling the LegalZoom connector.
