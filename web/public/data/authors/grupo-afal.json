        "README.md": "# AFAL Claude Plugins\n\nPrivate Claude Code plugin marketplace for Grupo AFAL. This repository packages shared skills for distribution across AFAL Rails applications.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add Grupo-AFAL/afal-claude-plugins\n```\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install afal-rails-tools\n```\n\n## Included Agents\n\n### `dhh-code-reviewer`\nElite code reviewer channeling DHH's standards for Rails craftsmanship. Reviews Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Stimulus, and ViewComponent code. Used by `/architecture` and `/omc-rails-autopilot` for iterative review passes. Gives a \"Rails-worthy\" or \"needs changes\" verdict.\n\n### `rails-architect`\nFeature architecture specialist that generates comprehensive specs (models, controllers, views, tests). Produces deliberately over-engineered first drafts that get refined through DHH review iterations.\n\n## Included Skills\n\n### `/architecture`\nGenerates refined architecture specifications through iterative DHH review. Invokes the `rails-architect` agent to produce a comprehensive spec, then the `dhh-code-reviewer` agent to refine it over 3 iterations. Output: a Rails-worthy spec ready for implementation.\n\n### `/implement`\nStructured implementation from an approved architecture spec. Creates a todo list from the spec, implements step-by-step with tests after each change, runs full verification (tests, rubocop, brakeman), and gets a DHH code review before finalization.\n\n### `/review`\nCode review against DHH/37signals standards. Accepts a file, directory, glob, `--staged`, or `--branch`. Runs automated checks (Rubocop, Brakeman), invokes the `dhh-code-reviewer` agent, and produces a structured report with severity levels and actionable fixes.\n\n### `/omc-rails-autopilot`\nAutonomous development workflow for Rails applications following AFAL conventions. Fetches user stories from SmartSuite, implements features following Rails/Hotwire/Bali patterns, runs tests, and creates PRs.\n\n### `/bali-components`\nReference guide for Bali ViewComponents library. Provides accurate API documentation for forms, cards, modals, drawers, lists, and other UI components used in AFAL applications.\n\n### `/bali-view-audit`\nAudits view files for Bali component usage. Identifies missing components, incorrect patterns, and opportunities to use Bali instead of raw HTML.\n\n### `/pundit-authorization`\nMulti-tenant Pundit authorization patterns for AFAL apps. Covers OwnedByOrganization scoping, policy classes, role-based access, controller integration, and testing with Minitest fixtures.\n\n### `/hotwire-patterns`\nDecision guide and implementation patterns for Turbo Drive, Frames, Streams, and Stimulus in AFAL apps. Includes when to use each tool, Bali integration, and common anti-patterns.\n\n### `/afal-auth`\nOmniAuth-based authentication with AFAL IdP. Covers the complete auth flow, session management, route protection, multi-tenancy, and test helpers. Prevents suggesting Devise or local passwords.\n\n### `/solid-stack`\nDatabase-backed infrastructure with Solid Queue, Solid Cache, and Solid Cable (Rails 8.1). Covers job processing, caching strategies, WebSocket channels, and deployment considerations.\n\n### `/turbo-mount-react`\nReact islands architecture via the turbo-mount gem. Covers when to use React vs Hotwire, component mounting, props serialization, Turbo Stream compatibility, and cross-island communication.\n\n### `/api-endpoints`\nRESTful API development with Blueprinter serialization. Covers response structure, controller patterns, composable blueprint views, Pagy pagination, Ransack filtering, and testing API endpoints.\n\n### `/afal-concerns`\nCatalog of reusable Rails model concerns (OwnedByOrganization, Evidenceable, Auditable, Archivable, etc.). Covers composition patterns and when to create new concerns.\n\n### `/rails-migration-safety`\nZero-downtime database migration patterns. Covers safe column operations, multi-deploy rename/type-change processes, data migrations, rollback strategies, and strong_migrations integration.\n\n### `/rails-conventions`\nDHH-style Rails conventions enforcement for code reviews. Covers controller/model/view patterns, common anti-patterns, and a review checklist aligned with the Rails Doctrine.\n\n## Adding New Skills\n\n1. Create a new directory under `skills/`\n2. Add a `SKILL.md` file following Claude Code skill format\n3. Update this README with the skill description\n4. Bump version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n5. Commit and push changes\n\n## License\n\nUNLICENSED - Private internal use only.\n"
