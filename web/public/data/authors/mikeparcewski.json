Code review from senior engineers, architects, and security specialists. Brainstorming with AI focus groups. Guided workflows that clarify before they code. Search that understands your entire codebase. 18 plugins, each useful alone — transformative together.\n\n```bash\n# One command to get started\nclaude plugins add something-wicked/wicked-startah\n```\n\n```bash\n/wicked-crew:start \"Add user authentication with OAuth2\"\n#  Clarifies requirements → brainstorms approaches → finds existing patterns →\n#  builds with tracking → reviews for quality + security → remembers what it learned\n\n/wicked-jam:jam \"Redis vs Postgres for session storage?\"\n#  5 AI personas debate your question from different angles\n\n/wicked-engineering:review\n#  Senior engineer + architect + security review in one pass\n\n/wicked-mem:store --type decision \"Chose JWT — stateless, no session DB needed\"\n#  Surfaces automatically 47 sessions from now when someone asks about auth\n```\n\n## Why This Exists\n\nClaude Code is powerful but stateless. It forgets past decisions, skips requirements, and reviews its own code. Wicked Garden fixes that:\n\n| Problem | Without | With Wicked Garden |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| Amnesia | Every session starts from zero | Decisions, patterns, and preferences persist |\n| Solo perspective | One voice, one blind spot | Engineering, product, security, data specialists |\n| Cowboy coding | Jumps straight to implementation | Clarify → design → build → review |\n| Lost context | \"What did we decide about auth?\" | Auto-surfaces relevant memories |\n| No quality gates | Hope for the best | Shift-left QE with embedded gates |\n\n## The Plugins\n\n**Workflow & Memory**\n\n| Plugin | What It Does | Why It's Different |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| [wicked-crew](plugins/wicked-crew) | Dynamic multi-phase workflows with risk-aware scoring | Scores changes on 3 dimensions (impact, reversibility, novelty) — a hooks.json change gets treated as behavior-defining code, not \"just config\". Adapts phases and specialists based on actual risk |\n| [wicked-mem](plugins/wicked-mem) | Cross-session memory with typed categories and auto-decay | Only injects context when your question signals need — no context bloat, just relevant recall |\n| [wicked-kanban](plugins/wicked-kanban) | Persistent task board with sprint grouping and git commit linking | Built-in tasks reset every session — kanban remembers everything via PostToolUse auto-sync |\n| [wicked-jam](plugins/wicked-jam) | AI brainstorming with dynamic focus groups | 4-6 personas that build on each other's ideas — diverse trade-offs in 60 seconds, not a single voice |\n\n**Specialists** — like having senior ICs on call\n\n| Plugin | Roles | Why It's Different |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| [wicked-engineering](plugins/wicked-engineering) | Senior engineers, architects, debuggers, frontend/backend, tech writers | 10 specialist agents with coordinated multi-pass review — architecture + code quality + security in one command |\n| [wicked-product](plugins/wicked-product) | Product managers, UX designers, requirements analysts, customer advocates | Full customer voice pipeline: listen → analyze → synthesize, plus a11y audits and acceptance criteria |\n| [wicked-platform](plugins/wicked-platform) | SREs, security engineers, compliance officers, incident responders | Auto-discovers your observability stack (Sentry, Jaeger, Prometheus) via MCP — live metrics, not just static analysis |\n| [wicked-delivery](plugins/wicked-delivery) | Delivery managers, cost analysts, onboarding guides, rollout coordinators | Sprint health in seconds + personalized developer onboarding + A/B test design with statistical rigor |\n| [wicked-data](plugins/wicked-data) | Data engineers, ML engineers, analytics architects | DuckDB-powered SQL on 10GB+ CSV/Excel with zero database setup — plain English to results |\n| [wicked-qe](plugins/wicked-qe) | QE strategists, test automation, shift-left quality | Generates test scenarios from requirements before code exists + hooks that track file changes as you write |\n| [wicked-agentic](plugins/wicked-agentic) | Agentic architecture review, pattern detection, trust & safety | Detects 12 frameworks, scores agent topologies, generates remediation roadmaps for AI systems |\n\n**Search & Intelligence**\n\n| Plugin | What It Does | Why It's Different |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| [wicked-search](plugins/wicked-search) | Structural codebase understanding — 73 languages, PDF/Office docs, symbol graph with typed relationships | Trace a form field to its DB column, blast-radius analysis, architecture diagrams from Docker/K8s + code, lineage coverage audits, self-improving 95%+ accuracy |\n| [wicked-smaht](plugins/wicked-smaht) | Intercepts every prompt, detects intent, injects context from all installed plugins automatically | 6 adapters (memory, search, tasks, brainstorms, project state, docs), fast/deep path routing, session history condensation, turn-budget warnings — the brain that ties the ecosystem together |\n\n**Infrastructure & Tools**\n\n| Plugin | What It Does | Why It's Different |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| [wicked-cache](plugins/wicked-cache) | Shared caching layer with namespace isolation | File-aware invalidation — auto-expires when source files change, makes other plugins instant |\n| [wicked-startah](plugins/wicked-startah) | Starter kit with MCP servers and multi-AI conversations | One install gets Context7 docs, Atlassian integration, Gemini/Codex conversations, browser automation |\n| [wicked-workbench](plugins/wicked-workbench) | Web dashboard for browsing and executing plugin commands | ACP-powered React UI — browse all installed plugins and generate custom dashboards from plain English |\n| [wicked-scenarios](plugins/wicked-scenarios) | E2E testing via markdown scenarios | Human-readable test specs that orchestrate 9 CLIs (curl, playwright, k6, trivy, semgrep, pa11y) — no framework lock-in |\n| [wicked-patch](plugins/wicked-patch) | Code generation and change propagation | Add a field to a Java entity → auto-patches SQL migration + DAO + JSP + API + UI across 5 languages |\n\n## How They Work Together\n\n```\n  /wicked-crew:start \"Migrate auth from sessions to JWT across 3 services\"\n

gather requirements\n/wicked-platform:security                   # just scan for vulnerabilities\n```\n\n## Principles\n\n1. **Lightweight over heavyweight** — No ceremonies. Use what helps, skip what doesn't.\n2. **Guardrails over gates** — Prevents force pushes and secret commits without blocking flow.\n3. **Memory over amnesia** — Learns from past sessions. Builds context over time.\n4. **Perspectives over ego** — Multiple specialists catch what one voice misses.\n5. **Graceful degradation** — Every plugin works alone.

        "plugins/wicked-mem/README.md": "# wicked-mem\n\nTyped memory (decisions, patterns, preferences, episodes) with signal-based recall and automatic decay. Unlike built-in memory that bloats context with everything, wicked-mem only surfaces memories when your question signals relevance -- so session 47 remembers why you chose JWT without polluting session 3's CSS fix. It learns from your work automatically and never makes you repeat yourself.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install - starts working immediately via hooks\nclaude plugin install wicked-mem@wicked-garden\n\n# Store a decision\n/wicked-mem:store \"Use PostgreSQL for ACID transactions\" --type decision --tags database\n\n# Recall relevant memories\n/wicked-mem:recall \"database\"\n\n# Check what's remembered\n/wicked-mem:stats\n\n# Review a category\n/wicked-mem:review decision\n```\n\nAfter install, memory works automatically:\n- **Commits** trigger learning extraction\n- **Task completions** capture what you learned\n- **Questions about past decisions** pull relevant memories\n- **Old memories** decay naturally based on importance and access\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does | Example |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| `/wicked-mem:store` | Store a memory with type and tags | `/wicked-mem:store \"Always validate JWT on backend\" --type procedural --tags auth` |\n| `/wicked-mem:recall` | Search memories semantically | `/wicked-mem:recall \"authentication patterns\"` |\n| `/wicked-mem:review` | Browse and manage memories by category | `/wicked-mem:review decision` |\n| `/wicked-mem:stats` | Show memory statistics | `/wicked-mem:stats` |\n| `/wicked-mem:forget` | Archive or delete a memory | `/wicked-mem:forget mem_abc123` |\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Automatic Lifecycle\n\nHooks handle everything - no commands needed in normal workflow:\n\n| Event | What Happens |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Session start | Archives old memories, cleans up decayed ones |\n| Your prompt | Searches memories when you ask about past decisions |\n| Git commit | Extracts decisions and learnings automatically |\n| Task completion | Captures what you learned |\n| Session end | Suggests storing learnings from completed work |\n\n### Memory Types\n\n| Type | Purpose | Lifespan |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| **Decision** | Choices made and rationale | Permanent |\n| **Procedural** | How to do things, patterns | Permanent |\n| **Episodic** | What happened, what we learned | 90 days |\n| **Preference** | User/agent preferences | Permanent |\n| **Working** | Current session context | 1 day |\n\n### When Context Gets Injected\n\nMemory doesn't preload everything. It searches **on-demand** based on signals in your query:\n\n- \"How did we handle auth?\" → searches for auth-related decisions\n- \"What's our usual approach to...\" → searches procedural memories\n- \"Build a login page\" → no memory search (implementation, not recall)\n\n### Decay Strategy\n\nMemories fade naturally. Important, frequently-accessed memories last longer:\n\n```\neffective_ttl = base_ttl x importance_multiplier x access_boost\n```\n\nLifecycle: `active` → `archived` → `decayed` → `deleted`\n\n## Storage\n\nFile-based storage at `~/.something-wicked/memory/` - human-readable Markdown with YAML frontmatter. No database required.\n\n```\n~/.something-wicked/memory/\n├── core/                    # Global memories\n└── projects/{project}/      # Project-specific\n    ├── episodic/            # What happened (90-day TTL)\n    ├── procedural/          # How to do things\n    ├── decisions/           # Choices and rationale\n    └── working/             # Session context (1-day TTL)\n```\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent | When Invoked |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `memory-recaller` | User asks recall-oriented questions |\n| `memory-learner` | After task completion |\n| `memory-archivist` | Session start, maintenance |\n\n## Data API\n\nThis plugin exposes data via the standard Plugin Data API.

        "plugins/wicked-search/README.md": "# wicked-search\n\nwicked-search builds a structural understanding of your codebase that text search cannot. Trace a JSP form field to the exact database column it writes to, find every file affected by a column rename, and generate architecture diagrams from infrastructure manifests merged with code-inferred connections.\n\nUnlike grep or IDE search, wicked-search understands relationships. It indexes 73 languages via tree-sitter, extracts text from PDFs and Office documents, and links everything into a unified symbol graph with typed, confidence-tagged relationships. Cross-layer data flow tracing works across 8 ORM frameworks (JPA, SQLAlchemy, Django, TypeORM, Prisma, ActiveRecord, Entity Framework, GORM).\n\nA self-improving quality crew discovers symbol relationships until 95%+ of your codebase is mapped. One command to understand how data flows, what breaks when you change something, and where your architecture actually connects.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install\nclaude plugin install wicked-search@wicked-garden\n\n# Index your project\n/wicked-search:index .\n\n# Search everything\n/wicked-search:search \"authentication\"\n\n# Find what depends on a symbol\n/wicked-search:blast-radius UserService\n\n# Trace data flow from UI to database\n/wicked-search:lineage user.email\n\n# Quick pattern search (no index needed)\n/wicked-search:scout \"TODO|FIXME|HACK\"\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### Search\n\n| Command | What It Does | Example |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| `/wicked-search:index` | Build index for code + documents | `/wicked-search:index .` |\n| `/wicked-search:search` | Search across everything | `/wicked-search:search \"payment\"` |\n| `/wicked-search:code` | Search code symbols only | `/wicked-search:code \"AuthService\"` |\n| `/wicked-search:docs` | Search documents only | `/wicked-search:docs \"security requirements\"` |\n| `/wicked-search:refs` | Find references and documentation | `/wicked-search:refs validate_token` |\n| `/wicked-search:impl` | Find code implementing a spec | `/wicked-search:impl \"Authentication API\"` |\n| `/wicked-search:scout` | Quick pattern search (no index) | `/wicked-search:scout \"@Deprecated\"` |\n| `/wicked-search:stats` | Show index statistics | `/wicked-search:stats` |\n\n### Analysis\n\n| Command | What It Does | Example |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| `/wicked-search:blast-radius` | What depends on this symbol? | `/wicked-search:blast-radius UserService` |\n| `/wicked-search:lineage` | Trace data flow from UI to database | `/wicked-search:lineage user.email` |\n| `/wicked-search:impact` | What's affected if I change this? | `/wicked-search:impact EmailValidator` |\n| `/wicked-search:coverage` | Find gaps in lineage coverage | `/wicked-search:coverage` |\n| `/wicked-search:service-map` | Detect microservice architecture | `/wicked-search:service-map` |\n| `/wicked-search:validate` | Validate index accuracy | `/wicked-search:validate --deep` |\n| `/wicked-search:quality` | Agent-based quality crew to 95%+ accuracy | `/wicked-search:quality` |\n\n### Graph API\n\n| Verb | What It Does | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| `traverse` | BFS graph traversal from a symbol with depth/direction control | `api.py traverse graph <id> --depth 2 --direction both` |\n| `hotspots` | Rank symbols by connectivity (in-degree + out-degree) | `api.py hotspots graph --limit 10 --type entity` |\n\n### Multi-Project Isolation\n\nIndex multiple codebases separately with `--project`:\n\n```bash\n# Index with project scoping\n/wicked-search:index /path/to/project --project my-project\n\n# Query a specific project\napi.py list graph --project my-project\napi.py hotspots graph --project my-project\n\n# List all indexed projects\napi.py list projects\n```\n\nProject names: alphanumeric + hyphens, max 64 chars. Without `--project`, uses the legacy flat index (backward compatible).\n\n## What Makes It Different\n\nUnlike grep or IDE search, wicked-search understands your application's architecture:\n\n| Capability | wicked-search | grep/ripgrep | IDE Search |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------|\n| Text search | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Symbol-aware | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Cross-layer data flow | Yes | No | No |\n| ORM entity mapping | Yes | No | No |\n| Impact analysis | Yes | No | Partial |\n| Data lineage tracing | Yes | No | No |\n| Document cross-references | Yes | No | No |\n\n### Supported Technologies\n\n**Code**: 73 languages via tree-sitter (Python, Java, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C#, and more)\n\n**ORMs**: JPA, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, TypeORM, Prisma, ActiveRecord, Entity Framework, GORM\n\n**Frontend**: JSP/EL expressions, Vue SFC, React props\n\n**Documents**: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Markdown, HTML (via Kreuzberg)\n\n## Workflows\n\n### Understanding a Legacy Codebase\n\n```bash\n/wicked-search:index .\n/wicked-search:code \"@SpringBootApplication\"    # Find entry points\n/wicked-search:blast-radius LoginController     # Trace dependencies\n/wicked-search:docs \"architecture\"              # Find design docs\n```\n\n### Impact Analysis Before Changes\n\n```bash\n/wicked-search:blast-radius AuthenticationService  # What depends on this?\n/wicked-search:impact users.email                  # What uses this column?\n/wicked-search:lineage user.email                  # Trace full data flow\n```\n\n### Data Flow Analysis\n\n```bash\n# Trace from UI binding to database\n/wicked-search:lineage user.email\n# UI: login.jsp → Controller → Service → Repository → Entity → Database\n```\n\n## Data API\n\nThis plugin exposes data via the standard Plugin Data API.

Claude Code's built-in tasks reset every time you start a new conversation -- kanban auto-syncs via PostToolUse hooks, links commits to tasks, and maintains sprint grouping and activity audit trails that persist forever. Every TaskCreate and TaskUpdate flows to a durable board with full history.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install\nclaude plugin install wicked-kanban@wicked-garden\n\n# That's it - tasks sync automatically via hooks\n# Just use TaskCreate as normal, kanban tracks everything\n```\n\nAfter install, every task you create is automatically synced to a persistent kanban board with activity tracking.\n\n### Three Ways to Use\n\n**1. Automatic (Recommended)** - Tasks sync via hooks, zero effort:\n```bash\n# Use Claude's built-in task tools as normal\n# Kanban syncs automatically in the background\n```\n\n**2. Slash Commands** - Quick board access:\n```bash\n/wicked-kanban:board-status      # See current board state\n/wicked-kanban:new-task          # Create a task interactively\n/wicked-kanban:name-session      # Name this work session\n/wicked-kanban:start-api         # Start data API for workbench dashboards\n```\n\n**3.

A paper cut (impact=0, reversible=easy, routine=yes) gets a band-aid. A broken arm (impact=2, reversible=slow, first time=maybe) gets an X-ray, a specialist, and a follow-up plan. Crew does the same thing for code changes.\n\n**Example: \"Fix a typo in the README\"**\n- Impact: 0 — it's a doc file, not executable code\n- Reversibility: 0 — trivially reversible\n- Novelty: 0 — routine work\n- **Complexity: 0** → clarify → build → review (fast track)\n\n**Example: \"Migrate auth from sessions to JWT across 3 services\"**\n- Impact: 3 — touches auth handlers, API endpoints, middleware\n- Reversibility: 3 — schema migration + breaking API change\n- Novelty: 1 — multi-domain (security + architecture + complexity)\n- **Complexity: 7** → full pipeline with design, test-strategy, and all specialists\n\n**Example: \"Add a caching layer to the API\"**\n- Impact: 2 — new middleware + config changes\n- Reversibility: 1 — feature-flaggable, rollback mentioned\n- Novelty: 1 — two signal domains (performance + infrastructure)\n- **Complexity: 4** → adds design and test-strategy phases\n\n#### How Scoring Works\n\n**Impact** looks at *what files you're changing*, not their extension. A `.md` file in `commands/` is executable code (weight 2.0). A `.md` file in `docs/` is documentation (weight 0.5). The scorer uses a 5-tier taxonomy:\n\n| Tier | What | Weight | Examples |\n|------|------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Behavior-defining | 2.0 | commands/, hooks.json, Dockerfile, .github/workflows/, Makefile |\n| 2 | Source code | 1.5 | src/, scripts/, agents/, SKILL.md |\n| 3 | Generic code | 1.0 | .py, .ts, .go, .java, .rs |\n| 4 | Test code | 1.0 | tests/, spec/, e2e/ |\n| 5 | Low-impact | 0.5/0.0 | README, CHANGELOG, docs/, LICENSE |\n\nIntegration keywords (api, endpoint, service, system) add +2 because connecting systems is inherently high-impact.\n\n**Reversibility** balances irreversibility signals against mitigators:\n- \"Schema migration with breaking API change\" → +3 (migration) +3 (breaking change) = very hard to undo\n- \"Add feature-flagged experiment\" → +1 (experiment) -2 (feature flag) = easily reversible\n\n**Novelty** detects unfamiliar territory:\n- Explicit markers: \"prototype\", \"greenfield\", \"first time\", \"proof of concept\"\n- Cross-domain scope: 3+ signal categories means you're touching many concerns at once\n- Ambiguity: questions and uncertainty signal exploration is needed\n\n**The composite formula** that produces the 0-7 score:\n\n```\ncomplexity = impact + min(max(reversibility, novelty), 2) + scope + coordination\n```\n\nWhere scope (0-2) comes from description length and coordination (0-1) from stakeholder mentions. The `min(..., 2)` cap prevents risk dimensions alone from dominating.\n\n#### What Complexity Determines\n\n| Score | Phases | Specialists |\n|-------|--------|------------|\n| 0-2 | clarify → build → review | Minimal |\n| 3-4 | + design, test-strategy | Signal-matched |\n| 5-7 | + ideate, test, full gates | All relevant specialists engaged |\n\n#### Signals and Specialists\n\nThe scorer also detects 12 signal categories that determine which specialists to engage:\n\n| Signal | Detected From | Engages |\n|--------|--------------|---------|\n| Security | auth, encrypt, token, jwt, oauth | wicked-platform, wicked-qe |\n| Performance | scale, optimize, cache, latency | wicked-engineering, wicked-qe |\n| Product | requirement, feature, story, customer | wicked-product |\n| Compliance | soc2, hipaa, gdpr, pci, audit | wicked-platform |\n| Ambiguity | maybe, should we, options, tradeoff | wicked-jam |\n| Complexity | integration, migrate, distributed, legacy | wicked-delivery, wicked-engineering |\n| Data | analytics, database, etl, pipeline, ml | wicked-data |\n| Infrastructure | deploy, docker, kubernetes, terraform | wicked-platform |\n| Architecture | design pattern, api contract, cqrs, event-driven | wicked-agentic, wicked-engineering |\n| UX | user experience, accessibility, persona, wireframe | wicked-product |\n| Reversibility | migration, breaking change, deprecation | wicked-platform, wicked-delivery |\n| Novelty | prototype, greenfield, first time, research | wicked-jam, wicked-engineering |\n\nKeywords ending with `*` are stem-matched: `migrat*` catches \"migrate\", \"migration\", and \"migrating\".\n\n#### Project Archetypes\n\nScoring adjusts based on the **type of project** being changed. Different archetypes have different quality dimensions -- what matters for a content site is different from what matters for infrastructure.\n\n| Archetype | Quality Focus | Impact Bonus | Min Complexity |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| infrastructure-framework | Core execution paths affect all downstream users | +2 | 3 |\n| compliance-regulated | Audit trails, policy adherence, and risk documentation | +2 | 3 |\n| monorepo-platform | Cross-package impact, shared dependencies, versioning | +2 | 3 |\n| content-heavy | Messaging consistency, factual accuracy, brand voice | +1 | 2 |\n| ui-heavy | Design consistency, UX coherence, accessibility | +1 | 2 |\n| api-backend | Integration surface, contract stability, schema safety | +1 | 2 |\n| data-pipeline | Data quality, lineage tracing, downstream effects | +1 | 2 |\n| mobile-app | Platform constraints, UX patterns, release cycles | +1 | 2 |\n| ml-ai | Model quality, training data, evaluation rigor | +1 | 3 |\n| real-time | Latency, concurrency, state synchronization | +1 | 2 |\n\n**How it works**: When starting or executing a project, crew runs a dynamic pre-analysis that reads project files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json, etc.), queries memories, and analyzes codebase structure to detect archetypes. AGENTS.md is loaded first for general agent context, then CLAUDE.md for Claude-specific overrides. This happens BEFORE signal analysis.\n\n**Dynamic archetypes**: Beyond the built-in list, commands can define custom archetypes at runtime via `--archetype-hints`. A marketing team's landing page project can get a \"marketing-landing-page\" archetype that injects product and UX signals, even though that archetype isn't built-in.\n\n**Holistic merging**: When multiple archetypes are detected, MAX adjustments apply from ALL of them. A project that's both infrastructure-framework AND compliance-regulated gets the highest impact bonus and minimum complexity floor from both.\n\n**Example**: Modifying crew's scoring engine scored 1/7 without archetypes (no file references = zero impact). With infrastructure-framework archetype, it scores 3/7 because core execution path changes inherently have broad downstream impact regardless of code complexity.\n\n### Graceful Degradation\n\nCrew works fully standalone with built-in agents. Specialist plugins enhance it when available:\n\n| If Installed | Enhancement | Without It |\n|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| wicked-jam | AI brainstorming in clarify | Built-in facilitator |\n| wicked-engineering | Architecture + code review | Built-in reviewer |\n| wicked-product | Requirements + UX review | Built-in facilitator |\n| wicked-platform | Security + CI/CD checks | Built-in implementer |\n| wicked-qe | Test strategy + automation | Built-in reviewer |\n| wicked-delivery | PMO + risk tracking | Built-in researcher |\n\n## Workflows\n\n### Standard Project\n\n```bash\n# 1.

        "plugins/wicked-jam/README.md": "# wicked-jam\n\nOrganizational decision memory. Every brainstorm produces a searchable decision record -- what was decided, why, what alternatives were considered. Weeks later, revisit decisions to record whether they worked. Future brainstorms automatically surface past outcomes as evidence, so personas argue from your team's actual history instead of generic opinions. Decisions compound into institutional knowledge that vanilla Claude prompts can never accumulate.\n\n## The Decision Lifecycle\n\nThis is what makes wicked-jam different from \"just asking Claude to brainstorm\":\n\n```\nWeek 1:  /brainstorm \"caching strategy\"\n         → Personas debate with evidence from your codebase\n         → Decision record stored: \"Chose Redis, rationale: X, alternatives: Y, Z\"\n\nWeek 3:  /revisit \"caching strategy\"\n         → \"How did this work out?\" → Validated / Invalidated / Modified\n         → Outcome recorded with lessons learned\n\nWeek 6:  /brainstorm \"caching improvements\"\n         → Past decision + outcome surfaced automatically as evidence\n         → Personas cite: \"Redis was chosen in Week 1, validated in Week 3\"\n         → New decision builds on real history, not starting from zero\n```\n\nVanilla Claude forgets everything between sessions. wicked-jam accumulates decision intelligence over time.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install\nclaude plugin install wicked-jam@wicked-garden\n\n# Quick exploration (60 seconds, 4 personas)\n/wicked-jam:jam \"should we use Redis for sessions?\"\n\n# Full brainstorm with evidence + decision record (2-5 minutes)\n/wicked-jam:brainstorm \"authentication approaches for our API\"\n\n# Revisit a past decision to record its outcome\n/wicked-jam:revisit \"authentication\"\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does | Duration |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| `/wicked-jam:brainstorm` | Full session: evidence gathering, personas, synthesis, decision record | ~2-5 minutes |\n| `/wicked-jam:jam` | Quick exploration with 4 personas and lightweight record | ~60 seconds |\n| `/wicked-jam:perspectives` | Multi-perspective feedback, no synthesis | ~60 seconds |\n| `/wicked-jam:revisit` | Revisit a past decision and record its outcome | ~2 minutes |\n| `/wicked-jam:help` | Usage and examples | Instant |\n\n### When to Use What\n\n- **`/brainstorm`** - Significant decision that should be tracked and revisited later\n- **`/jam`** - Quick gut check, focused topic, limited time\n- **`/perspectives`** - Want raw viewpoints, you'll do your own synthesis\n- **`/revisit`** - A past decision needs outcome tracking (validated, invalidated, modified)\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Evidence Gathering\n\nBefore personas debate, the facilitator gathers real data:\n- **Past decisions** from wicked-mem: \"Last time we discussed auth, we chose JWT because...\"\n- **Code context** from your codebase: \"There are 3 existing cache implementations using pattern X\"\n- **Past outcomes** from wicked-mem: \"The Redis decision from Jan was validated after load testing\"\n\nThis evidence brief is injected into every persona's context. They cite your data, not generic opinions.\n\n### 2. Persona Assembly & Debate\n\n4-6 personas selected from archetypes, each armed with the evidence brief:\n\n| Archetype | Example Personas |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Technical | Architect, Debugger, Optimizer, Security Reviewer |\n| User-Focused | Power User, Newcomer, Support Rep |\n| Business | Product Manager, Skeptic, Evangelist |\n| Process | Maintainer, Tester, Documentarian |\n\n2-3 rounds of debate where personas build on and challenge each other's positions.\n\n### 3. Multi-AI Perspective (Optional)\n\nAfter persona rounds, optionally sends the synthesis to an external AI (Gemini/Codex via wicked-startah) for a contrasting viewpoint that gets integrated into the final output.\n\n### 4. Decision Record\n\nEvery brainstorm automatically stores a structured record:\n- **What was decided** and why\n- **Alternatives considered** with trade-offs\n- **Confidence level** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)\n- **Evidence used** in the discussion\n\nThis record is searchable, recallable, and automatically surfaced in future brainstorms.\n\n### Options\n\n```bash\n# Custom personas\n/wicked-jam:brainstorm \"error handling\" --personas \"Security,Tester,Debugger\"\n\n# Control discussion depth (1-5 rounds)\n/wicked-jam:brainstorm \"caching strategy\" --rounds 3\n```\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\n## Brainstorm: Authentication Approaches\n\n### Key Insights\n1. JWT with refresh tokens - HIGH confidence\n   - Stateless, scales well, industry standard\n   - Evidence: existing session middleware uses stateless tokens\n2. OAuth2 integration - MEDIUM confidence\n   - Good for third-party auth, more complex\n3. Session-based fallback - LOW confidence\n   - Simpler but doesn't scale\n   - Evidence: past decision on sessions was invalidated after load test\n\n### Action Items\n1. Prototype JWT implementation (2-3 days)\n2. Research OAuth2 providers\n3.

Requires wicked-kanban for task data; gracefully returns `{\"available\": false}` when kanban is not installed.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Breaks down task distribution by crew phase (clarify, design, test-strategy, build, test, review) and by signal dimension (security, architecture, data, etc.) from crew project signals. Detects phases from task subject prefixes and maps signals via crew's `project.json`. Available when both wicked-kanban and wicked-crew are installed.\n\n**Cost estimation** (opt-in): Run `/wicked-delivery:setup` or manually create `~/.something-wicked/wicked-delivery/cost_model.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"priority_costs\": { \"P0\": 2.50, \"P1\": 1.50, \"P2\": 0.75, \"P3\": 0.40 },\n  \"complexity_costs\": { \"0\": 0.50, \"1\": 0.75, \"2\": 1.00, \"3\": 1.50, \"4\": 2.00, \"5\": 3.00, \"6\": 4.50, \"7\": 6.00 }\n}\n```\n\nWhen configured, `stats metrics` includes cost/ROI fields. Without this file, no cost data is returned.\n\n**Commentary**: Auto-refreshed by a PostToolUse hook on task changes. Regenerates when metrics cross configurable thresholds with a cooldown period. Default thresholds: completion rate >10%, cycle time p95 >25%, throughput >20%, backlog aging crossing 10/20. Tune via `/wicked-delivery:setup` or `~/.something-wicked/wicked-delivery/settings.json`.\n\n## Integration\n\nWorks standalone.

        "plugins/wicked-smaht/README.md": "# wicked-smaht\n\nAI session memory that learns how you work. wicked-smaht remembers what you were doing across sessions, detects your intent from every prompt, and pre-loads exactly the context you need -- before you ask for it. No re-explaining, no re-searching, no lost context.\n\nA confidence-based router analyzes your prompt for debugging, planning, implementation, review, or research patterns, then pulls from 8 sources in parallel. Intent prediction anticipates what you'll need next based on workflow patterns (e.g., after two implementation turns, pre-loads review context). Cross-session memory persists your topics, decisions, and active files so returning to a project picks up where you left off -- even days later.\n\nEvery turn shows visible metrics: which sources were queried, how many items were pre-loaded, and what latency path was used. The `/debug` command reveals turn savings estimates and session state. The more plugins you install, the more sources it draws from -- but it works standalone as a session memory system.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install - that's it, works automatically via hooks\nclaude plugin install wicked-smaht@wicked-garden\n```\n\nAfter install, wicked-smaht runs automatically:\n- **On session start**: Loads your active project, tasks, and session context\n- **On every prompt**: Detects your intent, pulls relevant context from installed plugins\n\nNo commands needed for normal use. It just works.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does | Example |\n|---------|-------------|---------|\n| `/smaht` | Manually gather context | `/smaht` |\n| `/smaht --deep` | Force comprehensive context from all sources | `/smaht --deep` |\n| `/smaht --sources` | Show which adapters were selected and why | `/smaht --sources` |\n| `/onboard` | Codebase onboarding walkthrough | `/onboard` |\n| `/debug` | Show session state, routing stats, context preview | `/debug --state` |\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Cross-Session Memory\n\nWhen you end a session, wicked-smaht persists a summary: topics discussed, decisions made, active files, and current task. When you start a new session, it loads recent sessions so you never lose context:\n\n```\nPrevious sessions:\n  - caching, auth (15 turns, 2h ago) — Fix auth token validation\n  - search indexing (8 turns, 1d ago) — Build unified search index\n```\n\nThis works standalone -- no other plugins required.\n\n### Intent Detection & Prediction\n\nYour prompt is analyzed (no LLM calls, pure pattern matching) to determine what you need:\n\n| Intent | Triggers | What Gets Loaded |\n|--------|----------|-----------------|\n| Debugging | \"fix\", \"error\", \"bug\" | Related code, past fixes, active tasks |\n| Planning | \"design\", \"plan\", \"strategy\" | Project phase, brainstorms, architecture decisions |\n| Research | \"what is\", \"explain\", \"where\" | Code symbols, documentation, past learnings |\n| Implementation | \"build\", \"create\", \"add\" | Active tasks, code context, past patterns, delegation hints |\n| Review | \"review\", \"check\", \"PR\" | Code changes, test coverage, past reviews |\n\n**Intent prediction** tracks your workflow patterns and pre-loads bonus context for what's likely next. For example, after two consecutive implementation turns, review adapters are pre-loaded for the next turn.\n\n### Context Sources\n\nwicked-smaht pulls from whatever plugins you have installed:\n\n| Source | What It Provides | Required Plugin |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Memories | Past decisions, learnings, patterns | wicked-mem |\n| Tasks | Active work items, blockers | wicked-kanban |\n| Code | Symbol definitions, documentation | wicked-search |\n| Project | Current phase, goals, outcomes | wicked-crew |\n| Brainstorms | Past discussions, perspectives | wicked-jam |\n| Library docs | External API documentation | wicked-startah |\n| Delegation | Specialist routing hints | wicked-smaht (built-in) |\n| Context7 | Live framework documentation | wicked-startah |\n\nMissing plugins are silently skipped -- you get context from whatever is available.\n\n### Hot / Fast / Deep Path\n\n| Path | Sources | When Used |\n|------|---------|-----------|\n| **Hot** | Session state only (no adapters) | Continuations, confirmations (\"yes\", \"do it\", \"looks good\") |\n| **Fast** | 2-5 intent-specific adapters + predicted bonus | High confidence, focused queries |\n| **Deep** | All 8 adapters + history | Complex planning, ambiguous, or novel topics |\n\nThe router escalates to the deep path when it detects low confidence, competing intents, or references to past conversations. Short confirmations hit the hot path for instant responses using only the session \"ticket rail\" (current task, decisions, constraints, active files).\n\n### Proactive Suggestions\n\nEach turn may include at most one suggestion based on detected patterns:\n\n- **Past decisions**: If a relevant decision (relevance > 0.6) is found in memory, it's surfaced\n- **Delegation hints**: If a specialist plugin matches the current task, delegation is suggested\n\n### Visible Metrics\n\nEvery prompt response includes a metadata badge showing what happened:\n\n```\n<!-- wicked-smaht v2 | path=fast | 3 sources, 0 failed | 142ms | turn=7 -->\n```\n\nUse `/debug` to see full session metrics including estimated turn savings.\n\n## Example Context Briefing\n\nWhen you ask \"Fix the auth token expiration bug\", wicked-smaht generates:\n\n```\nIntent: debugging (confidence: 0.85)\nPath: Fast (debugging-focused adapters)\n\nFrom wicked-mem: \"Use JWT with 1h expiry, refresh tokens in Redis with 7d TTL\"\nFrom wicked-search: auth.py:validate_token() - decodes JWT, checks expiration\nFrom wicked-kanban: Task #12 \"Fix auth token validation\" - In Progress\n\nSuggestion: Related past decision found: \"JWT token strategy\"\n```\n\nThis context is injected before Claude responds, so you get informed answers without re-explaining.\n\n## Data API\n\nThis plugin exposes data via the standard Plugin Data API. Sources are declared in `wicked.json`.\n\n| Source | Capabilities | Description |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| sessions | list, get, stats | Session state with condensed context and routing history |\n\nQuery via the workbench gateway:\n```\nGET /api/v1/data/wicked-smaht/{source}/{verb}\n```\n\nOr directly via CLI:\n```bash\npython3 scripts/api.py {verb} {source} [--limit N] [--offset N] [--query Q]\n```\n\n## Integration\n\nWorks standalone as session memory. Enhanced with:\n\n| Plugin | Enhancement | Without It |\n|--------|-------------|------------|\n| wicked-mem | Past decisions, learnings, patterns surfaced per-turn | Session memory only, no long-term recall |\n| wicked-kanban | Active tasks, blockers in context | No task awareness |\n| wicked-search | Code symbols, documentation lookup | No code context |\n| wicked-crew | Project phase, goals, outcomes | No project awareness |\n| wicked-jam | Past brainstorm sessions and decisions | No brainstorm recall |\n| wicked-startah | External library docs via Context7 + delegation routing | No external docs, no delegation hints |\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
