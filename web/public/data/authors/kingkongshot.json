        "README.md": "> [!TIP]\n>\n> Don't want to read docs? After installation, tell Claude: `use loop to finish this task`.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n# Pensieve\n\n**Turn every intervention into an automation opportunity.**\n\n[![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kingkongshot/Pensieve?color=ffcb47&labelColor=black&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/kingkongshot/Pensieve/stargazers)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-white?labelColor=black&style=flat-square)](LICENSE)\n\n[Chinese README](https://github.com/mamajiaa/pensieve-claude-plugin/blob/zh/README.md)\n\n</div>\n\n## For Users Looking for the Linus Prompt\n\nThat methodology is still here and now delivered as an executable system:\n\n- Linus-style engineering principles are embedded as default execution rules\n- Core capabilities are mounted on the Claude Code runtime chain (`skills / hooks / task / agent`)\n- Code review is shipped as `run-when-reviewing-code` pipeline + knowledge\n\nYou get a full engineering package: prompting, workflow, and execution mechanics together.\n\n## What You Get Immediately\n\n- **Stronger breakthrough ability**: stubborn bugs move toward root-cause fixes\n- **Higher code quality**: cleaner, verifiable, maintainable output\n- **Harder code review**: the `run-when-reviewing-code` pipeline enforces a consistent standard\n- **More stable long sessions**: on-demand loading keeps context lean\n- **Less manual babysitting**: `/loop` splits, runs, and auto-continues tasks\n\n## 30-Second Start\n\n1. Install the plugin\n2. Initialize `.claude/pensieve/`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n4. Type `loop`\n\nQuick path (automation-first):\n\nShare this README link or full text with your model and give this instruction:\n\n`Complete Pensieve installation and initialization based on this README, then report the result.`\n\nThe model can execute installation, initialization, and verification steps automatically.\n\n- [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)\n- [Update Guide](docs/update.md)\n- [Init Tool](skills/pensieve/tools/init/_init.md)\n- [Upgrade Tool](skills/pensieve/tools/upgrade/_upgrade.md)\n- [Uninstall Section](docs/installation.md#uninstall)\n\n## Why This Stays Reliable\n\n### 1. Default principles drive execution\n\nThe system defaults prioritize root-cause repair, branch simplification, complexity control, and quality thresholds.\n\n### 2. Context is loaded on demand\n\nEach phase loads only what it needs: maxims for execution, review pipeline/knowledge for auditing, upgrade tool for migration.\n\n### 3. Built on Claude Code native capabilities\n\n- **Skills**: route intent to the right tool\n- **Hooks**: SessionStart injects routes, Stop handles auto-continue\n- **Task**: task state drives execution rhythm\n- **Agent**: main window decomposes work, sub-agents execute\n\nThis design gives two direct benefits:\n\n- **Lighter architecture**: native execution chain reduces wrapper complexity and maintenance overhead\n- **Upgrade compounding**: Pensieve gains from Claude Code native improvements over time\n\n## Minimal Commands to Learn\n\n- `/init`: initialize project-level `.claude/pensieve/` (first-time setup for new projects, includes review knowledge seed)\n- `/loop`: split complex work and execute in auto-loop mode\n- `/doctor`: run README-driven user-data health checks\n- `/pipeline`: list and invoke project pipelines\n- `/selfimprove`: turn lessons into system-level improvements\n- `/upgrade`: version update pre-check + legacy migration (highest priority; run `/doctor` after migration)\n\n## Best Fit Scenarios\n\n- Stubborn bugs that keep recurring\n- High-standard code review workflows\n- Long-running, complex project iterations\n- Teams that want to encode personal craft into default process\n\n## What Belongs in the Pensieve?\n\n**Maxim**: should pass all checks. Still valid across projects? across languages? across domains? useful for future unknown problems?\n\n**Decision**: keep it if any one of these is true. Would deleting it cause repeat mistakes? Would it help make a better choice in 3 months? Could you teach it as a reusable pattern?\n\n**Pipeline**: any task shape that appears repeatedly. Make it runnable first, then refine.\n\n## How Memory Evolves\n\n```text\nTemporary decisions in Loop -> filtered -> Decision\nRepeated similar Decisions -> distilled -> Maxim\nExternal knowledge + project practice -> Decision\nDecisions guide -> Pipeline improvement\n```\n\nLike memory revealing truth, what you store helps Claude understand your intent.\n\n## Community\n\n<img src=\"./QRCode.png\" alt=\"WeChat group QR code\" width=\"200\">\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
