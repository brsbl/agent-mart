        "README.md": "# ccconfigs\n\nPersonal configuration repository for Claude Code - a plugin marketplace containing essential tools and workflows.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Install the marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add dhruvbaldawa/ccconfigs\n   ```\n\n2. Set API keys (optional - for MCP servers):\n   ```bash\n   export PARALLEL_API_KEY=your_parallel_key       # Optional: Parallel Search\n   export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key   # Optional: Perplexity\n   ```\n\n3. Install plugins:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin\n   # Install \"essentials\", \"writing\", and optionally \"experimental\" from ccconfigs\n   ```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n**All MCP servers are optional.** The essentials plugin uses built-in tools (WebFetch, WebSearch) first, with MCP servers as fallback for advanced capabilities.\n\n**Parallel Search** (advanced web search with agentic mode):\n1. Get API key from [parallel.ai](https://parallel.ai)\n2. Set environment variable:\n   ```bash\n   export PARALLEL_API_KEY=your_key_here\n   ```\n\n**Perplexity** (AI-powered search):\n1. Get API key from [Perplexity API Console](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)\n2. Set environment variable:\n   ```bash\n   export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here\n   ```\n\nAdd these variables to your shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc) for persistence. Without these keys, built-in tools (WebFetch, WebSearch) still provide full functionality.\n\n### Global Configuration (Optional)\n\nThis repository includes global Claude Code configuration that can be shared across all projects:\n\n```bash\n# After cloning, run the setup script to create symlinks\n./setup-symlinks.sh\n```\n\nThis creates symlinks from `~/.claude/` to the `config/` directory in this repository, allowing you to:\n- Version control your global Claude Code settings\n- Edit your personal working rules from this repository\n- Sync configuration across machines\n\nThe script is idempotent - you can run it multiple times safely.\n\n**What gets symlinked:**\n- `config/CLAUDE.md` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (your global working rules)\n- `config/settings.json` → `~/.claude/settings.json` (global settings)\n\n### Install this marketplace\n\nIf this repository is hosted on GitHub:\n\n```bash\n# In any Claude Code session, run:\n/plugin marketplace add dhruvbaldawa/ccconfigs\n```\n\nIf using a local clone:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/dhruvbaldawa/ccconfigs.git\n# Or use your local path\n\n# In Claude Code, add the local marketplace:\n/plugin marketplace add /Users/dhruv/Code/ccconfigs\n```\n\n### Install plugins\n\nOnce the marketplace is added:\n\n1. Open the plugin menu: `/plugin`\n2. Browse available plugins from the ccconfigs marketplace\n3. Select and install plugins:\n   - **essentials**: For development workflows (MCP servers, task management, research, debugging/planning)\n   - **writing**: For blog post writing in Dhruv's style\n   - **experimental**: For complex development workflows with specialized agents (research, review)\n\nPlugins automatically configure all MCP servers, slash commands, skills, and agents.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository provides a structured plugin marketplace for Claude Code with three plugins:\n\n- **essentials**: Systematic development workflows including MCP servers, task management commands, research capabilities, and debugging/planning skills\n- **writing**: Conversation-driven blog writing workflow in Dhruv Baldawa's distinctive style\n- **experimental**: Multi-skill workflow system with 6 specialized agents for complex development tasks (research, code review)\n\n## Plugins\n\n### Essentials Plugin\n\nSystematic development workflows including MCP servers, task management commands, and debugging/planning skills.\n\n#### MCP Servers\n\nPre-configured integrations with Model Context Protocol servers. Built-in tools (WebFetch, WebSearch) are prioritized, with MCP servers as fallback for advanced capabilities:\n\n- **Parallel Search**: Advanced web search with agentic mode for complex queries, fact-checking, multi-source synthesis, and deep content extraction (optional API key)\n- **Perplexity**: AI-powered search for broad research and multiple perspectives (optional API key)\n- **Context7**: Library documentation lookup for official API references and technical specs (always available)\n- **Sequential-thinking**: Structured thinking framework for complex analysis (always available)\n\n**Research tool priority order:**\n1. **Built-in tools** (always available): WebFetch (specific URLs) / WebSearch (general searches)\n2. **Parallel Search** (optional): Advanced synthesis, fact-checking, agentic mode, deep extraction\n3. **Perplexity** (optional): Broad surveys\n4. **Context7** (always available): Official technical docs only\n\n#### Slash Commands\n\n- **`/breakdown [SPEC DOCUMENT]`**: Creates agile task breakdowns from design documents. Generates structured iteration plans with tasks, validation checklists, and LLM prompts.\n\n- **`/do [SPEC DOCUMENT] [TASK NUMBER | --resume] [CONTEXT] [--auto]`**: Executes tasks from spec documents. Updates task status to \"In Progress\", follows LLM prompts, validates completion. With `--auto` flag, automatically commits after each task and continues.\n\n- **`/optimize-doc [DOCUMENT]`**: Optimizes documentation for conciseness and clarity. Strengthens vague instructions, removes redundancy while preserving correctness. Can run idempotently across multiple passes.\n\n- **`/research [TASK FILE | QUESTION]`**: Research blockers or questions using specialized research agents. Analyzes question type and launches 2-3 agents in parallel (research-breadth for industry patterns, research-depth for specific solutions, research-technical for official docs). Uses research-synthesis skill to consolidate findings. For stuck tasks, updates task file with findings. For general questions, provides summary with sources.\n\n#### Utility Scripts\n\n**`manage-permissions.ts`**: Interactive tool for managing Claude Code permissions across projects. Auto-discovers projects by recursively scanning for `.claude/settings.local.json` files. Two modes: **promote** (default) moves permissions to global config, or **cleanup** removes permissions from project locals.\n\n**Promote permissions to global:**\n```bash\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts                    # From home dir\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts ~/Code ~/Projects  # From specific roots\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts --dry-run          # Preview only\n```\n\n**Remove permissions from projects:**\n```bash\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts --cleanup          # Remove permissions\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts --cleanup ~/Code   # From specific root\nbun scripts/manage-permissions.ts --cleanup --dry-run  # Preview only\n```\n\n#### Skills\n\n- **Debugging**: Systematic debugging framework using the UNDERSTAND methodology (10-step checklist). Focuses on root cause analysis over symptom treatment, with antipattern avoidance and reference materials.\n\n- **Technical Planning**: Risk-first development methodology that emphasizes \"what\" over \"how\". Four-phase approach covering requirements & risk analysis, milestone planning, implementation strategy, and execution framework.\n\n### Writing Plugin\n\nConversation-driven workflow for blog posts in Dhruv Baldawa's distinctive voice.\n\n#### Two-Document Workflow\n\nEvery blog post uses two files:\n\n- **braindump.md**: Collaborative workspace for research, notes, outline iterations, examples, and questions\n- **draft.md**: Clean, polished blog post in Dhruv's voice\n\n#### Slash Commands\n\n- **`/new-post [topic]`**: Initializes new blog post with `posts/[topic]/` directory containing braindump.md and draft.md templates. Starts brainstorming conversation.\n\n- **`/polish [topic or path]`**: Hybrid refinement workflow (suggest → confirm → apply). Runs quality checklist, presents 3-5 concrete improvements, waits for confirmation, applies approved changes. Can be run multiple times during writing.\n\n#### Skills\n\n- **blog-writing**: Transforms ideas from braindump to polished prose in Dhruv's voice - conversational yet analytical, grounded in personal experience, with clear structure optimized for Substack. Includes voice/tone principles, structure template, and quality checklist.\n\n- **brainstorming**: Collaborative ideation through questions and exploration. Starts with questions, explores tensions, challenges assumptions, helps refine vague ideas into concrete topics. Updates braindump.md as ideas evolve.\n\n- **research-synthesis**: Prioritizes built-in tools (WebFetch for URLs, WebSearch for general queries), uses MCP servers as fallback (Parallel Search for advanced synthesis, Context7 for technical docs). Synthesizes findings into narrative, integrates naturally during conversation, maintains source attribution.\n\n**Design philosophy**: Conversation-first workflow. Skills guide natural conversation, commands are utilities. Most operations happen through chat. Research tools used proactively during conversation. Flow: Brainstorming → Research → Drafting → Polishing.\n\n### Experimental Plugin\n\nMulti-skill workflow system using kanban file movement for complex, high-value development tasks. Features 6 specialized agents organized in 2 categories (research, review), all optimized for parallel invocation.\n\n#### Specialized Agents (6 total)\n\n**Research Agents** (3 agents - all haiku):\n- **research-breadth**: Broad surveys via WebSearch → Parallel Search → Perplexity (industry trends, consensus, multiple perspectives)\n- **research-depth**: Deep-dive via WebFetch → Parallel Search (specific URLs, implementation details, case studies)\n- **research-technical**: Official docs via Context7 (API references, method signatures, configurations)\n\n**Review Agents** (3 agents - all sonnet):\n- **test-coverage-analyzer**: Behavioral test gaps with 1-10 criticality ratings\n- **error-handling-reviewer**: Silent failures and poor error handling with severity levels\n- **security-reviewer**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities with 0-100 confidence scores\n\n#### Slash Commands\n\n- **`/plan-feature [REQUEST]`**: Sprint planning for `.plans/<project>/`. Same rigor whether starting fresh or continuing - always invokes technical-planning skill with full risk analysis. For continuing sprints, loads context from completed work and applies learnings.\n\n- **`/add-task [PROJECT] [TASK DESCRIPTION]`**: Adds a single ad-hoc task to an existing project's pending queue without full planning. Creates properly formatted task file with auto-incremented task number. Useful for adding tasks discovered during implementation. Prompts for project if not specified.\n\n- **`/implement-plan [PROJECT]`**: Executes tasks through kanban workflow (pending → implementation → review → testing → completed). Launches research agents when stuck, review agents (all 3) in parallel for comprehensive analysis.\n\n- **`/orchestrate [REQUEST]`**: End-to-end workflow from planning through completion. Combines `/plan-feature` and `/implement-plan` in single command with user confirmation between phases.\n\n#### Skills\n\n- **implementing-tasks**: Launches 2-3 research agents in parallel when stuck based on blocker type, consolidates findings using research-synthesis skill\n- **reviewing-code**: Launches all 3 review agents in parallel, consolidates findings by confidence/severity, decides APPROVE or REJECT\n- **testing**: Test suite execution and validation\n\n**Design philosophy**: Agents for specialized analysis with single, clear responsibilities. Skills orchestrate agents and consolidate findings. Parallel invocation reduces latency (2-3 research, 3 review agents together). Model optimization: Haiku for research (cost-efficient), Sonnet for review (quality-critical).\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nccconfigs/\n├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json  # Plugin marketplace definition\n├── config/                          # Global Claude Code configuration (symlinked to ~/.claude/)\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md                   # Global working rules\n│   └── settings.json               # Global settings\n├── setup-symlinks.sh               # Idempotent setup script for global config\n├── scripts/                        # Utility scripts\n│   └── manage-permissions.ts       # Interactive permission management\n├── .claude/                        # Project-specific configuration\n│   └── CLAUDE.md                  # Project instructions\n├── essentials/                     # The essentials plugin\n│   ├── .mcp.json                  # MCP server configuration\n│   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json # Plugin metadata\n│   ├── commands/                  # Slash command definitions\n│   │   ├── breakdown.md\n│   │   ├── do.md\n│   │   ├── optimize-doc.md\n│   │   └── research.md            # Research using specialized agents\n│   └── skills/                    # Development skills\n│       ├── brainstorming/         # Collaborative ideation\n│       │   ├── SKILL.md\n│       │   └── reference/\n│       ├── debugging/             # UNDERSTAND methodology\n│       │   ├── SKILL.md\n│       │   └── reference/\n│       ├── engineering-prompts/   # Prompt engineering methodology\n│       │   └── SKILL.md\n│       ├── research-synthesis/    # MCP tool integration\n│       │   ├── SKILL.md\n│       │   └── reference/\n│       │       └── multi-agent-invocation.md  # Multi-agent patterns\n│       ├── technical-planning/    # Risk-first planning\n│       │   └── SKILL.md\n│       └── writing-documentation/ # Documentation best practices\n│           └── SKILL.md\n├── writing/                        # The writing plugin\n│   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json # Plugin metadata\n│   ├── commands/                  # Slash command definitions\n│   │   ├── new-post.md            # Initialize blog post\n│   │   └── polish.md              # Hybrid refinement\n│   └── skills/                    # Writing skills\n│       └── blog-writing/          # Dhruv's voice and style\n│           └── SKILL.md\n└── experimental/                   # The experimental plugin\n    ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json # Plugin metadata\n    ├── agents/                    # Specialized agents (6 total)\n    │   ├── research/              # Research agents (parallel invocation)\n    │   │   ├── research-breadth.md\n    │   │   ├── research-depth.md\n    │   │   └── research-technical.md\n    │   └── review/                # Code review agents\n    │       ├── test-coverage-analyzer.md\n    │       ├── error-handling-reviewer.md\n    │       └── security-reviewer.md\n    ├── commands/                  # Workflow commands\n    │   ├── plan-feature.md\n    │   ├── add-task.md\n    │   ├── implement-plan.md\n    │   └── orchestrate.md\n    └── skills/                    # Workflow skills\n        ├── implementing-tasks/\n        ├── reviewing-code/\n        └── testing/\n```\n",
        "experimental/README.md": "# Experimental: Multi-Skill Development Workflows\n\n**Status:** Experimental (v0.3.0)\n**Architecture:** Kanban Flow (File Movement = Handoff) + Skills (Visibility + Interaction)\n\nMulti-skill orchestration plugin coordinating specialized skills via physical file movement. Task files move between directories like a Kanban board: `pending/` → `implementation/` → `review/` → `testing/` → `completed/`.\n\n**Key improvement:** Skills run in main conversation (full visibility) instead of isolated subagents (black box).\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Plan a feature\n/plan-feature Add user authentication with JWT\n\n# Add ad-hoc task to existing project\n/add-task user-authentication Add email verification\n\n# Execute the plan\n/implement-plan user-authentication\n\n# Or do both planning and implementation\n/orchestrate Build real-time notifications\n```\n\n## Architecture: Skills + Kanban Flow\n\n**Core concepts:**\n- **File location = workflow stage** (pending/implementation/review/testing/completed)\n- **Status field = completion state** (Pending → READY_FOR_REVIEW → APPROVED → COMPLETED)\n- **Skills update task files** with status and detailed notes\n- **Orchestrator moves files** between directories based on status\n- **Everything visible** in main conversation (no hidden subagent execution)\n\n```\n.plans/user-auth/\n├── plan.md\n├── pending/              # Tasks waiting\n│   └── 002-login.md\n├── implementation/       # Being coded\n│   └── 003-jwt-middleware.md\n├── review/              # Code review\n│   └── 004-rate-limit.md\n├── testing/             # Test writing\n│   └── 005-password-reset.md\n└── completed/           # Done\n    └── 001-user-model.md\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n```\npending → implementation → review → testing → completed\n            ↓                ↓\n            └────────────────┘ (rejection: move back)\n```\n\n**Agents move files as handoffs:**\n```bash\n# Implementation claims task\nmv pending/002-login.md implementation/002-login.md\n\n# Implements, then hands off to review\nmv implementation/002-login.md review/002-login.md\n\n# Review approves, hands to testing\nmv review/002-login.md testing/002-login.md\n\n# Testing completes\nmv testing/002-login.md completed/002-login.md\n```\n\n## Three Specialized Skills\n\n### 1. Implementation Skill\n- Receives task file path from orchestrator\n- **Follows LLM Prompt block step-by-step**\n- Writes code + tests together (prevent regressions)\n- **Updates task file:** Status → \"READY_FOR_REVIEW\", appends implementation notes\n- Marks **Status: STUCK** if blocked, reports blocker\n- **Runs in main conversation** → you see code being written, tests running\n\n### 2. Review Skill\n- Receives task file path from orchestrator\n- **Fresh eyes** - reviews outputs (diff, tests) not implementation notes\n- Checks security (OWASP Top 10), quality, performance, test coverage\n- Verifies **Working Result** achieved and **Validation** checklist complete\n- **Updates task file:** Status → \"APPROVED\" or \"REJECTED\", appends review notes with scores\n- **Runs in main conversation** → you see security analysis, quality checks\n\n### 3. Testing Skill\n- Receives task file path from orchestrator\n- Validates existing tests (implementation already wrote them)\n- Adds missing edge cases only (minimal, no test bloat)\n- Verifies behavior-focused (not implementation details)\n- Checks coverage >80% statements, >75% branches\n- **Updates task file:** Status → \"COMPLETED\", appends testing notes with coverage\n- **Runs in main conversation** → you see test validation, coverage reports\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n### `/plan-feature [REQUEST]`\nSprint planning for `.plans/<project>/` - same rigor whether starting fresh or continuing.\n- Always invokes **technical-planning skill** (from essentials) with full risk analysis\n- For continuing sprints: loads context from completed work, applies learnings\n- Generates outcome-focused task files in `pending/` (WHAT and WHY, not HOW)\n- Documents deferred items with rationale\n\n**Examples:**\n- `/plan-feature Add user authentication with JWT` (initial sprint)\n- `/plan-feature user-auth` (continuing sprint - loads context first)\n\n### `/add-task [PROJECT] [TASK DESCRIPTION]`\nAdds a single ad-hoc task to an existing project without full planning workflow.\n- Auto-increments task number by scanning existing tasks\n- Creates properly formatted task file in `pending/`\n- Prompts for project if not specified\n- Simpler than `/plan-feature` - no risk analysis, just scaffolds task structure\n- Useful for tasks discovered during implementation\n\n**Examples:**\n- `/add-task auth Add rate limiting to login endpoint`\n- `/add-task Add email verification` (prompts for project)\n\n### `/implement-plan [PROJECT] [--auto]`\nExecutes tasks through kanban workflow (pending → implementation → review → testing → completed).\n- Creates granular sub-todos for each task\n- Launches research agents when stuck\n- Launches all 3 review agents in parallel for comprehensive analysis\n- With `--auto` flag: automatically commits and continues to next task\n- Without flag: stops after each task for human review\n\n**Example:** `/implement-plan user-authentication --auto`\n\n### `/orchestrate [REQUEST]`\nEnd-to-end workflow from planning through completion.\n- Combines `/plan-feature` and `/implement-plan`\n- User confirmation between phases\n\n**Example:** `/orchestrate Build real-time notifications`\n\n## Task File (Single Source of Truth)\n\n```markdown\n# Task 002: Implement Login Endpoint\n\n**Iteration:** Foundation\n**Status:** Pending\n**Dependencies:** 001\n**Files:** src/routes/auth.ts, tests/auth.test.ts\n\n## Description\nPOST /api/auth/login accepting email/password, returning JWT.\n\n## Working Result\nUser can login via POST /api/auth/login with valid credentials and receive JWT token.\n\n## Validation\n- [ ] Valid login returns 200 + JWT token\n- [ ] Invalid password returns 401\n- [ ] Rate limit returns 429 (5 req/min)\n- [ ] All tests passing (no regressions)\n\n## LLM Prompt\n<prompt>\n1. Read **src/middleware/auth.ts** to understand existing auth patterns\n2. Create **src/routes/auth.ts** with POST /login endpoint\n3. Implement email validation (valid format)\n4. Implement bcrypt password verification\n5. Generate JWT token (24h expiry, HS256 algorithm)\n6. Add rate limiting using express-rate-limit (5 req/min per IP)\n7. Write tests in **tests/auth.test.ts**:\n   - Valid login returns 200 + token\n   - Invalid password returns 401\n   - Missing email returns 400\n   - Rate limit blocks 6th request\n8. Run full test suite: `npm test`\n</prompt>\n\n## Notes\n\n**planning-agent:** Follow auth patterns in src/middleware/. Rate limiting required for OWASP A04.

Glob and count.\n\n## Token Economics\n\nMulti-agent uses **15× more tokens** than single-agent. Optimizations:\n\n**Model Selection** (60% savings):\n- Haiku workers: $1/$5 per M tokens\n- Sonnet orchestration/review: $3/$15 per M tokens\n\n**Prompt Caching** (75% savings):\n```typescript\n// Static content first\nconst prompt = `\n${CLAUDE_MD}        // Cached\n${AGENT_GUIDELINES} // Cached\n---\nTask: ${dynamic}    // Not cached (small)\n`;\n```\n\n**Progressive Disclosure** (90% savings):\n- Agent loads only current task file\n- Not all 20 tasks\n\n**Typical Costs (Optimized):**\n- Simple (6 tasks): $0.45-0.80\n- Medium (12 tasks): $0.95-2.00\n- Complex (25 tasks): $2.80-4.50\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Complexity Score:**\n```\nFiles to change: _____ × 1\nNew patterns:    _____ × 3\nSecurity risk:   _____ × 5\nIntegration:     _____ × 2\n```\n\n- **< 10 points:** Single agent (simpler, cheaper)\n- **10-20 points:** Multi-agent justified\n- **> 20 points:** Multi-agent + architecture planning\n\n**Use when:**\n- Complex features (>10 tasks)\n- Security-critical (authentication, payments)\n- High integration complexity\n- Task value justifies 15× cost\n\n**Don't use when:**\n- Simple changes (1-2 files)\n- Quick fixes\n- Documentation updates\n- Budget constraints\n\n## Benefits Over Previous Subagent Architecture\n\n### Visibility\n- ✅ **See everything:** Skills run in main conversation\n- ✅ **Real-time progress:** Watch code being written, tests running, reviews happening\n- ❌ **Before:** Subagents ran in isolated contexts (black box)\n\n### Interaction\n- ✅ **Natural interruption:** Say \"wait, that's wrong\" anytime\n- ✅ **Course correction:** Guide skills mid-execution\n- ❌ **Before:** Could only resume via agentId (clunky)\n\n### Kanban Flow\n- ✅ **Guaranteed movement:** Orchestrator moves files based on status\n- ✅ **Single source of truth:** Task file contains full history\n- ❌ **Before:** Agents told to move files (not enforced)\n\n### Additional Benefits\n1. **Visual Kanban:** `ls .plans/project/*/` shows workflow state\n2. **O(1) Discovery:** Orchestrator knows exactly which directory to check\n3. **No Redundancy:** File location = workflow stage, Status field = completion state\n4. **Atomic Handoffs:** `mv` is atomic operation\n5. **Git History:** Task journey visible in git log with all skill notes\n6. **Natural Rejection:** Moving file back is explicit\n7. **Resume anytime:** Just run `/implement-plan <project>` again\n\n## Example: Simple Auth Feature\n\n```bash\n/plan-feature Add user authentication with JWT\n```\n\n**Planning agent creates:**\n```\n.plans/user-auth/\n├── plan.md\n└── pending/\n    ├── 001-user-model.md\n    ├── 002-login-endpoint.md\n    ├── 003-jwt-middleware.md\n    ├── 004-rate-limiting.md\n    ├── 005-password-reset.md\n    └── 006-tests.md\n```\n\n**Execute:**\n```bash\n/implement-plan user-auth\n```\n\n**Flow:**\n1. Implementation claims 001 (no dependencies)\n2. `mv pending/001-*.md implementation/001-*.md`\n3. Creates User model with bcrypt\n4. `mv implementation/001-*.md review/001-*.md`\n5. Review checks security, approves\n6. `mv review/001-*.md testing/001-*.md`\n7. Testing writes 12 unit tests, 94% coverage\n8. `mv testing/001-*.md completed/001-*.md`\n9. Repeat for 002-006\n\n**Add task mid-implementation:**\n```bash\n# Discovered we need email verification\n/add-task user-auth Add email verification to registration flow\n```\n\nCreates `007-add-email-verification.md` in `pending/`, ready to be implemented after current tasks complete.\n\n**Result:**\n```\n.plans/user-auth/\n├── plan.md\n├── pending/         (empty)\n├── implementation/  (empty)\n├── review/          (empty)\n├── testing/         (empty)\n└── completed/\n    ├── 001-user-model.md\n    ├── 002-login-endpoint.md\n    ├── 003-jwt-middleware.md\n    ├── 004-rate-limiting.md\n    ├── 005-password-reset.md\n    └── 006-tests.md\n```\n\n**Git log shows full task journey!**\n\n## Rejection Example\n\n```markdown\n## Notes\n\n**implementation-agent:** Implemented login endpoint\n\n**review-agent:**\nSecurity: 65/100\nREJECTED - Missing rate limiting (OWASP A04)\n→ Moving back to implementation\n\n**implementation-agent:** Added express-rate-limit (5 req/min). Resubmitting.\n\n**review-agent:**\nSecurity: 90/100\nAPPROVED → testing\n```\n\n**File moves:**\n1. `pending/002-*.md`\n2. → `implementation/002-*.md` (claimed)\n3. → `review/002-*.md` (submitted)\n4. → `implementation/002-*.md` (rejected, moved back!)\n5. → `review/002-*.md` (resubmitted)\n6. → `testing/002-*.md` (approved)\n7. → `completed/002-*.md` (done)\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Sequential execution only (no automatic parallelization)\n- Manual conflict detection\n- No built-in cost budgeting\n- Experimental status (expect rough edges)\n\n## Files\n\n**Skills:** `skills/*/SKILL.md` (implementing-tasks, reviewing-code, testing)\n**Commands:** `commands/*.md` (plan-feature, add-task, implement-plan, orchestrate)\n**Templates:** `templates/*.md` (plan, task, milestones)\n\n## References\n\n- `.plans-structure-design.md` - Detailed Kanban structure specification\n- Commands contain orchestration logic and Kanban flow patterns\n\n---\n\n## Migration from v0.2.0 (Subagents)\n\n**v0.3.0 changes:**\n- ✅ Agents converted to skills (run in main conversation)\n- ✅ Commands refactored to invoke skills instead of Task tool\n- ✅ Orchestrator explicitly handles file movement\n- ✅ Skills update task files with status and notes\n- ✅ Full visibility and interaction throughout workflow\n\n**Old agents still available** in `agents/` directory but deprecated.\n\n**Breaking changes:**\n- Commands no longer use `await Task({ subagent_type: '...' })`\n- Commands now invoke skills and handle orchestration directly\n- Better visibility but slightly different invocation pattern\n\n---\n\n**Ultra-lean, token-efficient multi-skill workflows via Kanban file movement. Use strategically for complex, high-value tasks with full visibility.**\n"
