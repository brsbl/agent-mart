It turns Claude Code into a proactive project manager that follows a strict protocol to specify, plan, and implement software features and bug fixes.\n\nInstead of just writing code, Conductor ensures a consistent, high-quality lifecycle for every task: **Context -> Spec & Plan -> Implement**.\n\nThe philosophy behind Conductor is simple: control your code. By treating context as a managed artifact alongside your code, you transform your repository into a single source of truth that drives every agent interaction with deep, persistent project awareness.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Plan before you build**: Create specs and plans that guide the agent for new and existing codebases.\n- **Maintain context**: Ensure AI follows style guides, tech stack choices, and product goals.\n- **Iterate safely**: Review plans before code is written, keeping you firmly in the loop.\n- **Work as a team**: Set project-level context for your product, tech stack, and workflow preferences that become a shared foundation for your team.\n- **Build on existing projects**: Intelligent initialization for both new (Greenfield) and existing (Brownfield) projects.\n- **Codebase Pattern Analysis**: Automatically detect and document existing code patterns, architecture conventions, and testing practices for brownfield projects.\n- **Smart revert**: A git-aware revert command that understands logical units of work (tracks, phases, tasks) rather than just commit hashes.\n- **Universal File Resolution Protocol (UFRP)**: Flexible file organization with dynamic path resolution via index files, allowing customization of your project structure.\n- **Pattern Reference Layer**: Reusable best-practice patterns that are automatically surfaced during implementation based on task context.\n- **AI-Optimized Templates**: Dual-format patterns and styleguides with AI Quick Reference sections, plus a searchable snippet library.\n- **Skill Ecosystem**: Extensible skill plugin architecture with reference skills for typescript-best-practices, api-design, and testing-strategies that provide domain-specific guidance.\n- **Quality Intelligence**: Automated anti-pattern detection and coverage analysis with actionable test suggestions during implementation.\n- **Decision Logging**: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) logging that captures the \"why\" behind implementation choices for self-documenting codebases.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the Marketplace (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add rbarcante/claude-conductor\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install conductor@claude-conductor\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n```bash\n# Option 1: Project-specific installation\ncp -r claude-conductor ~/.claude/plugins/conductor\n\n# Option 2: Use with --plugin-dir flag\ncc --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-conductor\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nConductor is designed to manage the entire lifecycle of your development tasks.\n\n**Note on Token Consumption:** Conductor's context-driven approach involves reading and analyzing your project's context, specifications, and plans. This can lead to increased token consumption, especially in larger projects or during extensive planning and implementation phases.\n\n### 1. Set Up the Project (Run Once)\n\nWhen you run `/conductor:setup`, Conductor helps you define the core components of your project context. This context is then used for building new components or features by you or anyone on your team.\n\n- **Product**: Define project context (e.g. users, product goals, high-level features).\n- **Product guidelines**: Define standards (e.g. prose style, brand messaging, visual identity).\n- **Tech stack**: Configure technical preferences (e.g. language, database, frameworks).\n- **Workflow**: Set team preferences (e.g. TDD, commit strategy). Uses [workflow.md](templates/workflow.md) as a customizable template.\n\n**Generated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/product.md`\n- `conductor/product-guidelines.md` (includes codebase patterns for brownfield)\n- `conductor/tech-stack.md`\n- `conductor/workflow.md`\n- `conductor/code_styleguides/`\n- `conductor/docs/` (pattern documentation for brownfield projects)\n- `conductor/tracks.md`\n- `conductor/index.md` (navigation index)\n\n```bash\n/conductor:setup\n```\n\n### 2. Start a New Track (Feature or Bug)\n\nWhen you're ready to take on a new feature or bug fix, run `/conductor:newTrack`. This initializes a **track** — a high-level unit of work. Conductor helps you generate two critical artifacts:\n\n- **Specs**: The detailed requirements for the specific job. What are we building and why?\n- **Plan**: An actionable to-do list containing phases, tasks, and sub-tasks.\n\n**Generated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md`\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/decisions.md` (ADR logging)\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json`\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/index.md` (track navigation index)\n\n```bash\n/conductor:newTrack\n# OR with a description\n/conductor:newTrack \"Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page\"\n```\n\n### 3. Implement the Track\n\nOnce you approve the plan, run `/conductor:implement`. Your coding agent then works through the `plan.md` file, checking off tasks as it completes them.\n\n**Updated Artifacts:**\n- `conductor/tracks.md` (Status updates)\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md` (Status updates)\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/review.md` (Auto code review on completion)\n- Project context files (Synchronized on completion)\n\n```bash\n/conductor:implement\n```\n\nConductor will:\n1.  Select the next pending task.\n2.  Follow the defined workflow (e.g., TDD: Write Test -> Fail -> Implement -> Pass).\n3.  Update the status in the plan as it progresses.\n4.  **Verify Progress**: Guide you through a manual verification step at the end of each phase to ensure everything works as expected.\n5.  **Auto Code Review**: When all tasks are complete, automatically trigger a code review analyzing quality, security, and test coverage. The report is saved to `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/review.md`. This step is non-blocking — you can skip it or proceed regardless of findings.\n\nDuring implementation, you can also:\n\n- **Check status**: Get a high-level overview of your project's progress.\n  ```bash\n  /conductor:status\n  ```\n- **Revert work**: Undo a feature or a specific task if needed.\n  ```bash\n  /conductor:revert\n  ```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n| Command | Description | Artifacts |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `/conductor:setup` | Scaffolds the project and sets up the Conductor environment.

If relevant patterns are found, they're surfaced before you begin the task:\n\n```\n📚 **Relevant Patterns Detected:**\n\n1. **Error Handling** (patterns/core/error-handling.md)\n   > Exception handling, error propagation, user-friendly messages\n\n[Apply patterns? (Y)es / (S)kip / (V)iew first]\n```\n\n### Core Patterns\n\nThe following patterns are included out of the box:\n\n| Pattern | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Error Handling | Exception handling, error propagation, user-friendly messages |\n| Logging | Log levels, structured logging, context inclusion |\n| Configuration | Config management, environment variables, secrets handling |\n| Validation | Input validation, schema validation, error messages |\n| Testing | Test structure, mocking, assertions, coverage strategies |\n\n### Browse Patterns\n\nUse the patterns command to explore available patterns:\n\n```bash\n# List all patterns\n/conductor:patterns list\n\n# Search for patterns by keyword\n/conductor:patterns search validation\n\n# View a specific pattern\n/conductor:patterns show error-handling\n```\n\n### Adding Custom Patterns\n\nCreate new patterns in `patterns/core/` or `patterns/stack/` using the template at `patterns/TEMPLATE.md`. Each pattern includes:\n\n- **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata and activation keywords\n- **AI Quick Reference**: Concise guidance for the AI agent\n- **Human Documentation**: Detailed explanations and examples\n- **Anti-Patterns**: Common mistakes to avoid\n\n## AI-Optimized Templates\n\nConductor includes AI-optimized templates that follow a **Dual-Format Standard** - every template contains both a concise AI Quick Reference section and detailed human documentation.\n\n### Dual-Format Standard\n\nAll patterns, styleguides, and documentation follow this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# Document Title\n\n## AI Quick Reference\n[Structured, scannable content - max 30-50 lines]\n[Tables, bullet lists, minimal code examples]\n\n---\n\n## Human Documentation\n[Detailed explanations, examples, rationale]\n```\n\nThis design ensures:\n- **Fast AI parsing**: Key rules immediately accessible at the top\n- **Complete documentation**: Detailed explanations for human readers\n- **Consistent structure**: Predictable format across all templates\n\n### AI-Enhanced Styleguides\n\nAll code styleguides in `templates/code_styleguides/` include AI Quick Reference sections (max 30 lines) with:\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|:--------|:--------|\n| **Language Rules** | Core syntax and conventions (6-10 items) |\n| **Type Patterns** | Type system best practices (5-8 items) |\n| **Avoid** | Anti-patterns and common mistakes (4-6 items) |\n\nAvailable styleguides: TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Go, General\n\n### Snippet Library\n\nConductor includes a reusable code snippet library with AI-optimized headers:\n\n```bash\n# List all snippets\n/conductor:snippet list\n\n# Search snippets by keyword\n/conductor:snippet search api client\n\n# View a specific snippet\n/conductor:snippet show api-client.ts\n```\n\n#### Snippet Categories\n\n| Category | Contents |\n|:---------|:---------|\n| **TypeScript** | api-client, error-handler, type-guard, async-wrapper, config-loader |\n| **Python** | api-client, error-handler, dependency-injection, config-loader, async-patterns |\n| **Patterns** | repository-pattern, factory-pattern |\n\n#### Snippet AI Headers\n\nEach snippet includes an AI header with:\n- **USE**: When to use this snippet\n- **REQUIRES**: Dependencies and prerequisites\n- **PATTERN**: Related patterns\n\nExample (TypeScript):\n```typescript\n/**\n * USE: When building a type-safe HTTP client for API communication\n * REQUIRES: TypeScript 4.5+\n * PATTERN: Error Handling, Configuration\n */\n```\n\n### AI Template Generation Protocol\n\nThe generation protocol ensures consistent AI-optimized content during setup. When running `/conductor:setup`:\n\n1. Styleguides are copied with AI Quick Reference sections intact\n2. Each copied file is verified for AI-enhanced content\n3. Announcements confirm AI sections are present\n\nSee `protocols/ai-template-generation.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n\n## Technology Intelligence\n\nConductor includes intelligent technology detection and skill activation capabilities that enhance the development experience.\n\n### Automatic Stack Detection\n\nFor brownfield (existing) projects, Conductor automatically detects your technology stack during setup:\n\n- **Primary Language**: Based on manifest files and file extensions\n- **Frameworks**: From dependency analysis (React, Express, Django, FastAPI, etc.)\n- **Build Tools**: Package managers and build systems\n- **Testing Frameworks**: Detected from dev dependencies\n\nDetection confidence levels:\n- **HIGH**: Manifest files with matching dependencies found (score >= 85)\n- **MEDIUM**: Partial matches detected (score 60-84)\n- **LOW**: Limited signals available (score 30-59)\n- **UNCERTAIN**: Minimal signals, manual specification recommended (score < 30)\n\n#### Example Detection Output\n\n```\n🔍 **Stack Detection Results** (Confidence: HIGH)\nStack detection is highly confident in these results.\n\n**Primary Language:** TypeScript\n**Languages Detected:** TypeScript, JavaScript\n**Frameworks:** React (Frontend), Express.js (Backend)\n**Build Tools:** npm, Vite\n**Testing:** Vitest, Playwright\n**Package Manager:** npm\n```\n\nAfter detection, you can:\n- **Accept** the detected values\n- **Edit** specific categories\n- **Skip** and enter manually\n\n### Codebase Pattern Analysis (Brownfield)\n\nFor brownfield projects, Conductor analyzes your existing codebase to detect established patterns and conventions. This analysis generates Progressive Disclosure documentation that helps AI assistants understand and follow your project's practices.\n\n#### Analyzed Categories\n\n| Category | What's Detected |\n|:---------|:----------------|\n| **Code Conventions** | File naming, import patterns, module organization, barrel exports |\n| **Architecture** | Design patterns, layer organization, dependency injection, state management |\n| **Testing** | Test framework, naming conventions, mocking patterns, test organization |\n| **API Patterns** | REST conventions, response formats, error handling, versioning |\n| **Configuration** | Config files, environment variables, build tools, CI/CD |\n| **Annotations** | Custom decorators, documentation patterns, validation decorators |\n\n#### Confidence Levels\n\nEach detected category includes a confidence level:\n- **HIGH (80-100)**: Multiple strong indicators, consistent patterns\n- **MEDIUM (50-79)**: Some indicators found, minor inconsistencies\n- **LOW (20-49)**: Few indicators, patterns unclear\n- **UNCERTAIN (<20)**: Insufficient data for reliable detection\n\n#### Generated Documentation\n\nAfter analysis, you review and approve which categories to include. Approved categories generate:\n\n1. **Codebase Patterns section** in `conductor/product-guidelines.md`:\n   - Quick reference rules (5-10 key patterns)\n   - Directory structure overview\n   - Links to detailed documentation\n\n2. **conductor/docs/** with category-specific files:\n   - `code-conventions.md` - Naming, imports, organization\n   - `architecture.md` - Patterns, layers, DI\n   - `testing.md` - Framework, mocking, organization\n   - `api-patterns.md` - REST, errors, responses\n   - `configuration.md` - Config, env vars, CI/CD\n   - `annotations.md` - Decorators, docs\n\nEach file includes actual code examples from your codebase and confidence indicators.\n\n### Skill Activation System\n\nSkills provide context-aware guidance during implementation. They're automatically activated based on your task context:\n\n- **Always-Active Skills**: Core methodology loaded for every task (e.g., conductor-methodology)\n- **Context-Activated Skills**: Matched based on task keywords, tech stack, and file patterns\n\n#### Activation Scoring\n\nSkills are scored based on multiple factors:\n\n| Match Type | Score |\n|:-----------|:------|\n| Keyword match | +1.0 |\n| File pattern match | +1.5 |\n| Language match | +2.0 |\n| Framework match | +1.5 |\n| Tool match | +1.0 |\n\nSkills with a score >= 1.5 are activated (maximum 5 per task, plus always-active).\n\n#### Skill Announcement\n\nWhen running `/conductor:implement`, activated skills are announced:\n\n```\n🔧 **Skills Activated for This Track:**\n\n**Always Active:**\n- conductor-methodology: Core development workflow guidance\n\n**Context-Activated:** (based on track/task matching)\n- React Best Practices (score: 3.5): Component patterns, hooks usage, state management\n```\n\n### Creating Custom Skills\n\nSee [docs/skill-development.md](docs/skill-development.md) for a comprehensive guide on creating custom skills. Each skill includes:\n\n- **manifest.json**: Metadata and activation rules\n- **SKILL.md**: Guidance content for the AI agent\n- **patterns/** (optional): Skill-specific pattern files\n- **README.md** (optional): External documentation\n\n## Skill Ecosystem\n\nConductor includes a rich skill ecosystem with reference skills and a management command for exploring and configuring skills.\n\n### Managing Skills\n\nUse the skills command to explore and configure skills:\n\n```bash\n# List all available skills\n/conductor:skills list\n\n# View detailed information about a skill\n/conductor:skills info typescript-best-practices\n\n# Disable a skill for the current project\n/conductor:skills disable api-design\n\n# Re-enable a skill\n/conductor:skills enable api-design\n```\n\n### Reference Skills\n\nConductor includes the following reference skills out of the box:\n\n| Skill | Description | Activation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **typescript-best-practices** | Type safety, async patterns, null handling | `.ts`, `.tsx` files; TypeScript tech stack |\n| **api-design** | REST conventions, error responses, versioning | routes/controllers/api directories; backend frameworks |\n| **testing-strategies** | Unit testing, integration testing, mocking | test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`); test frameworks |\n| **acli-jira** | ACLI Jira command reference for work items, projects, boards, sprints | Jira-related keywords; ACLI/Atlassian CLI tools |\n\n### Skill Patterns\n\nEach reference skill includes domain-specific patterns:\n\n**typescript-best-practices:**\n- `type-safety.md` - Type definitions, generics, discriminated unions\n- `async-patterns.md` - Async/await, Promise handling, error management\n- `null-handling.md` - Optional chaining, nullish coalescing, type guards\n\n**api-design:**\n- `rest-conventions.md` - URL naming, HTTP methods, resource design\n- `error-responses.md` - Error format, status codes, error classes\n- `versioning.md` - URL versioning, deprecation, migration\n\n**testing-strategies:**\n- `unit-test-patterns.md` - Structure, naming, assertions\n- `integration-patterns.md` - Database, API, service tests\n- `mocking-strategies.md` - When and how to mock\n\n### Project-Level Skill Configuration\n\nSkills can be enabled/disabled per-project via `conductor/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"disabledSkills\": [\"./api-design\"]\n}\n```\n\nNote: Always-active skills (like conductor-methodology) cannot be disabled.\n\n## Quality Intelligence\n\nConductor includes intelligent quality gates that automatically analyze code for common anti-patterns and provide actionable coverage suggestions during implementation.\n\n### Anti-Pattern Detection\n\nWhen you run `/conductor:implement`, Conductor automatically scans modified files for code quality issues. Anti-patterns are categorized by severity:\n\n| Severity | Behavior | Examples |\n|:---------|:---------|:---------|\n| **Critical** | Blocks task completion | Security vulnerabilities |\n| **High** | Warns, requires documented skip | God Object, Mutable Defaults, Spaghetti Code |\n| **Medium** | Informational | Magic Numbers, Deep Nesting |\n\n#### Example Quality Gate Output\n\n```\n⚠️ **Quality Gate: Issues Detected**\n\n| Severity | File | Line | Anti-Pattern | Issue |\n|----------|------|------|--------------|-------|\n| 🔴 High | src/service.py | 45 | Mutable Defaults | `def process(items=[])` |\n| 🟡 Medium | src/utils.py | 23 | Magic Numbers | Literal `86400` |\n\nOptions: (1) Fix issues (2) Skip with reason (3) View guidance\n```\n\n#### Core Anti-Patterns\n\nThe following anti-patterns are detected out of the box:\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Severity | Detection |\n|:-------------|:---------|:----------|\n| God Object | High | Classes >500 lines or >20 methods |\n| Mutable Defaults | High | `def f(x=[])` or `def f(x={})` patterns |\n| Spaghetti Code | High | Cyclomatic complexity >15 |\n| Magic Numbers | Medium | Unexplained numeric literals |\n| Deep Nesting | Medium | Nesting depth >4 levels |\n\n### Coverage Intelligence\n\nWhen a coverage report is available, Conductor analyzes it to suggest prioritized tests based on business impact:\n\n```\n### Coverage Intelligence\n\n**Current Coverage:** 75% (Target: 80%)\n\n**Top Suggestions:**\n1. `process_payment()` in services/payment.py (+2.5% gain)\n   - Core business logic, currently untested\n2. `validate_input()` in api/handlers.py (+1.8% gain)\n   - Input validation with multiple branches\n```\n\n#### Supported Coverage Formats\n\n- **LCOV**: `lcov.info`, `coverage.lcov`\n- **Cobertura XML**: `coverage.xml`, `cobertura.xml`\n- **Istanbul JSON**: `coverage-final.json`\n- **Coverage.py**: `.coverage`, `coverage.json`\n- **Go Cover**: `coverage.out`\n\n### Skip Documentation\n\nWhen skipping quality gate warnings, document your reasoning:\n\n```markdown\n### Quality Gate Decisions\n\n**Skipped Anti-Patterns:**\n- **Mutable Defaults** at src/service.py:45\n  - Reason: Intentional memoization cache, documented in function docstring\n  - Reviewed: 2026-01-20\n```\n\n### Adding Custom Anti-Patterns\n\nCreate new anti-patterns in `patterns/anti-patterns/core/` using the template at `patterns/anti-patterns/TEMPLATE.md`. Each anti-pattern includes:\n\n- **YAML Frontmatter**: Severity, detection patterns, file extensions\n- **AI Quick Reference**: Concise detection and fix guidance\n- **Human Documentation**: Detailed explanations with examples\n- **Exceptions**: Valid use cases where the pattern is acceptable\n\n## Decision Logging\n\nConductor captures the \"why\" alongside the \"what\" through Architecture Decision Record (ADR) logging. When significant decisions are made during implementation, they're automatically documented in a track-specific `decisions.md` file.\n\n### How It Works\n\nDuring `/conductor:implement`, when Conductor detects a significant decision point (technology selection, pattern choice, API design, etc.), it prompts you with options:\n\n```\n---\n**Decision Point: Library Selection**\n\n**Context:** We need to implement HTTP client functionality for API calls.\n\n**Options:**\nA. **axios** (Recommended)\n   Popular HTTP client with interceptors and automatic transforms\n   - Pros: Wide adoption, good TypeScript support\n   - Cons: Additional dependency\n\nB. **Native fetch**\n   Built-in browser/Node.js API\n   - Pros: No dependencies\n   - Cons: More boilerplate, no interceptors\n\nSelect an option (A/B/skip):\n---\n```\n\n### ADR Format\n\nDecisions are recorded in the standard ADR format:\n\n```markdown\n### ADR-001: Use axios for HTTP client\n\n**Date:** 2026-01-20\n**Status:** Accepted\n\n#### Context\nThe feature requires making API calls to external services. We need a\nreliable HTTP client that supports interceptors for authentication headers.\n\n#### Decision\nWe will use axios as the HTTP client library.\n\n#### Consequences\n**Positive:**\n- Consistent error handling across the application\n- Built-in request/response interceptors for auth\n\n**Negative:**\n- Additional 15KB dependency\n- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with axios\n\n#### Alternatives Considered\n- **Native fetch:** Rejected due to lack of built-in interceptors\n```\n\n### Generated Artifacts\n\nEach track includes a decisions log:\n- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/decisions.md` - Track-specific decision log\n\n### When Decisions Are Captured\n\nDecisions are prompted for significant choices that:\n- Involve tradeoffs between alternatives\n- Have long-term architectural implications\n- Deviate from established patterns\n- Would benefit future maintainers\n\nTrivial choices (dictated by spec, single option, easily reversible) are skipped automatically.\n\n### Browsing Decisions\n\nView a track's decisions by reading its `decisions.md` file or through the track index:\n\n```bash\ncat conductor/tracks/<track_id>/decisions.md\n```\n\n## Universal File Resolution Protocol (UFRP)\n\nConductor uses a flexible file resolution system that allows you to customize your project structure while maintaining compatibility. The system works through `index.md` files that act as navigation indexes:\n\n- **Project Index**: `conductor/index.md` - Links to all project-level documents\n- **Track Index**: `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/index.md` - Links to track-specific documents\n\nCommands automatically resolve file paths using these index files with fallback to standard default paths. This means you can reorganize your conductor directory structure by updating the index files, and all commands will continue to work correctly.\n\nFor more details, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).\n\n## Development\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.12+\n- Git\n\n### Setup Development Environment\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-conductor.git\ncd claude-conductor\n\n# Create a virtual environment\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install development dependencies\npip install -r scripts/requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npytest scripts/tests/ -v\n\n# Run with coverage\npytest scripts/tests/ --cov=scripts --cov-report=html\n\n# Run specific test file\npytest scripts/tests/test_commands.py -v\n\n# Run specific test class\npytest scripts/tests/test_commands.py::TestSkillsCommand -v\n```\n\n### Code Quality Checks\n\n```bash\n# Run linting\npylint scripts/\n\n# Check code formatting\nblack --check scripts/\n\n# Run type checking\nmypy scripts/\n\n# Security scan\npip-audit\n```\n\n## Attribution\n\n**Claude Conductor for Claude Code** is a derivative work based on the [Conductor Extension for Gemini CLI](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor), originally released under the Apache License 2.0.\n\nThe original Conductor project provided the foundational context-driven development methodology.
