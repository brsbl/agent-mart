        "README.md": "# My Little Scrum Team\n\nA Claude Code plugin providing a collection of AI agents and skills that work together as a coordinated scrum team.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From Plugin Marketplace\n\n```\n/plugin install my-little-scrum-team\n```\n\n### From GitHub\n\n```\n/plugin install https://github.com/lexicalninja/my-little-scrum-team\n```\n\n### Local Development\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./path-to-this-repo\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin provides a complete development team of AI agents to help build things together.\n\n## Agent Workflows\n\nAgents work together in a coordinated workflow:\n- **Manager** → Makes strategic decisions, hires agents, manages resources, and ensures projects have the right agents before work begins\n- **Orchestrator** → Orchestrates the full development workflow from idea to implementation\n- **Specification Writer** → Creates detailed specifications\n- **Scrum Master** → Breaks specifications into atomic tasks (including Design, Implementation, Infrastructure, Deployment)\n- **UI/UX Designer** → Picks up Design tasks and adds design specifications\n- **Implementation Engineer** → Implements tasks, submits for review, iterates until approved, then commits\n- **Infrastructure Engineer** → Handles Infrastructure and Deployment tasks\n- **Code Reviewer Feedback** → Reviews code and provides structured feedback\n\nEach agent's documentation explains how it discovers and processes tasks.\n- Task discovery and processing\n- Design task integration\n\n## What are Claude Code Agents?\n\nClaude Code agents are specialized AI assistants that Claude can delegate tasks to. Each agent operates in its own context window, handles specific types of work, and returns its result to the parent agent. Use agents to break down complex tasks, do work in parallel, and preserve context in the main conversation.\n\nLearn more: [Claude Code Plugins Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)\n\n## Available Agents\n\nAll agents are located in `agents/` and can be invoked explicitly or used automatically by Claude.\n\n### 👔 Manager\n**File:** `agents/manager.md`\n\nMakes strategic decisions on work, hires agents (creates new or selects existing), and ensures projects have the right agents before work begins. Works alongside orchestrator to manage resources, prioritize tasks, handle escalations, resolve conflicts, and manage quality gates.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:manager review tasks and hire necessary agents\n/my-little-scrum-team:manager prioritize these tasks\n/my-little-scrum-team:manager resolve this conflict between agents\n```\n\n### 🎯 Orchestrator\n**File:** `agents/orchestrator.md`\n\nOrchestrates the full development workflow from idea to implementation. Automatically coordinates all agents in the correct sequence: specification → tasks → design → implementation → review → commit.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:orchestrator build a user login page with email and password\n/my-little-scrum-team:orchestrator implement the features in specification-user-dashboard.md\n```\n\nThis is the recommended way to build features end-to-end automatically.\n\n### 📋 Specification Writer\n**File:** `agents/specification-writer.md`\n\nTransforms ideas into detailed specifications and implementation directions. Takes high-level concepts and breaks them down into actionable specifications for another agent to implement.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:specification-writer turn this idea into a detailed spec: \"build a user dashboard\"\n```\n\n### 📊 Scrum Master\n**File:** `agents/scrum-master.md`\n\nReviews specification documents and breaks them down into atomic, modular tasks. Creates task lists with dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and build-safe implementation strategies.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:scrum-master break down this specification into tasks: [specification document]\n```\n\n### 🎨 UI/UX Designer\n**File:** `agents/ui-ux-designer.md`\n\nAccepts design-focused tasks and adds comprehensive design specifications. Creates markdown design specs, considers accessibility and responsive design, and updates task documents using a hybrid approach (sections for simple tasks, separate tasks for complex).\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:ui-ux-designer add design specs to this task: [task document]\n```\n\n### 👷 Implementation Engineer\n**File:** `agents/implementation-engineer.md`\n\nImplements tasks from scrum-master, submits to code-reviewer-feedback, responds to feedback iteratively until approved, then commits changes. Handles both frontend and backend implementation work.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:implementation-engineer implement TASK-010 from tasks-dog-webpage.md\n```\n\n### 🏗️ Infrastructure Engineer\n**File:** `agents/infrastructure-engineer.md`\n\nSets up infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment configurations, and development environments. Handles infrastructure-as-code, automation, and deployment readiness.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:infrastructure-engineer set up CI/CD pipeline for this project\n```\n\n### 🔍 Code Reviewer Feedback\n**File:** `agents/code-reviewer-feedback.md`\n\nReviews code and provides structured feedback documents for coding agents. Creates actionable feedback with file paths, line numbers, code examples, and prioritization. Automatically triggers on commits to main, branch merges, or pull requests.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:code-reviewer-feedback review the latest changes\n```\n\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Automatic Orchestration (Recommended)\n\nUse the orchestrator to automatically run the full workflow from idea to implementation:\n\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:orchestrator build a user login page with email and password\n```\n\nThe orchestrator will automatically:\n1. Create specification (specification-writer)\n2. Break into tasks (scrum-master)\n3. Manager reviews and hires necessary agents (manager)\n4. Add design specs (ui-ux-designer)\n5. Implement code (implementation-engineer)\n6. Review and iterate (code-reviewer-feedback)\n7. Commit changes\n\n**Note:** The manager works alongside the orchestrator to make strategic decisions, hire agents when needed, and manage resources throughout the workflow.\n\n### Explicit Invocation\n\nUse the `/my-little-scrum-team:agent-name` syntax to invoke a specific agent:\n\n```\n/my-little-scrum-team:implementation-engineer implement the login form\n/my-little-scrum-team:code-reviewer-feedback review the authentication code\n/my-little-scrum-team:infrastructure-engineer set up the deployment pipeline\n```\n\n### Natural Language\n\nYou can also invoke agents naturally:\n\n```\nUse the orchestrator agent to build a user dashboard\nHave the code reviewer agent review the latest changes\nRun the infrastructure engineer agent on the deployment setup\n```\n\n### Automatic Delegation\n\nClaude Code will automatically use these agents when appropriate based on their descriptions. The agent reads the `description` field in each agent's YAML frontmatter to decide when to delegate.\n\n## Creating Custom Agents\n\nTo create a new agent, add a markdown file to `agents/` with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: my-agent\ndescription: When to use this agent. Be specific!\nmodel: inherit\n---\n\nYour agent instructions here...\n```\n\n### Configuration Fields\n\n- `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase with hyphens)\n- `description`: When to use this agent (Claude reads this for delegation)\n- `model`: `fast`, `inherit`, or specific model ID (defaults to `inherit`)\n- `readonly`: If `true`, restricts write permissions\n- `is_background`: If `true`, runs in background without waiting\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Write focused agents** — Each agent should have a single, clear responsibility\n- **Invest in descriptions** — The `description` field determines when Claude delegates\n- **Keep prompts concise** — Be specific and direct\n- **Add to version control** — Check `agents/` into your repository\n\n## Available Skills (Claude-Style)\n\nSkills are reusable, single-purpose capabilities that follow Claude's Skills format.
