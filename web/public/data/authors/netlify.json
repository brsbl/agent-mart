        "README.md": "# Netlify Context and Tools\n\nPublic Netlify skills for AI coding agents. Each skill is a focused, factual reference for a Netlify platform primitive — designed to help agents build correctly on Netlify without needing to search docs.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | What it covers |\n|---|---|\n| [netlify-functions](skills/netlify-functions/SKILL.md) | Serverless functions — modern syntax, routing, background/scheduled/streaming |\n| [netlify-edge-functions](skills/netlify-edge-functions/SKILL.md) | Edge compute — Deno runtime, middleware, geolocation |\n| [netlify-blobs](skills/netlify-blobs/SKILL.md) | Object storage — key-value and binary data |\n| [netlify-db](skills/netlify-db/SKILL.md) | Managed Postgres (Neon) with Drizzle ORM and migrations |\n| [netlify-image-cdn](skills/netlify-image-cdn/SKILL.md) | Image transformation and optimization via CDN |\n| [netlify-forms](skills/netlify-forms/SKILL.md) | HTML form handling, AJAX submissions, spam filtering |\n| [netlify-config](skills/netlify-config/SKILL.md) | `netlify.toml` — redirects, headers, build settings, deploy contexts |\n| [netlify-cli-and-deploy](skills/netlify-cli-and-deploy/SKILL.md) | CLI commands, Git vs manual deploys, environment variables |\n| [netlify-frameworks](skills/netlify-frameworks/SKILL.md) | Framework adapters for Vite, Astro, TanStack, and Next.js |\n| [netlify-caching](skills/netlify-caching/SKILL.md) | CDN cache control, cache tags, purge, stale-while-revalidate |\n| [netlify-ai-gateway](skills/netlify-ai-gateway/SKILL.md) | AI Gateway proxy for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google SDKs |\n| [netlify-deploy](skills/netlify-deploy/SKILL.md) | Deployment workflow — auth, site linking, preview/production deploys |\n\n### References\n\nSome skills include `references/` subdirectories with deeper content:\n\n- [User-uploaded images pipeline](skills/netlify-image-cdn/references/user-uploads.md) — composing Functions + Blobs + Image CDN\n- [Vite on Netlify](skills/netlify-frameworks/references/vite.md)\n- [Astro on Netlify](skills/netlify-frameworks/references/astro.md)\n- [TanStack Start on Netlify](skills/netlify-frameworks/references/tanstack.md)\n- [Next.js on Netlify](skills/netlify-frameworks/references/nextjs.md)\n- [CLI commands reference](skills/netlify-deploy/references/cli-commands.md)\n- [Deployment patterns](skills/netlify-deploy/references/deployment-patterns.md)\n- [netlify.toml guide](skills/netlify-deploy/references/netlify-toml.md)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nAdd the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add netlify/context-and-tools\n/plugin install netlify-skills@netlify-context-and-tools\n```\n\nThis installs all Netlify skills into Claude Code. The included `skills/CLAUDE.md` acts as a router — it tells the agent which skill to read based on what you're building.\n\n### Cursor\n\nInstall from the [Cursor plugin marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace):\n\n1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)\n2. Go to **Plugins**\n3. Search for **netlify-skills**\n4. Click **Install**\n\nOr install via the command palette: `Cmd+Shift+P` → **Plugins: Install Plugin** → search **netlify-skills**.\n\nThis installs 21 `.mdc` rule files covering all Netlify platform primitives. A router rule (`netlify-skills-router.mdc`) is always active and directs the agent to the right skill for the task.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Manual installation (without the plugin marketplace)</summary>\n\nCopy pre-built rule files directly into your project:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/netlify/context-and-tools.git /tmp/netlify-skills && \\\n  mkdir -p .cursor/rules && \\\n  cp /tmp/netlify-skills/cursor/rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/ && \\\n  rm -rf /tmp/netlify-skills\n```\n\nThis copies `.mdc` rule files into `.cursor/rules/`, where Cursor automatically discovers them.\n\n</details>\n\n### Codex\n\nCopy the pre-built `codex/` directory into your project root:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/netlify/context-and-tools.git /tmp/netlify-skills && \\\n  cp -r /tmp/netlify-skills/codex . && \\\n  rm -rf /tmp/netlify-skills\n```\n\nThis gives you `codex/AGENTS.md` (the skill router) and `codex/skills/` with all Netlify skills. Codex discovers `AGENTS.md` automatically and activates skills by name using `$skill-name` syntax.\n\n### Other AI agents\n\nEach `SKILL.md` file is a self-contained reference with YAML frontmatter (`name` and `description`) and markdown body. Feed them into any agent's context as needed.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- **Factual, not opinionated** — platform behavior and API reference, not workflow preferences\n- **Composable** — skills cover individual primitives; agents combine them as needed\n- **Concise** — each SKILL.md stays under 500 lines; detailed content goes in `references/`\n- **Current** — covers modern Netlify patterns (v2 functions, Vite plugin, AI Gateway)\n\n## Contributing\n\nKeep skills focused on Netlify platform primitives. Each skill should answer \"how does this Netlify feature work?\" rather than \"how should I structure my project?\"\n\nFollow the existing format: YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, markdown body, code examples with TypeScript where applicable. Use `references/` subdirectories for content that would push a SKILL.md past 500 lines.\n\n### Cursor rules and Codex skills are generated — do not edit them directly\n\nThe `cursor/rules/` and `codex/` directories are auto-generated from `skills/` by GitHub Actions workflows. Always edit the source files in `skills/` — the workflows rebuild on every push to `main` that changes `skills/`. To test locally:\n\n```bash\nbash scripts/build-cursor-rules.sh\nbash scripts/build-codex-skills.sh\n```\n"
