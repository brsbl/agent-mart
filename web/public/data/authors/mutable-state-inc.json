        "README.md": "# Ensue Memory Network\n\n**Get smarter alongside your AI.**\n\nYour intelligence shouldn't reset every conversation. Ensue is a persistent knowledge tree that grows with you - what you learn today enriches tomorrow's reasoning.\n\n## The Idea\n\nEvery conversation with an LLM starts from zero. You explain context, re-establish preferences, repeat decisions you've already made. Your knowledge doesn't compound.\n\nEnsue changes that:\n\n- **Your knowledge persists** - Build a tree of intelligence that spans conversations\n- **Context carries forward** - Prior research, decisions, and insights inform new work\n- **You get smarter together** - The LLM learns your thinking patterns, not just facts\n\nThink of it as extended memory. When you ask about GPU inference, the LLM checks what you already know. When you make an architecture decision, it connects to past decisions in similar domains. Your accumulated knowledge becomes part of every conversation.\n\n## Install (Claude Code)\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/ensue-skill\n```\n\n```\n/plugin install ensue-memory\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code. The skill will guide you through setup.\n\n## Configuration\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `ENSUE_API_KEY` | Required. Get one at [dashboard](https://www.ensue-network.ai/dashboard) |\n| `ENSUE_READONLY` | Set to `true` to disable auto-logging (session tracking, tool capture). Manual `remember`/`recall` still works. |\n\n```bash\n# Disable auto-logging for a session\nENSUE_READONLY=true claude\n\n# Or add to ~/.zshrc for permanent read-only mode\nexport ENSUE_READONLY=true\n```\n\n## Try it\n\n```\n\"remember my preferred stack is React + Postgres\"\n\"what do I know about caching strategies?\"\n\"check my research/distributed-systems/ notes\"\n```\n\n## Links\n\n[Docs](https://www.ensue-network.ai/docs) · [Dashboard](https://www.ensue-network.ai/dashboard) · [Homepage](https://ensue.dev) · API: `https://api.ensue-network.ai`\n\n## Research Agent\n\nBuild structured knowledge trees that persist across sessions.\n\n```\n\"research GPU inference optimization for my ML server\"\n\"learn about distributed systems\"\n\"help me understand Kubernetes deeply\"\n```\n\nThe research agent autonomously explores topics, maps concepts and their relationships, identifies knowledge gaps, and writes everything to your Ensue memory. What you learn today compounds into tomorrow's reasoning.\n\n![Research Tree](assets/research-tree.png)\n"
