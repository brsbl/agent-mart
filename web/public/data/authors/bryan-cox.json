It helps you maintain a structured log of your daily tasks, calculate hours worked, and generate progress reports in both human-readable text and formatted HTML.\n\n## Disclaimer: AI-Assisted Development\n\nThis project heavily utilizes artificial intelligence for code generation. While AI has been a powerful tool in the development process, it's important to understand the following:\n\n* **No Guarantees:** The code is provided on an \"as-is\" basis. There is no guarantee that it is free of bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.\n* **Use with Caution:** You are solely responsible for any outcomes that result from using this code. Always review and test the code thoroughly before implementing it in a production environment.\n* **AI Is Not Perfect:** The AI may have generated code that is suboptimal or contains inaccuracies.\n\nBy using the code in this repository, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. \n\n## Features\n\n* Log daily work entries, including tasks, status, and blockers.\n* Calculate total hours worked for any given day or date range.\n* Generate human-readable reports with emoji sections:\n    * 🦀 **Thing I've been working on** - Completed tasks grouped by Jira ticket\n    * :starfleet: **Thing I plan on working on next** - In-progress tasks without blockers\n    * :facepalm: **Thing that is blocking me** - Tasks with blockers that need attention\n* **JIRA Integration:**\n    * Automatic conversion of JIRA ticket references to clickable links\n    * Fetch and display JIRA ticket summaries (when `JIRA_PAT` is configured)\n    * Support for both ticket IDs and full JIRA URLs\n* **HTML Output Options:**\n    * Export reports as formatted HTML files\n    * Automatically open HTML reports in default browser\n    * Copy HTML to system clipboard (when clipboard tools are available)\n    * Display HTML source in terminal\n* Support for GitHub PR tracking and upnext descriptions\n* Simple and extensible command structure powered by Cobra\n* Structured logging with `slog` for easy integration with other tools\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/taskledger.git](https://github.com/your-username/taskledger.git)\n    cd taskledger\n    ```\n\n2.  **Initialize Go Module (if not already done):**\n    ```bash\n    go mod init [github.com/your-username/taskledger](https://github.com/your-username/taskledger)\n    go mod tidy\n    ```\n\n3.  **Build the binary:**\n    Use the provided `Makefile` to build the application.\n    ```bash\n    make build\n    ```\n    This will create an executable at `./bin/taskledger`.\n\n## The `worklog.yml` File\n\nTaskLedger reads from a `worklog.yml` file in the project root by default. You can create this file and structure it as follows:\n\n```yaml\n# A log of work, organized by date.\n# Each date is a top-level key in \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format.\n\"2024-07-26\":\n  work_log:\n    - start_time: \"09:05\"\n      end_time: \"12:15\"\n    - start_time: \"13:00\"\n      end_time: \"17:30\"\n  tasks:\n    - jira_ticket: \"PROJ-1234\"\n      description: \"Implemented a new OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for user login. This included front-end and back-end changes.\"\n      status: \"completed\" # Can be: not started, in progress, completed\n      qc_goal: \"Q1-2024-Strategic-5\" # Optional: for tracking quarterly goals\n      github_pr: \"https://github.com/example/repo/pull/123\"\n      upnext_description: \"\"\n      blocker: \"\" # Leave empty if not blocked\n\n    # Alternative: Use descriptions array for multiple updates on same ticket\n    - jira_ticket: \"PROJ-2000\"\n      descriptions:\n        - \"Morning: Reviewed architecture and identified performance issues\"\n        - \"Afternoon: Implemented caching layer for database queries\"\n        - \"Evening: Verified 40% improvement in response times\"\n      status: \"completed\"\n      github_pr: \"https://github.com/example/repo/pull/456\"\n      upnext_description: \"\"\n      blocker: \"\"\n\n\"2024-07-27\":\n  work_log:\n    - start_time: \"09:00\"\n      end_time: \"17:00\"\n  tasks:\n    - jira_ticket: \"PROJ-5678\"\n      description: \"Investigating a bug where the quarterly report fails to generate for large datasets. The issue seems to be a memory leak.\"\n      status: \"in progress\"\n      github_pr: \"\"\n      upnext_description: \"Continue debugging the memory leak issue\"\n      blocker: \"Waiting for access to the production database logs to replicate the issue.\"\n```\n\n## JIRA Integration\n\nTaskLedger can automatically convert JIRA ticket references into clickable links and fetch ticket summaries from the Red Hat JIRA instance.\n\n## Slack Integration\n\nTaskLedger's HTML output is specifically optimized for Slack compatibility:\n\n* **Nested List Structure**: HTML reports use proper `<ul>` and `<li>` tags that Slack interprets correctly\n* **Simple Formatting**: Removes complex CSS that Slack doesn't support  \n* **Copy/Paste Friendly**: HTML can be copied directly from browser and pasted into Slack with preserved formatting\n* **Maintains Hierarchy**: JIRA tickets appear as main bullets with task details as sub-bullets\n\n**Usage for Slack**: Generate an HTML report, open it in your browser with `--open-html`, then copy the content and paste directly into Slack for properly formatted status updates.\n\n### Configuration\n\nTo enable JIRA ticket summary fetching, set the `JIRA_PAT` environment variable with your Personal Access Token:\n\n```bash\nexport JIRA_PAT=\"your_personal_access_token_here\"\n```\n\n### Getting a JIRA Personal Access Token\n\n1. Log into [Red Hat JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/)\n2. Go to your **Account Settings** → **Security** → **Create and manage API tokens**\n3. Click **Create API token**\n4. Give it a name (e.g., \"TaskLedger CLI\")\n5. Copy the generated token and set it as the `JIRA_PAT` environment variable\n\n### JIRA Integration Features\n\n* **Without `JIRA_PAT`:** JIRA references become clickable links (e.g., `CNTRLPLANE-123` → link to ticket)\n* **With `JIRA_PAT`:** Links include ticket summaries (e.g., `CNTRLPLANE-123: FBC Integration`)\n* **Supported formats:**\n  - Ticket IDs: `PROJ-123`, `CNTRLPLANE-456`\n  - Full URLs: `https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJ-123`\n* **Error handling:** If API calls fail, falls back to basic links with warning logs\n\n### Example YAML with JIRA Integration\n\n```yaml\n\"2024-07-26\":\n  tasks:\n    - jira_ticket: \"CNTRLPLANE-123\"  # Will become a clickable link\n      description: \"Implemented FBC integration\"\n      status: \"completed\"\n    - jira_ticket: \"https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJ-456\"  # Also works with full URLs\n      description: \"Bug investigation\"\n      status: \"in progress\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere are some examples of how to run the CLI tool from your terminal.\n\n### Calculating Hours\n\n* **Calculate hours for a single day:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger hours --start-date=2024-07-26\n    ```\n\n* **Calculate total hours over a date range:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger hours --start-date=2024-07-26 --end-date=2024-07-27\n    ```\n\n* **Calculate total hours for all entries in the log:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger hours\n    ```\n\n### Generating Reports\n\n* **Generate a report for a single day:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --start-date=2024-07-27\n    ```\n\n* **Generate a report for a date range:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --start-date=2024-07-26 --end-date=2024-07-27\n    ```\n\n* **Generate a report for all entries in the log:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report\n    ```\n\n### HTML Output Options\n\nTaskLedger can generate beautifully formatted HTML reports with clickable JIRA links and styled sections.\n\n* **Save report as HTML file:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --html-file report.html\n    ```\n\n* **Save and automatically open HTML file in browser:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --html-file report.html --open-html\n    ```\n\n* **Copy HTML report to clipboard (when clipboard tools available):**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --copy-html\n    ```\n\n* **Display HTML source in terminal:**\n    ```bash\n    ./bin/taskledger report --show-html\n    ```\n\n* **Combine options:**\n    ```bash\n    # Generate HTML report with JIRA summaries, save to file, and auto-open\n    export JIRA_PAT=\"your_token\"\n    ./bin/taskledger report --html-file weekly-report.html --open-html --start-date=2024-07-26 --end-date=2024-07-27\n    \n    # Generate HTML and both save to file and copy to clipboard\n    ./bin/taskledger report --html-file report.html --copy-html --open-html\n    ```\n\n**HTML Features:**\n- Clean, modern styling with proper typography\n- Clickable JIRA ticket links (with summaries when `JIRA_PAT` is configured)\n- Clickable GitHub PR links\n- Responsive design that works in browsers and email clients\n- Professional formatting suitable for sharing with stakeholders\n- Cross-platform auto-open support (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n- Slack-compatible nested list structure for easy copy/paste\n\n### Sample Report Output\n\n```\nWork Report (2024-07-26 to 2024-07-27)\n========================================\n=======Autogenerated by TaskLedger=======\n\n🦀 Thing I've been working on\n    • PROJ-1234: \n        • Implemented a new OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for user login.

This is crucial for proper status tracking and report generation.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Every task should have a unique `jira_ticket` identifier** - even for non-Jira work\n2. **Tasks are grouped by `jira_ticket`** - multiple entries with the same identifier are treated as updates to the same work item\n3. **Status progression is tracked chronologically** - the most recent task entry for each `jira_ticket` determines current status\n4. **Completed tasks disappear from \"next up\"** - when the latest entry for a `jira_ticket` is marked \"completed\", it won't appear in future planning sections\n\n### Examples of Good `jira_ticket` Values:\n\n```yaml\n# Official Jira tickets\njira_ticket: \"PROJ-1234\"\njira_ticket: \"https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-1234\"\n\n# Custom identifiers for non-Jira work\njira_ticket: \"NO-JIRA: Update Documentation\"\njira_ticket: \"ADMIN-001: Setup New Environment\" \njira_ticket: \"BUG-FIX: Login Page CSS Issue\"\njira_ticket: \"RESEARCH: Evaluate New Framework\"\n```\n\n### What Happens Without Unique Identifiers:\n\nIf you leave `jira_ticket` empty or use the same value for unrelated tasks, TaskLedger cannot properly track task progression, and you may see completed work still appearing in \"next up\" sections.\n\n## YAML Fields Reference\n\n### Task Fields\n\n- `jira_ticket`: **Required** - Unique identifier for grouping related tasks (Jira ticket ID, URL, or custom identifier)\n- `description`: Single task description (use this OR descriptions, not both)\n- `descriptions`: Array of multiple descriptions for the same task - useful for tracking multiple updates throughout the day (alternative to description)\n- `status`: Task status - \"completed\", \"in progress\", or \"not started\"\n- `qc_goal`: Quarterly connect goal ID for personal tracking (optional, not displayed in reports)\n- `github_pr`: GitHub pull request URL\n- `upnext_description`: Specific description for next up tasks\n- `blocker`: Description of what's blocking the task (if any)\n\n## Claude Code Plugin\n\nTaskLedger includes a Claude Code plugin that enables automatic JIRA ticket updates directly from your worklog.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the plugin from the Claude Code marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugins add taskledger\n```\n\nOr install directly from the repository:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugins add github:bryan-cox/taskledger\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code CLI installed\n- Atlassian JIRA MCP server configured (provides JIRA API access)\n\n### Commands\n\n#### `/update-jira`\n\nPost work report comments to JIRA tickets from your worklog.yml file.\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be posted (dry run)\n/update-jira --dry-run\n\n# Update tickets for today\n/update-jira\n\n# Update tickets for a specific date range\n/update-jira --start-date 2025-01-06 --end-date 2025-01-07\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Reads tasks from worklog.yml and groups by JIRA ticket\n- Generates formatted comments in Jira wiki markup\n- Checks for duplicate comments to avoid spam\n- Shows preview and asks for confirmation before posting\n- Includes work completed, PRs, next steps, and blockers\n\n**Comment Format:**\n```\nh2. Status Update: 2025-01-06 to 2025-01-07\n\n*Work Completed:*\n* Implemented feature X\n* Fixed bug in Y component\n\n*Pull Requests:*\n* [PR #123|https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123]\n\n*Next Steps:* Complete unit tests and submit for review\n\n----\n_Generated via TaskLedger /update-jira_\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `--start-date YYYY-MM-DD`: Start of date range (defaults to today)\n- `--end-date YYYY-MM-DD`: End of date range (defaults to today)\n- `--dry-run`: Preview mode - shows what would be posted without actually posting\n"
