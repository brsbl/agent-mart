        "README.md": "# d.labs Claude Marketplace\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins by [d.labs](https://dlabs.si).\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Description | Version |\n|--------|-------------|---------|\n| [blueprint-dev](./blueprint-dev) | Planning-first, design-driven development workflow with A/B design variants, architecture robustness checks, trunk-based development enforcement, agent team swarms, compound knowledge accumulation, browser testing, feature video walkthroughs, and git worktree management. | 1.2.0 |\n\n## Installation\n\n**Step 1:** Add the marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/dlabs/claude-marketplace\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Install the plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install blueprint-dev\n```\n\nThis installs with `user` scope by default (available across all projects). To install for a single project only:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install blueprint-dev --scope project\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Restart Claude Code for the plugin to take effect.\n\n## What's Inside blueprint-dev\n\n- **25 specialized agents** — from architecture review to compound knowledge extraction\n- **19 slash commands** — full pipeline from `/discover` to `/compound`, plus browser testing and video walkthroughs\n- **10 skills** — reference knowledge for planning, A/B testing, trunk-based dev, browser automation, git worktrees, and more\n- **1 hook** — automatic stack detection on session start\n\n### Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Detect your stack\n/blueprint-dev:bp:discover\n\n# 2. Plan a feature\n/blueprint-dev:bp:plan \"add user authentication\"\n\n# 3. Or run the full pipeline\n/blueprint-dev:bp:lfg \"add user authentication\"\n\n# 4. Run browser tests on affected pages\n/blueprint-dev:bp:test-browser\n```\n\nSee the full [Blueprint-Dev Guide](./blueprint-dev/GUIDE.md) for detailed usage.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "design-studio/README.md": "# design-studio\n\nCode-first design exploration for Claude Code. Build a brand identity through interactive discovery, generate standalone HTML variants from text descriptions, compare in browser, extract tokens, ship as production Next.js components using your installed component libraries (shadcn/ui, Radix UI).\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin add ./design-studio\n\n/design-studio:ds:design-init\n/design-studio:ds:brand \"SaaS developer tool, clean and technical\"\n# Answer Q&A, review brand guide + showcase pages\n/design-studio:ds:design \"pricing page with 3 tiers\"\n# Open HTML files in browser, compare\n/design-studio:ds:design-pick b\n/design-studio:ds:design-ship\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Brand** (optional) — Build a brand identity through interactive Q&A. Get a style guide and showcase pages that prove the brand works in practice.\n\n**Explore** — Describe what you want. Get 3-4 standalone HTML files that open in any browser. Each explores a different layout, interaction, or hierarchy. Brand tokens and personality guide the output.\n\n**Decide** — Pick the variant you like. Design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) are extracted and locked for consistency across future explorations.\n\n**Ship** — Convert to production Next.js components that follow your project's conventions and use installed component libraries (shadcn/ui, Radix UI). Dry-run first, write after confirmation.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `ds:brand` | Build brand identity through interactive discovery |\n| `ds:design` | Generate HTML variants from a description |\n| `ds:design-pick` | Pick a variant and extract design tokens |\n| `ds:design-ship` | Convert chosen variant to Next.js (uses shadcn/ui when detected) |\n| `ds:design-init` | Set up workspace and gitignore |\n| `ds:design-status` | Show workspace state |\n\n## What's Inside\n\n| Component | Count |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Agents | 5 (brand-builder, brand-showcase-generator, variant-generator, token-extractor, nextjs-converter) |\n| Commands | 6 |\n| Skills | 1 (design-system with 6 references) |\n| Hooks | 1 (SessionStart workspace check) |\n| Scripts | 3 (init-workspace, manage-session, manage-brand) |\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Brand discovery** — build a coherent brand identity through interactive Q&A before designing\n- **Zero build step** — HTML variants use Tailwind CDN, open in any browser\n- **Token persistence** — picked tokens constrain future variants for design consistency\n- **Component library-aware shipping** — converter detects shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and `cn()` to output idiomatic components\n- **Safe by default** — dry-run before writing, never overwrites existing files\n\nSee [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for the complete user guide.\n"
