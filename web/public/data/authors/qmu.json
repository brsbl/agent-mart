        "README.md": "# Workaholic\n\nClaude Code plugin aiming at in-repository ticket-driven development (TiDD). It stores project context in `.workaholic/` for better AI decisions, enabling fast serial development without worktree or multi-repo overhead.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> **This plugin drives git on your behalf.** Workaholic lets Claude Code autonomously create branches, commit, amend, push, and open pull requests. Review the command list below before installing so you know what to expect.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nclaude\n/plugin marketplace add qmu/workaholic\n```\n\nEnable the plugin after installation. Auto update is recommended.\n\n| Command   | What it does                                  |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| `/ticket` | Plan a change with context and steps          |\n| `/drive`  | Implement queued tickets one by one           |\n| `/scan`   | Full documentation scan (all 17 agents)       |\n| `/report` | Generate story and create PR                  |\n\n### Typical Session\n\n```bash\n/ticket add dark mode toggle to settings page\n/ticket support system preference detection\n/drive                            # implement both, confirm each\n/ticket fix flash of light theme on page load\n/drive                            # fix discovered issue\n/report                           # generate story + create PR\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nA ticket is a markdown file describing a change you want to make—the context, plan, and rationale. Run `/ticket your change request` and a coding agent explores both codebase and history, then writes the ticket for you. Committed alongside the code, tickets become searchable history for future coding agents.\n\nOnce tickets are queued, `/drive` implements them one by one with confirmation at each step. While one agent drives, others can keep creating tickets—no git worktree overhead, just serial execution with clear commits. The bottleneck is human cognition, not implementation speed.\n\nWhen ready to deliver, `/report` generates changelogs and PR descriptions from the accumulated ticket history. No manual summarization—the intent behind each change is already documented, so the narrative writes itself.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **A flavor of Spec-Driven Development**\n>\n> Workaholic follows [Spec-Driven Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) principles with distinct terminology:\n>\n> - **Ticket**: A change request describing what should be different (flowing, temporal)\n> - **Spec**: Current state documentation describing what exists now (snapshot, persistent)\n>\n> Tickets drive implementation; specs document the result. Both are markdown, both are versioned, but they serve complementary purposes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWorking artifacts live in [.workaholic/](.workaholic/README.md):\n\n- **guides/** - User documentation\n- **specs/** - Technical specifications\n- **stories/** - Development narratives per branch\n- **terms/** - Consistent term definitions\n- **tickets/** - Work queue and archives\n\n## Author\n\ntamurayoshiya <a@qmu.jp>\n",
        "plugins/core/README.md": "# Core\n\nCore development workflow for Claude Code projects.\n\n## Why Documentation?\n\nThis plugin intentionally generates extensive documentation artifacts (tickets, changelogs, archives) as **cognitive investments**. Developer cognitive load is the primary bottleneck in software productivity - context-switching, onboarding, and understanding past decisions consume significant mental energy.\n\nEach artifact reduces this load:\n\n- **Tickets** capture intent before implementation, preventing \"what was I trying to do?\"\n- **Specs** provide authoritative reference for current state, eliminating guesswork\n- **Stories** preserve the narrative of how decisions were made across a feature\n- **Changelogs** explain what changed and why, enabling quick catch-up\n\nThe upfront cost of documentation pays dividends when you (or a teammate) return to code weeks later.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command                 | Description                                                                      |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `/ticket <description>` | Explore codebase and write implementation ticket (auto-creates branch on main)   |\n| `/drive`                | Implement tickets from .workaholic/tickets/ one by one, commit each, and archive |\n| `/scan`                 | Full documentation scan (all 17 agents)                                          |\n| `/report`               | Generate story and create/update pull request                                    |\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent                 | Description                                             |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `performance-analyst` | Evaluate decision-making quality across five viewpoints |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill            | Description                                                              |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `archive-ticket` | Complete commit workflow - format, archive, update changelog, and commit |\n\n## Rules\n\n| Rule            | Description                                              |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `general.md`    | General development rules (commit confirmation required) |\n| `typescript.md` | TypeScript coding conventions                            |\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Plan work**: Use `/ticket` to write implementation specs (auto-creates branch on main)\n2. **Implement tickets**: Use `/drive` to implement and commit each ticket\n3. **Create PR**: Use `/report` to generate story and create PR\n\n## Feedback Loop\n\nWhen reviewing an implementation and requesting changes:\n\n1. **Update the ticket first** - Add/modify steps based on feedback\n2. **Then implement** - Make the requested changes\n3. **Review again** - Ask for approval once more\n\n```\nUser:   [Needs changes] \"Add error handling for edge case X\"\nClaude: [Updates ticket with new step for error handling]\nClaude: [Implements error handling]\nClaude: [Asks for review again]\n```\n\n**Why this matters**: Archived tickets become project documentation. Keeping tickets updated ensures accurate history of what was built and helps future developers understand the full scope of changes.\n\n## Ticket Storage\n\n- Active tickets: `.workaholic/tickets/todo/`\n- Icebox (deferred): `.workaholic/tickets/icebox/`\n- Archived: `.workaholic/tickets/archive/<branch-name>/`\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd to your Claude Code configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"core\"]\n}\n```\n"
