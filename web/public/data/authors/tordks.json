        "README.md": "# Claude Workflow\n\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2.2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/tordks/claude-workflow/releases)\n[![Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude%20Code-Plugin-purple.svg)](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nClaude Workflow (CWF) defines a plan-driven development workflow for Claude Code with phase-based implementation.\n\nCWF is my personal exploration of agent development workflows. Other frameworks vary in rigor and documentation requirements, but most share the core concept of persisting specifications to maintain context between session. See links to other resources below.\n\n## What Problem Does CWF Solve?\n\nAI-assisted development often faces these challenges:\n\n1. **Lost Implementation Context:** When context clears, gets compacted, or sessions end, implementation details vanish. Architectural decisions, component relationships, and technical rationale all disappear, forcing agents to re-derive or guess.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Quality:** Without documented standards or quality control, implementation quality varies unpredictably. One session produces well-structured code with proper error handling; the next produces a 500-line function that mixes concerns.\n\n3. **Plan Evolution Lost:** When implementation reveals gaps and needed changes, amended requirements remain buried in conversation. New sessions start with the original flawed plan, repeating the same discovery process.\n\n4. **Loss of Control:** Agents can make dozens of changes at once, and without oversight mechanisms, developers lose control of what is being built. Instructions are often underspecified, so agents guess at developer intent and implementations quickly go off the rails—either building the wrong thing entirely or taking opaque approaches that require investigation to understand. Without checkpoints for human review and quality control, problems compound before they're caught.\n\n## The Workflow\n\n```text\n  /brainstorm (optional)\n         ↓\n  Design Summary\n         ↓\n     /write-plan\n         ↓\n   Plan + Tasklist\n         ↓\n   /implement-plan\n         ↓\n  Phase 1 → Checkpoints → Review → ✓ → /clear\n         ↓\n Phase 2 → Checkpoints → Review → ✓ → /clear\n  [Changes?] → /amend-plan ──┐\n         ↓                   │\n  Continue development ←─────┘\n         ↓\n  Feature Complete ✓\n```\n\n## When to use CWF\n\nClaude Code has different modes for different types of work. CWF is a workflow framework that adds structure for complex, multi-session development.\n\n**Use regular chat mode when:**\n\n- Single-session work\n- Quick fixes or simple features\n- No architectural decisions needed\n- Informal exploration\n\n**Use plan mode when:**\n\n- Starting more complex features\n- You want to review the work before implementation starts\n\nPlan mode lets Claude read and analyze without editing or executing. Great for careful deliberation before implementation.\n\n**Use CWF when:**\n\n- Work spans multiple sessions\n- Need to adjust plans during implementation\n- Need reviewable checkpoints with runnable code\n\nCWF adds persistent plan documents you can review and safely modify during implementation. In plan mode, evolving requirements and discovered gaps remain implicit and it can be hard to know that the agent applies amendments as intended.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall as plugin in Claude Code:\n\n1. `/plugin marketplace add tordks/claude-workflow` - adds repository to your marketplace\n2. `/plugin install cwf@claude-workflow` - installs the plugin\n\nTo uninstall: `/plugin uninstall cwf@claude-workflow`\n\n## How It Works\n\nCWF preserves context across sessions by storing planning and progress in structured documents. It uses two key mechanisms:\n\n**Skills** provide specialized knowledge to Claude as self-contained packages. The `claude-workflow` skill contains all CWF workflow knowledge (plan structure, tasklist format, amendment rules, etc.) that agents need to execute the workflow. Skills are loaded on-demand to keep context focused.\n\n**Commands** are called by users to orchestrate the workflow. They provide instructions that guide agents through each stage and automatically load relevant skills.\n\n### Command Reference\n\n| Command | When to Use | What It Does |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| `/brainstorm [feature-name] [instructions]` | During planning | Structured exploration with guided questions, alternatives analysis, produces design summary |\n| `/write-plan <feature-name> [instructions]` | After planning | Writes planning documents |\n| `/implement-plan <feature-name> [instructions]` | Start/Resume implementation | Executes tasks task-by-task and phase-by-phase with quality checkpoints |\n| `/amend-plan <feature-name> [instructions]` | Requirements changed or gaps identified | Updates plan/tasklist safely |\n\nArguments: `<feature-name>` is required (except for brainstorm). `[instructions]` are optional free-form text for additional context or constraints.\n\n### Skill Reference\n\n| Skill | Contains | How It's Used |\n|-------|----------|---------------|\n| `claude-workflow` | Planning structure, phase patterns, task format, amendment rules | Loaded by cwf commands |\n\n### Planning\n\nThe planning phase is about solidifying the specifications for the feature we are about to implement, and make sure we have all the information for an agent to perform the implementation.\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Have an informal planning discussion with the agent\n- Use `/brainstorm` for structured exploration with guided questions and alternatives analysis\n- Provide a written specification file\n\nThe `/brainstorm` command systematically extracts requirements, explores alternatives, and produces a design summary that can serve as input for `/write-plan`.\n\nAfter solidifying the specification, run `/write-plan` to create the planning documents in `.cwf/{feature-name}/` at your project root:\n\n- **Plan** `.cwf/{feature-name}/{feature-name}-plan.md`: Captures WHY/WHAT—architectural decisions, design rationale, alternatives considered\n- **Tasklist** `.cwf/{feature-name}/{feature-name}-tasklist.md`: Defines WHEN/HOW—sequential phases with checkbox tracking `[x]`\n- **Mockup** `.cwf/{feature-name}/{feature-name}-mockup.html` (optional): Visual reference for UI/frontend features\n\nThe plan divides work into phases that each produce runnable code. Each phase ends with **checkpoints**—validation operations that ensure code quality before proceeding:\n\n- **Self-review:** Agent reviews implementation against phase deliverable\n- **Code quality checks:** Linting, formatting, type checking—runs whatever tools the project already uses (e.g., eslint, prettier, mypy, ruff)\n- **Complexity checks:** Code complexity analysis—runs if project has complexity tools configured\n\nThese checkpoints provide quality control, catching issues early before they accumulate (ie. ever-increasing function- or file size). After checkpoints pass, implementation stops for human review before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Be specific about requirements, components, and technologies\n- Set clear scope (what's IN and OUT of this feature)\n- Before writing the plan, ask the agent to write svg or mermaid diagrams. Especially useful for webapps to confirm layout understanding, or for database schemas.\n- For UI/frontend features, request an HTML mockup to verify layout understanding before implementation. The agent will create a single HTML file with inline CSS that you can open in a browser.\n- For multi-session planning, save discussion to file and reload when resuming\n- Use plan mode to get an initial plan draft that can be fed into `/write-plan`\n- You can focus on specific parts of a discussion/spec and provide file inputs: `/write-plan user-auth only make a plan for the authentication layer described in my-spec-file.md`\n- Create `.claude/rules/` files for project-specific coding standards when CLAUDE.md grows large. See <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude/rules/>.\n\n### Implementation\n\nRun `/implement-plan` to start implementing the feature. The agent continues from the next incomplete task in the tasklist, allowing you to resume with clear context.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Review at phase boundaries before approving\n- Run `/clear` often to maintain fresh context\n- If context allows, write \"continue to next phase\" instead of clearing to speed up development\n- You can add instructions to `/implement-plan`: `/implement-plan user-auth phase 1, 2 and 3, then stop`\n- Use `/amend-plan` when requirements change (don't work around the plan)\n- Use CLAUDE.md in subfolders to help facilitate discovery\n- Use subagents to run independent phases/tasks in parallel or to preserve main instance context: `/implement-plan user-auth use subagents to implement phase 1 and 2 in parallel, enforce phase 2 for second subagent`\n\n### Amending Plans\n\nIf requirements change during implementation or you discover a gap in the plan, use `/amend-plan` to update the plan and tasklist safely.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- For complex amendments, `/clear` and discuss changes first, you might even want to use `/brainstorm <initial-description-of-change>`\n- Add change description for amendments that might not need discussion: `/amend-plan my-cli-tool the cli needs an --output option`\n- Keep the plan updated—it's the agent's source of truth\n- **Warning:** Changing implementation without amending the plan causes confusion after `/clear` and will likely result in an erroneous implementation.\n\n### Project Rules (Optional)\n\nClaude Code supports modular rules in `.claude/rules/` for principles and standards that apply to the repository. All `.md` files in this directory are automatically loaded with the same priority as CLAUDE.md.\n\nRules accept a yaml frontmatter that specify conditions for when the rules are to be loaded into context. For example:\n\n```yaml\npaths: **/*.py\n```\n\nSpecifies a rule that should only be loaded when considering python files.\n\nRead more here: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude/rules/>\n\n**You don't need separate rules files.** It's a convenience to avoid long, unwieldy CLAUDE.md files. When your CLAUDE.md grows large with coding standards and principles, move that content to `.claude/rules/` files instead.\n\n**What goes where:**\n\n- **CLAUDE.md** - Repository context, structure, navigation\n- **`.claude/rules/`** - Coding principles, standards, guidelines\n\nExample rules files (see `claude-rules-example/`):\n\n- **Software Engineering Principles:** DRY, YAGNI, orthogonality, separation of concerns\n- **Testing Philosophy:** Test coverage expectations, testing patterns\n- **Language Standards:** Python-specific conventions and best practices\n\n## Alternatives & Resources\n\nBelow are related projects and resources.
