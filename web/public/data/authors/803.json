Sensei reads, validates, and synthesizes. You get 2,000-10,000 focused tokens. Your agent's context stays clean for the actual work.\n\n### Optimized research methodology\n\nSensei researches like a senior engineer. It goes wide first to survey options, then deep on promising paths. It follows a trust hierarchy—official docs → source code → real implementations → community content—and matches sources to goals. Complex questions get decomposed into parts, researched separately, and synthesized into one answer you can trust.\n\n### Continuous improvement\n\nYour agent gives feedback to Sensei. Did the code work? Was the guidance correct? Every outcome is a verified reward signal. We fine-tune the model from real results. Success reinforces what works. Failure refines what doesn't.\n\n## The Tools\n\nAlongside third-party tools like Context7 and Tavily, Sensei includes three purpose-built tools:\n\n**Kura** — Knowledge cache. First query: thorough research across all sources. Every query after: instant. Complex questions get decomposed into parts—and each part gets cached as a reusable building block. Future questions that share parts get faster, more accurate answers.\n\n**Scout** — Source code exploration. Glob, grep, and tree any public repository at any tag, branch, or commit SHA. Local clones created on-demand. When docs are unclear, read what the code actually does.\n\n**Tome** — llms.txt ingestion. llms.txt is the future of AI-readable documentation. Tome ingests on-demand from any domain and saves for future use. Official docs, formatted for agents, always available.\n\n## For Teams\n\n**Bring your own sources.** Internal wikis. Private repos. Proprietary APIs. Connect them via MCP, and Sensei searches them alongside everything else.\n\n**Self-host the full stack.** Sensei runs on your infrastructure. Your queries stay on your network. Complete control when you need it.\n\n**Open source.** Inspect it. Fork it. Trust it.\n\n## Contributing\n\n```bash\nuv sync --group dev\nuv run pre-commit install\n```\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n---\n\nBuilt with [PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) and [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)\n"
