You can also define it explicitly to be more tailored to the specific project.\n\nThe Dockerfile should build upon `quay.io/submariner/shipyard-dapper-base`.\n\nFor example, this very basic file allows E2E testing:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM quay.io/submariner/shipyard-dapper-base:devel\n\nENV DAPPER_SOURCE=/go/src/github.com/submariner-io/submariner DAPPER_DOCKER_SOCKET=true\nENV DAPPER_OUTPUT=${DAPPER_SOURCE}/output\n\nWORKDIR ${DAPPER_SOURCE}\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"./scripts/entry\"]\nCMD [\"ci\"]\n```\n\nYou can also refer to the project's own [Dockerfile.dapper](Dockerfile.dapper) as an example.\n\n### Makefile\n\nThe Makefile should include targets to run everything in Dapper.\nThey're defined in [Makefile.dapper](Makefile.dapper) and can be copied as-is and included, but it's best to download and import it.\nTo use Shipyard's target, simply include the [Makefile.inc](Makefile.inc) file in your own Makefile.\n\nThe simplest Makefile would look like this:\n\n```Makefile\nBASE_BRANCH=devel\nPROJECT=shipyard\nSHIPYARD_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/submariner-io/shipyard/$(BASE_BRANCH)\nexport BASE_BRANCH PROJECT SHIPYARD_URL\n\nifneq (,$(DAPPER_HOST_ARCH))\n\n# Running in Dapper\n\ninclude $(SHIPYARD_DIR)/Makefile.inc\n\nelse\n\n# Not running in Dapper\n\nMakefile.dapper:\n        @echo Downloading $@\n        @curl -sfLO $(SHIPYARD_URL)/$@\n\ninclude Makefile.dapper\n\nendif\n\n# Disable rebuilding Makefile\nMakefile Makefile.dapper Makefile.inc: ;\n```\n\nYou can also refer to the project's own [Makefile](Makefile) as an example.\n\n## Releases\n\nGet the latest version from the [Releases] page.\n\n<!--links-->\n[go 1.12]: https://blog.golang.org/go1.12\n[docker]: https://docs.docker.com/install/\n[$GOPATH configured]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH\n[Releases]: https://github.com/submariner-io/shipyard/releases/\n[kind]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind\n"
