        "README.md": "# OpenClaw Manager Plugin for Claude Code\n\n[![Claude Code Plugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude%20Code-Plugin-6B5CE7?style=flat-square)](https://code.claude.com)\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-blue?style=flat-square)](CHANGELOG.md)\n\n> **If you can use Claude Code, you can use OpenClaw.** This plugin democratizes access to powerful AI-to-messaging integrations—no DevOps expertise required.\n\n[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (formerly known as **ClawdBot**) is an AI gateway that connects Claude and other LLMs to messaging platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord. This plugin turns Claude Code into your personal OpenClaw expert—handling installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and security hardening through natural conversation.\n\n**This is a weekend project built to help more people access OpenClaw.** The setup process can be intimidating for newcomers, so we wrapped all that complexity into a conversational interface. Just tell Claude what you want, and it handles the rest.\n\n## Why This Plugin?\n\nSetting up OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot) manually involves:\n- Installing dependencies (Node.js v22+, systemd)\n- Creating OAuth apps and managing tokens\n- Configuring channel policies and access controls\n- Setting up cron jobs and webhooks\n- Hardening security settings\n- Debugging connection issues\n\n**That's a lot to ask of someone who just wants to chat with Claude from Slack.**\n\nWith this plugin, you just say what you want:\n\n```\n> /openclaw-manager install on WSL2\n> /openclaw-manager setup Slack channel\n> /openclaw-manager troubleshoot gateway not responding\n> /openclaw-manager security audit\n```\n\nClaude handles the rest—running commands, checking configurations, explaining what's happening, and fixing issues.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\n**From GitHub (recommended):**\n```bash\nclaude plugin install github:ClariSortAi/openclaw-manager-plugin\n```\n\n**From local directory:**\n```bash\nclaude plugin install /path/to/openclaw-manager-plugin\n```\n\n**For development:**\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./openclaw-manager-plugin\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce installed, invoke the skill:\n\n```bash\n# Interactive mode - Claude guides you\n/openclaw-manager\n\n# Specific tasks\n/openclaw-manager install on macOS\n/openclaw-manager configure WhatsApp\n/openclaw-manager troubleshoot connection issues\n/openclaw-manager setup cron job for daily summary\n/openclaw-manager security hardening\n```\n\nOr just describe what you need in natural language—Claude will automatically use this skill when you mention OpenClaw.\n\n## What Can It Do?\n\n| Task | Example |\n|------|---------|\n| **Fresh Install** | `Help me install OpenClaw on Ubuntu` |\n| **Channel Setup** | `Configure Slack with Socket Mode` |\n| **Troubleshooting** | `My WhatsApp keeps disconnecting` |\n| **Security** | `Audit my OpenClaw security settings` |\n| **Automation** | `Set up a daily standup reminder cron job` |\n| **Configuration** | `Change my gateway to allowlist mode` |\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n- **Slack** - Socket Mode with OAuth scopes\n- **WhatsApp** - QR code linking, multi-account support\n- **Telegram** - BotFather integration\n- **Discord** - Bot token and privileged intents\n- **iMessage** - macOS native integration\n\n### Supported Operating Systems\n\n- macOS (native)\n- Linux (native, systemd)\n- Windows (WSL2 required)\n\n## Plugin Contents\n\n```\nopenclaw-manager-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json              # Plugin manifest\n├── skills/\n│   └── openclaw-manager/\n│       ├── SKILLS.md            # Main skill definition\n│       ├── cli-reference.md     # Complete CLI command reference\n│       ├── troubleshooting.md   # Common issues and solutions\n│       ├── channel-setup.md     # Platform-specific setup guides\n│       └── security-checklist.md # Security hardening guide\n├── README.md\n├── CHANGELOG.md\n├── CONTRIBUTING.md\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Claude Code** v1.0.33 or later\n- For OpenClaw itself:\n  - Node.js v22+ (NOT Bun—causes WhatsApp/Telegram issues)\n  - macOS, Linux, or Windows WSL2\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis plugin provides Claude with comprehensive OpenClaw knowledge through structured documentation:\n\n1. **Skill Definition** (`SKILLS.md`) - Core capabilities and decision-making guidance\n2. **CLI Reference** - Every command, flag, and configuration path\n3. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Diagnostic workflows and common fixes\n4. **Channel Setup** - Platform-specific OAuth, tokens, and configurations\n5. **Security Checklist** - Hardening recommendations and audit procedures\n\nClaude reads these documents and uses them to guide you through any OpenClaw task, running the right commands and explaining each step.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Installing OpenClaw\n\n```\nYou: Help me install OpenClaw on my Mac\n\nClaude: I'll guide you through installing OpenClaw on macOS. Let me first check\nif you have the prerequisites...\n\n[Runs: node --version]\n\nYou have Node.js v22.1.0 - perfect. Now let's install the CLI...\n\n[Runs: curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash]\n\nCLI installed. Running the onboarding wizard with daemon setup...\n\n[Runs: openclaw onboard --install-daemon]\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n```\nYou: My Slack bot isn't responding to messages\n\nClaude: Let me diagnose your Slack connection. First, checking overall status...\n\n[Runs: openclaw status --all]\n\nI see the gateway is running but Slack shows \"missing_scope\" error. This means\nyour Slack app is missing required OAuth permissions. The missing scope appears\nto be `im:write`.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n1. Go to api.slack.com/apps → Your app\n2. OAuth & Permissions → Add `im:write` scope\n3. Reinstall to Workspace\n\nThen we'll update your token...\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
