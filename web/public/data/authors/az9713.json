        "README.md": "# Tiger Intelligence\n\n**Identify and protect the tiger teams that actually run your organization.**\n\nTiger Intelligence is a Claude Code plugin suite that helps organizations understand where real value comes from - not the org chart, but the actual network of people who fix things when they break.\n\nBased on [Nate Jones' framework](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/grab-the-4-prompts-i-use-to-make) for making messy work legible without killing what made it valuable.\n\n## The Problem\n\nEvery organization has two structures:\n- **The official structure**: Org charts, RACI matrices, dashboards, OKRs\n- **The real structure**: The people who actually get called when something is on fire\n\nAI makes it cheap to generate beautiful dashboards that look authoritative. But these \"single pane of glass\" tools often strangle the very people who keep organizations running - while leadership becomes overconfident in the wrong map.\n\n## The Solution\n\nTiger Intelligence flips the script:\n- Instead of surveillance dashboards, give small teams execution power\n- Instead of AI bureaucrats dictating work, use AI as a historian reconstructing what happened\n- Instead of fake legibility, create real understanding of where value comes from\n\n## System Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   DATA INTEGRATION LAYER                 │\n│  MCP Servers: GitHub, Slack, Jira, Linear, Notion,      │\n│               PagerDuty, Google Docs, Calendar          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                            │\n        ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐\n        ▼                   ▼                   ▼\n┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐\n│  FOR LEADERS  │   │   FOR ICs     │   │  FOR PM/LEADS │\n├───────────────┤   ├───────────────┤   ├───────────────┤\n│ Tiger Team    │   │ \"Am I a       │   │ Tiger         │\n│ Identifier    │   │  Tiger?\"      │   │ Dependency    │\n│               │   │               │   │ Map           │\n│ Map Audit     │   │ Visibility    │   │ Tiger Health  │\n│               │   │ Gap Finder    │   │ Monitor       │\n└───────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\nAdd the Tiger Intelligence marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add github:your-username/tiger-intelligence\n```\n\nThen install the plugins you need:\n\n```bash\n# For Individual Contributors\nclaude plugin install tiger-ics@tiger-intelligence\n\n# For Leaders/Executives\nclaude plugin install tiger-leaders@tiger-intelligence\n\n# For PMs and Team Leads\nclaude plugin install tiger-leads@tiger-intelligence\n\n# Shared data layer (recommended - enables richer analysis)\nclaude plugin install tiger-core@tiger-intelligence\n```\n\n### Local Development\n\nTest the plugins locally:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/tiger-intelligence.git\ncd tiger-intelligence\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/tiger-ics\n```\n\n## Plugins & Skills\n\n### tiger-core (Data Integration Layer)\n\nShared MCP server configurations for connecting to:\n- **GitHub**: Commits, PRs, code ownership, incident patterns\n- **Slack**: @mentions, DMs during crises, channel activity\n- **Jira/Linear**: Issue assignments, escalations, sprint patterns\n- **Notion**: Documentation ownership, wiki contributions\n- **PagerDuty**: On-call patterns, incident response\n- **Google Docs**: Document collaboration patterns\n- **Google Calendar**: Meeting patterns, 1:1s, war rooms\n\nConfigure credentials in your environment - skills gracefully degrade when data sources aren't available.\n\n### tiger-ics (For Individual Contributors)\n\n**Am I a Tiger?**\n> Discover if you're carrying more organizational weight than your job title suggests.\n\nAnalyzes your contribution patterns to reveal if you're a \"tiger\" - one of those key people who actually keeps things running. Get a Tiger Score, contribution map, and visibility strategy.\n\n**Visibility Gap Finder**\n> Find where your valuable work falls through the cracks.\n\nMaps the gap between what you actually do and what shows up in formal systems. Creates impact briefs, proof lists, and visibility plans - without turning you into a self-promoter.\n\n### tiger-leaders (For Leaders & Executives)\n\n**Tiger Team Identifier**\n> Map who actually keeps your organization running.\n\nAnalyzes emergency patterns, escalation paths, and informal influence to find your tiger teams. Produces risk assessments, de-risking plans, and protection recommendations.\n\n**Map Audit**\n> Evaluate if your dashboards measure reality or generate noise.\n\nAudits metrics, dashboards, and AI-generated reports for validity, gaming potential, and blind spots. Trust more, trust less, or trust differently.\n\n### tiger-leads (For PMs & Team Leads)\n\n**Tiger Dependency Map**\n> Understand which key people your roadmap secretly depends on.\n\nMaps single points of failure, knowledge dependencies, and bottleneck patterns. Creates risk matrices and mitigation plans.\n\n**Tiger Health Monitor**\n> Prevent burnout and knowledge loss in your key contributors.\n\nAnalyzes workload patterns, off-hours activity, on-call burden, and stress signals. Provides early warning and intervention recommendations.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Am I a Tiger?\n\n```\nYou: Am I a tiger on this team?\n\nClaude: I'll help you figure that out. Let me start by asking:\nWhat do you actually spend your time on in a typical week -\nnot your job title, the actual work?\n```\n\n> **See a real conversation**: [Full test run transcript](https://gisthost.github.io/?bda76c838b3cb0786333867f96bd0a52/index.html) | [Annotated analysis](examples/test-runs/am-i-a-tiger-test-run.md)\n\n### Tiger Team Identifier\n\n```\nYou: Help me identify the tiger teams in my org\n\nClaude: Let's start with a concrete situation. Tell me about\nthe last real emergency in your organization - something that\nwas genuinely high-stakes - and who handled it.\n```\n\n### Map Audit\n\n```\nYou: I want to audit our engineering velocity dashboard\n\nClaude: Let's dig in. What is this dashboard called,\nand what does it claim to measure?\n```\n\n## Data Source Configuration\n\nSet environment variables for the integrations you want to use:\n\n```bash\n# GitHub\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_pat\n\n# Slack\nexport SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...\nexport SLACK_TEAM_ID=T...\n\n# Jira\nexport JIRA_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net\nexport JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@company.com\nexport JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token\n\n# Linear\nexport LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...\n\n# Notion\nexport NOTION_API_KEY=secret_...\n\n# PagerDuty\nexport PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN=your_token\n\n# Google (for Drive and Calendar)\nexport GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...\nexport GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...\nexport GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=...\n```\n\nSkills work without data sources (using conversational exploration), but get significantly better with access to real data.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis toolkit is based on several key ideas:\n\n1. **Tiger teams are the real production engine** - Small groups of trusted people with shared context produce more value than large formal structures\n\n2. **AI as historian, not bureaucrat** - Use AI to reconstruct what happened after messy work is done, not to dictate structure from above\n\n3. **Legibility should follow work** - Make work visible to leadership without strangling the people doing it\n\n4. **Protect fast paths** - Don't stuff everything into controlled pipelines; let teams spike on problems\n\n5. **Measure outcomes, not adherence** - Track what teams deliver, not whether they followed an AI-generated plan\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
