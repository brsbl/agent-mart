        "README.md": "# team-plan\n\nOne command to go from task description to a coordinated [Agent Team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams).\n\nAgent Teams are powerful but using them well requires thought — team composition, task dependencies, file ownership, spawn context, plan approval. This skill wraps the [official best practices](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams#best-practices) into a repeatable workflow so you get a well-structured team every time.\n\n```\n/team-plan <task>\n```\n\n```\nScout (subagents)  →  Plan (plan mode)  →  You approve  →  Agent Team executes\n```\n\n## Why\n\nWithout this skill, using Agent Teams typically means:\n- Telling Claude to \"create a team\" and hoping it designs a good one\n- Teammates that lack context because they don't inherit the lead's history\n- File conflicts when two teammates edit the same file\n- No review gate before high-risk changes\n\nThis skill fixes that by requiring a structured plan **before** any team is spawned:\n\n- **Scout first** — Subagents explore the codebase and research external knowledge in parallel, so the plan is grounded in facts, not assumptions\n- **Plan with team design** — The plan explicitly defines roles, models, file ownership, task dependencies, and spawn context for each teammate\n- **Plan approval for high-risk teammates** — Teammates making dangerous changes must get their approach approved before writing code ([official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams#require-plan-approval-for-teammates))\n- **No file conflicts** — The plan enforces that no two teammates write the same file ([official best practice](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams#best-practices))\n- **Spawn context** — Each teammate's prompt is planned with the specific context they need, because they don't inherit the lead's conversation history\n- **You approve before execution** — Nothing runs until you review the plan\n\n## Install\n\n### Plugin Marketplace (recommended)\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add zhangxin840/team-plan-skill\n/plugin install team-plan@team-plan-skills\n```\n\n### npx\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add zhangxin840/team-plan-skill\n```\n\n### Manual\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zhangxin840/team-plan-skill.git\ncp -r team-plan-skill/plugins/team-plan/skills/team-plan ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/team-plan Refactor src/auth/ from session-based to JWT authentication\n```\n\n```\n/team-plan Research Claude Code v2.1.35 changes, produce upgrade report and articles\n```\n\n```\n/team-plan Review and update all API documentation to match current implementation\n```\n\n## What the plan covers\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Task Analysis** | Scope, boundaries, risks — refined from scout findings |\n| **Team Design** | Each teammate: name, role, agent type, model, owned files, plan approval requirements |\n| **Task Breakdown** | Tasks with owners, `blockedBy` dependencies, acceptance criteria |\n| **Phase Sequence** | What runs in parallel, what must wait |\n| **File Ownership** | Explicit map — no two teammates write the same file |\n| **Spawn Context** | Key context for each teammate's prompt |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nAgent Teams must be enabled in `~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Design\n\n- **Minimal skill, maximum autonomy** — 30 lines of instructions. Only enforces scout → plan → approve. Execution is left entirely to Claude.\n- **Works in any project** — No hardcoded paths. Agents discover structure from CLAUDE.md and project conventions.\n- **Built on official best practices** — Plan approval, file ownership, spawn context, task sizing — all from the [Agent Teams docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams#best-practices).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
