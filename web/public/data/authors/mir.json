        "README.md": "maratai\n=======\n\nReusable prompts, command templates, and helper scripts that keep Marat's\nmulti-agent coding assistants in sync. The repository centralizes the\ninstructions used by Claude Code and OpenCode so they can be edited once and\nre-used across tools.\n\nRepository Layout\n-----------------\n- `claude-maratai-dev/` (v1.0.1) – Claude Code plugin for development workflows with\n  agents and commands for project search, code review, specification creation, and\n  web research. Includes deepwiki MCP server for GitHub repository documentation.\n- `claude-maratai-manager/` (v1.5.0) – Claude Code plugin for management workflows\n  with Atlassian integration (Jira & Confluence), Google Docs/Sheets export, and\n  weekly reporting tools.\n- `opencode/` – OpenCode-compatible copies of the same prompts (folder names are\n  singular: `agent/` and `command/`); also contains `opencode.json` with local\n  MCP and formatter settings.\n- `transfer_from_claude.py` – utility that copies Markdown from\n  `claude-maratai-dev/` and `claude-maratai-manager/` to `opencode/`,\n  transforming frontmatter for OpenCode format.\n- `sync_opencode.sh` – helper script that syncs the local prompts into\n  OpenCode's configuration directory (`~/.config/opencode/`), including orphan\n  cleanup.\n\nDaily Workflow\n--------------\n1. Edit or add prompts inside `claude-maratai-dev/` (or `claude-maratai-manager/`\n   for management tools) first so metadata stays consistent across platforms.\n2. Run `./transfer_from_claude.py` (requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))\n   to refresh the OpenCode copies with proper frontmatter transformation.\n3. Use the sync script when you are ready to try the prompts locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./sync_opencode.sh         # sync opencode/ → ~/.config/opencode/\n   ./sync_opencode.sh -n      # dry-run (preview changes)\n   ./sync_opencode.sh -d      # show diffs for changed files\n   ./sync_opencode.sh -n -d   # dry-run with diffs\n   ```\n\n   The script creates missing directories, replaces existing files, and removes\n   orphaned files in the target that no longer exist in source.\n\nAdding or Updating Prompts\n--------------------------\n- Keep YAML front matter at the top of each Markdown file; Claude and OpenCode\n  rely on the metadata.\n- Prefer short, action-oriented descriptions and keep output format sections in\n  Markdown so they render cleanly in every client.\n- Confirm any Mermaid diagrams render by pasting them into your client before\n  shipping changes.\n\nCommand Reference (maratai-dev)\n-------------------------------\n- **`commands/commit.md`** – auto-commit flow. Captures outstanding changes,\n  branches off `master` when needed, stages, commits with a concise message,\n  pushes, and prompts the user to file a merge request via `glab`.\n- **`commands/plan.md`** – deep implementation planner. Collects inputs, drafts\n  a markdown plan with architecture/data-flow diagrams, task checklist, and\n  then invokes the plan-spec-reviewer agent.\n- **`commands/prepare-feature.md`** – orchestration command that reforms a\n  feature request, then spawns `project-search`, `web-research`, and `spec`\n  agents in parallel and enforces numbered outputs under `docs/<feature>/`.\n- **`commands/explain-feature.md`** – documentation generator for a specific\n  feature. Produces overview, sequence and flow diagrams, and a\n  component-by-component walkthrough with file references and state changes.\n- **`commands/fix-mermaid.md`** – fixes Mermaid diagram syntax errors in\n  markdown files, ensuring diagrams render correctly.\n\nCommand Reference (maratai-manager)\n-----------------------------------\n- **`commands/week_report.md`** – weekly status writer. Summarizes recent work\n  per project and prepares (but does not send) a Slack payload with the\n  formatted report.\n\nAgent Reference (maratai-dev)\n-----------------------------\n- **`agents/project-search.md`** – scans the codebase for relevant files, outputs\n  references, lightweight snippets, diagrams, and a trimmed summary in `docs/`.\n- **`agents/product-spec.md`** – business-facing specification writer that\n  distills user stories, functional requirements, edge cases, and a minimal\n  end-to-end test plan without touching implementation details.\n- **`agents/web-research.md`** – external research assistant that prioritizes\n  credible sources (forums, docs, DeepWiki) and records pros/cons and\n  recommendations inside `docs/`.\n- **`agents/plan-spec-reviewer.md`** – reviewer that compares an implementation\n  plan against a specification, logs critical gaps, and calculates coverage\n  metrics in a standalone markdown report.\n\nMCP Server Reference (maratai-dev)\n----------------------------------\n- **`deepwiki`** – Remote MCP server for querying GitHub repository documentation\n  via DeepWiki. Provides tools for reading wiki structure, viewing content, and\n  asking questions about repositories. Connects to `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse`.\n\nSkill Reference (maratai-manager)\n---------------------------------\n- **`skills/jira-confluence/`** – Jira and Confluence integration via OAuth 2.0.\n  Access issues, projects, sprints, and wiki pages through Python scripts with\n  compact YAML output to save tokens. Run `scripts/auth.py login` for setup.\n  Includes workflow references:\n  - **`references/jira_cleanup.md`** – ticket hygiene workflow for analyzing\n    stale tickets, finding duplicates, and cleaning up backlogs.\n  - **`references/jira_status_update.md`** – matches git commits from the last\n    7 days against Jira tickets to draft status update comments.\n- **`skills/google-docs-sheets/`** – Export Google Docs and Google Sheets to\n  Markdown. Uses Google APIs with read-only scopes. Prefers gcloud ADC\n  authentication with browser OAuth fallback. Useful for ingesting Google\n  Workspace content for summarization or analysis.\n\nClaude Code Plugins\n-------------------\nTo install the Claude Code plugins, run these commands inside Claude Code's\ninteractive mode:\n\n1. Add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add mir/maratai\n   ```\n\n2. Install the plugins:\n   ```\n   /plugin install maratai-dev@maratai    # Development workflows\n   /plugin install maratai-manager@maratai # Management workflows (Atlassian)\n   ```\n\n3. Verify installation:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace list   # List configured marketplaces\n   /plugin                    # Open interactive plugin browser\n   ```\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n- The transfer script transforms Claude Code frontmatter to OpenCode format\n  (removes `name`, `model`, `tools` fields; adds `mode: subagent` for agents).\n- When new dependencies are needed for the Python script, update the inline\n  `uv` metadata block inside `transfer_from_claude.py`.\n- Keep an eye on trailing commas in JSON files such as\n  `opencode/opencode.json`; OpenCode validation may be stricter than local\n  tooling.\n- The `sync_opencode.sh` script removes orphaned files from `~/.config/opencode/`\n  that don't exist in `opencode/`. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes first.\n"
