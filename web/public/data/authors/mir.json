Pages with \"architecture\" in title\n- `space=TEAM AND lastModified >= now('-7d')` - Recent team pages\n- `creator=currentUser()` - My pages\n- `label='important'` - Pages with label\n\n# Download page tree(s)\n```bash\n# Download a page and all its descendants with nested folders\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py tree 123456789 --output-dir ./exports/\n\n# Download multiple page trees (e.g., sibling pages in a space)\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py tree 123456789 987654321 --output-dir ./exports/\n\n# With JSON format instead of markdown\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py tree 123456789 --output-dir ./exports/ --format json\n\n# Limit recursion depth\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py tree 123456789 --output-dir ./exports/ --max-depth 3\n```\n\nCreates properly nested folder structure with `toc.md` table of contents:\n```\nexports/\n  toc.md                    # Table of contents with links\n  Page_Title_123/\n    index.md\n    Child_Page_456/\n      index.md\n      Grandchild_789/\n        index.md\n```\n\n# Export pages to files\n```bash\n# Export to markdown files\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py export \"space=TEAM\" --format markdown --output-dir ./exports/\n\n# Export to stdout (yaml default)\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py export \"type=page AND title~'architecture'\"\n\n# Export to JSON\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py export \"space=TEAM\" --format json\n```\n\n# Limitations\n\n## Jira JQL search limited to 100 results\nThe Atlassian MCP server doesn't return pagination tokens for JQL search responses, so results are limited to 100 issues per query. For projects with more issues, use specific JQL filters:\n```bash\n# Filter by date range\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/jira.py search \"project=PROJ AND created >= -30d\"\n\n# Filter by status\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/jira.py search \"project=PROJ AND status='In Progress'\"\n\n# Filter by assignee\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/jira.py search \"project=PROJ AND assignee=currentUser()\"\n```\n\n## Confluence CQL search supports pagination\nConfluence search properly paginates through all results. Use `--all` flag with search:\n```bash\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/confluence.py search \"space=TEAM\" --all\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## \"Not authenticated\" error\nRun the login command shown in Setup above.\n\n## \"Token expired\" error\nRun the login command again to re-authenticate. OAuth tokens auto-refresh, but refresh tokens can expire after extended periods of inactivity.\n\n## \"No cloud ID\" error\nRe-authenticate by running the login command shown in Setup above.\n\n## \"Permission denied\" on write operations\nYour OAuth token may lack write permissions. Re-authenticate to get new permissions:\n```bash\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/auth.py login\n```\n\n## \"Transition not found\" error\nThe target status is not available from the current issue status. Use `transitions` command to see available options.\n\n## \"Required field missing\" or field validation errors\nProjects often have custom required fields (e.g., Story Points, Team). To discover required fields:\n```bash\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/jira.py fields PROJ --type Story\n```\nThen add the required fields using `--field`:\n```bash\nuv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/jira-confluence scripts/jira.py create PROJ --type Story --summary \"Title\" --field \"customfield_10001=5\"\n```\n"
