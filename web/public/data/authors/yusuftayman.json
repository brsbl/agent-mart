        "README.md": "# Playwright CLI Agents for Claude Code\n\nA production-ready set of **Claude Code agents** and **skills** that automate Playwright E2E test generation, debugging, and planning using the **Page Object Model** pattern.\n\nDrop these files into any project's `.claude/` directory and get an AI-powered E2E testing workflow — from exploring a live URL to generating robust, maintainable test suites.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest\nplaywright-cli --help\n```\n\nNote that you might need to force it to reclaim the `playwright-cli` binary from our older MCP package.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest --force\n```\n\n### Demo\n\n```\n> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.\n  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios.\n```\n\nYour agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed\nplaywright-cli type \"Buy groceries\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli type \"Water flowers\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli check e21\nplaywright-cli check e35\nplaywright-cli screenshot\n```\n\n### Skills-less operation\n\nPoint your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `playwright-cli --help` on its own:\n\n```\nTest the \"add todo\" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.\nCheck playwright-cli --help for available commands.\n```\n\n### Installing skills\n\nClaude Code, GitHub Copilot and others will let you install the Playwright skills into the agentic loop.\n\n**Plugin (recommended)**\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add microsoft/playwright-cli\n/plugin install playwright-cli\n```\n\n**Manual**\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/playwright-cli\ncurl -o .claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/playwright-cli/main/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## What's Inside\n\n```\n.claude-plugin/\n└── marketplace.json                     # Plugin marketplace catalog\n\nplugins/\n└── playwright-cli-agents/\n    ├── .claude-plugin/\n    │   └── plugin.json                  # Plugin manifest\n    ├── agents/                          # Specialized subagents\n    │   ├── playwright-cli-planner.md    # Explores pages → creates test plans\n    │   ├── playwright-cli-generator.md  # Executes plans → writes test code\n    │   └── playwright-cli-healer.md     # Debugs & fixes failing tests\n    └── skills/\n        ├── playwright-cli/              # Browser automation via CLI\n        │   └── SKILL.md                 # playwright-cli command reference\n        └── e2e/                         # Shared domain knowledge\n            ├── SKILL.md                 # Core skill (auto-injected into agents)\n            ├── examples/\n            │   ├── page-object-model.md # Page Object class templates\n            │   └── e2e-tests.md         # Integration test patterns\n            └── references/\n                ├── component-exploration.md # How to explore UIs via playwright-cli\n                └── api-mocking.md       # Deterministic test data setup\n```\n\n## The Three Agents\n\n| Agent | Purpose | Trigger Example |\n|-------|---------|-----------------|\n| **Planner** | Navigates to a URL, explores interactive elements, and produces a structured test plan | *\"Create a test plan for our checkout flow at localhost:3000/checkout\"* |\n| **Generator** | Takes a test plan (or creates one), drives the browser in real-time, and outputs Page Object + spec files | *\"Generate Playwright tests for the login page\"* |\n| **Healer** | Runs failing tests, inspects the DOM, console, and network, then fixes broken locators/timing | *\"The dashboard test is failing after the redesign, fix it\"* |\n\n### How They Work Together\n\n```\n You describe what to test\n          │\n          ▼\n   ┌─────────────┐\n   │   Planner    │  Explores the page, identifies elements,\n   │   (green)    │  writes a markdown test plan\n   └──────┬──────┘\n          │ test plan\n          ▼\n   ┌─────────────┐\n   │  Generator   │  Drives browser via playwright-cli, records actions,\n   │   (blue)     │  generates Page Object + spec files\n   └──────┬──────┘\n          │ test files\n          ▼\n   ┌─────────────┐\n   │   Healer     │  Runs tests, catches failures,\n   │   (red)      │  auto-fixes locators & timing\n   └─────────────┘\n```\n\n## The E2E Skill\n\nThe `e2e` skill is **shared domain knowledge** that all three agents preload via the `skills: [e2e, playwright-cli]` frontmatter field. It defines:\n\n- **Test file structure** — where Page Objects, specs, and constants go\n- **Visual testing conventions** — component-level screenshots with `@visual` tag\n- **API mocking patterns** — deterministic data via `mockApi` utility\n- **Locator strategy** — role-based > data-attribute > CSS selector\n- **Anti-patterns** — no `waitForTimeout`, no full-page screenshots, no fixture files\n\n## Generated Test Structure\n\n```\n__tests__/\n├── e2e/\n│   ├── pages/                # Page Object classes\n│   │   └── login-page.ts     #   All locators + interaction methods\n│   └── login.spec.ts         # Test specs using Page Objects\n└── constants/\n    └── test-data.ts          # Reusable data values only\n```\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```typescript\n// __tests__/e2e/pages/login-page.ts\nexport class LoginPage {\n  readonly page: Page;\n  readonly emailInput: Locator;\n  readonly passwordInput: Locator;\n  readonly loginButton: Locator;\n\n  constructor(page: Page) {\n    this.page = page;\n    this.emailInput = page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' });\n    this.passwordInput = page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Password' });\n    this.loginButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' });\n  }\n\n  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<void> {\n    await this.emailInput.waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\n    await this.emailInput.fill(email);\n    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);\n    await this.loginButton.click();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```typescript\n// __tests__/e2e/login.spec.ts\ntest.describe('User Login', () => {\n  test('Valid Login @visual', async ({ page }) => {\n    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);\n    await loginPage.goto();\n    await loginPage.login(TEST_DATA.USER.EMAIL, TEST_DATA.USER.PASSWORD);\n    await loginPage.waitForDashboard();\n    await expect(loginPage.userName.locator('..')).toHaveScreenshot('dashboard-loaded.png');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI installed\n- [playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) — install globally:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Plugin Marketplace (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add yusuftayman/playwright-cli-agents\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install playwright-cli-agents@playwright-cli-agents\n```\n\n### Option 2: Copy into your project\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/yusuftayman/playwright-cli-agents.git\n\n# Copy agents and skills into your project\ncp -r playwright-cli-agents/plugins/playwright-cli-agents/agents/* your-project/.claude/agents/\ncp -r playwright-cli-agents/plugins/playwright-cli-agents/skills/* your-project/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code automatically delegates to these agents based on your request:\n\n```\nYou: \"Create a test plan for https://myapp.com/settings\"\n→ Claude spawns the Planner agent\n\nYou: \"Generate Playwright tests for the user profile page\"\n→ Claude spawns the Generator agent\n\nYou: \"The checkout test is failing, fix it\"\n→ Claude spawns the Healer agent\n```\n\nYou can also invoke agents directly:\n\n```\nYou: \"Use the playwright-cli-planner agent to explore https://myapp.com/dashboard\"\n```\n\n## Customization\n\n### Adapt to your project\n\n1. **Test structure** — Update paths in `SKILL.md` if your tests live somewhere other than `__tests__/e2e/`\n2. **Visual testing** — Adjust `maxDiffPixels` threshold in the skill docs to match your `playwright.config.ts`\n3. **API mocking** — Update the `mockApi` import paths and `API_ENDPOINTS` references to match your project\n\n### Add new agents\n\nCreate a new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` with this template:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-agent-name\ndescription: When to use this agent...\ntools: Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Bash\nmodel: sonnet\ncolor: purple\nskills:\n  - e2e\n  - playwright-cli\n---\n\nYour agent instructions here...\n```\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n| Decision | Rationale |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **playwright-cli over MCP** | CLI commands are more token-efficient; no large tool schemas loaded into context |\n| **Page Object Model** | Separates locators from test logic; one place to update when UI changes |\n| **Component-level screenshots** | More stable than full-page; failures are meaningful and diffs are readable |\n| **No `waitForTimeout`** | Hard-coded delays are flaky; `waitFor` conditions are deterministic |\n| **Skills preloaded via frontmatter** | Agents get domain knowledge at startup without wasting turns reading files |\n| **No helpers/fixtures folders** | All logic in Page Objects keeps the architecture simple and discoverable |\n| **`@visual` tag convention** | Enables `--grep @visual` to run/update only visual tests separately |\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- [playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) — Token-efficient CLI for browser automation by coding agents\n- [playwright-skill](https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill) — General-purpose Playwright automation as a Claude Code skill\n- [claude-code-showcase](https://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase) — Comprehensive Claude Code configuration example\n- [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) — Battle-tested Claude Code configs from an Anthropic hackathon winner\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
