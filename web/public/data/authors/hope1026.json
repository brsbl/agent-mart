Turn a simple idea into a playable game.\n\n> **Tip**: Ask \"Make a plan first\", review it, then say \"Execute it\" for better results.\n\n### Create and Place Objects\n\nSay \"Make a red brick house\" or \"Plant 10 trees in a row\" and AI creates them directly in Roblox Studio. Create one object or hundreds at once.\n\n### Write and Modify Scripts\n\nAsk \"Make particles appear when players jump\" or \"Find the bug in this script\" and AI writes and fixes code for you. It analyzes existing scripts and understands dependencies too.\n\n### Set Scene Atmosphere\n\nJust say \"Change to sunset vibes\" or \"Make it dark like a rainy day\" and AI automatically adjusts lighting, sky, and fog.\n\n### Generate Terrain\n\nCreate natural landscapes like mountains, rivers, plains, and caves through conversation. Customize materials, colors, and sizes freely.\n\n### Search and Insert Assets\n\nSearch the Creator Store for free models and assets, then add them to your game instantly. Just say \"Find a medieval castle model and insert it\".\n\n### Spatial Analysis and Placement\n\nAI handles spatial tasks like \"Find empty space in this area\" or \"Analyze where monsters can walk\".\n\n### Debugging and Analysis\n\nCheck game error logs, find problems, and fix them together with AI.\n\n> [View all features](docs/en/tools/overview.md)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstallation is complete in two steps:\n\n1. **Install Roblox Studio Plugin** — Acts as a bridge between Studio and AI\n2. **Register MCP Server with AI App** — Configure your AI app to recognize Roblox MCP\n\nTakes just 5 minutes. 👉 [View Installation Guide](docs/en/installation/README.md)\n\n## Links\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/hope1026/roblox-mcp)\n- [Issue Reports](https://github.com/hope1026/roblox-mcp/issues)\n"
