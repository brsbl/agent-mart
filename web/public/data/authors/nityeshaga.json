It beats PhDs, aces entrance exams in every field, and this gap will only widen.\n\nIn this world, humans have two paths: let their cognitive capabilities decline, or rise to match AI. The long-term future of humanity depends heavily on which path we take.\n\nMy belief is simple: today's AI is smarter than any private tutor anyone on the planet can hire. So why not use it to give every human access to the best personal tutor imaginable? One that knows your background, adapts to your pace, uses your actual work as teaching material, and helps you retain what you learn.\n\nThis project starts with programming - the domain where AI has the most immediate economic impact. Use it to learn about the programs you're vibe coding and level up your skills. Don't just vibe code, vibe learn.\n\n## Install - Claude Code\n\n### Step 1: Install the Plugin\n\n1.

        "plugins/safe-push/README.md": "# Safe Push\n\nPrevents accidental pushes to main branch in Claude Code bypassPermissions mode.\n\n## The Vulnerability\n\nWhen Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, it can execute git commands without user approval. This creates a security gap when this plugin is **not installed at the user level**.\n\n**Example scenario:**\n\n1. **Repo A** has the `basics` plugin installed at project level - you think it's protected\n2. **Repo B** has no plugin installed\n3. Claude Code runs inside **Repo B**\n4. Claude can push to Repo A's main branch using the `-C` flag:\n   ```bash\n   git -C /path/to/RepoA push origin main\n   ```\n5. Repo A's project-level `basics` plugin **does not help** - hooks only run in the context of where Claude is running (Repo B)\n\n**The key insight:** Protection depends on where Claude runs, not on the target repository. A repo cannot protect itself from external `-C` commands. The only way to protect all your repositories is to install this plugin at the **user level**.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Important:** This plugin must be installed at the **user level** to protect all repositories.\n\nAdd to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"https://github.com/nityeshaga/claude-code-essentials/tree/main/plugins/safe-push\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOr using the CLI:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin add https://github.com/nityeshaga/claude-code-essentials/tree/main/plugins/safe-push\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe plugin installs a `PreToolUse` hook that intercepts all Bash commands. When a `git push` command is detected, the hook:\n\n1. Parses the command to extract git subcommand and arguments\n2. Blocks explicit pushes to `main` (e.g., `git push origin main`)\n3. Blocks implicit pushes when on `main` branch (e.g., `git push`)\n4. Blocks `--all` and `--mirror` pushes that would include main\n\nThe hook handles all variations including:\n- Direct pushes: `git push origin main`\n- Refspec pushes: `git push origin HEAD:main`\n- Flag variations: `git push -u origin main`\n- Cross-repo pushes: `git -C /other/repo push origin main`\n\n## Hooks\n\n| Hook | Event | Description |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| `block-main-push` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks git pushes to main branch |\n\n## Related: basics Plugin\n\nThe same `block-main-push` hook is also included in the [basics plugin](../basics/README.md). Use:\n\n- **safe-push** (this plugin): For **user-level** installation to protect local development\n- **basics**: For **project-level** installation in CI/CD environments (e.g., GitHub Actions)\n\nIf you have `basics` installed at project level, you don't need `safe-push` for that specific project. However, installing `safe-push` at user level ensures protection across **all** your repositories.\n"
