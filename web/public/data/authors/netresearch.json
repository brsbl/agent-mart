Claude Code fetches plugins directly from their source repositories when installed.\n\n```\nmarketplace.json (this repo)\n    ↓\nClaude Code reads catalog\n    ↓\nUser installs plugin\n    ↓\nClaude Code fetches from source repo (e.g., netresearch/typo3-docs-skill)\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Single source of truth - each plugin in its own repository\n- No sync workflows needed\n- Always fetches latest from source\n- Simple maintenance\n\n## Adding a Plugin\n\nTo add a new plugin to this marketplace, add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\",\n  \"description\": \"Plugin description\",\n  \"source\": {\n    \"source\": \"github\",\n    \"repo\": \"netresearch/my-plugin-repo\"\n  },\n  \"category\": \"development\"\n}\n```\n\n## Internal Marketplace\n\nNetresearch also maintains an internal marketplace for proprietary skills:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add git@git.netresearch.de:coding-ai/marketplace.git\n```\n\n---\n\n**Maintained by:** [Netresearch DTT GmbH](https://www.netresearch.de), Leipzig\n"
