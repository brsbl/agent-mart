Option 1: Install ALL Skills (Bundle)\n\nGet all 23 skills at once with intelligent routing:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add jamesrochabrun/skills\n/plugin install all-skills@skills-marketplace\n```\n\n**When to use this:**\n- You want access to all skills\n- You prefer Claude to automatically choose relevant skills\n- You work across multiple domains (engineering, product, design, etc.)\n\n### Option 2: Install Individual Skills\n\nPick only the skills you need for better performance and focused context:\n\n```bash\n# First, add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add jamesrochabrun/skills\n\n# Then install specific skills\n/plugin install anthropic-architect@skills-marketplace\n/plugin install prd-generator@skills-marketplace\n/plugin install frontend-designer@skills-marketplace\n# ... install any skills you need\n```\n\n**When to use this:**\n- You work in specific domains\n- You want optimal performance with smaller context\n- You prefer explicit skill activation\n\n### Available Individual Skills\n\n**AI & Architecture:**\n- `/plugin install anthropic-architect@skills-marketplace`\n- `/plugin install anthropic-prompt-engineer@skills-marketplace`\n\n**Engineering:**\n- `/plugin install openai-prompt-engineer@skills-marketplace`\n- `/plugin

`/plugin install swiftui-animation@skills-marketplace`\n- `/plugin install releasing-macos-apps@skills-marketplace`\n\n### Plugin Structure\n\nThe plugin follows the standard Claude Code plugin architecture:\n\n```\nskills/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata\n│   └── marketplace.json     # Marketplace configuration (25 plugins: 1 bundle + 24 individual)\n├── skills/                   # All skills collection (24 total)\n│   ├── anthropic-architect/\n│   ├── anthropic-prompt-engineer/\n│   ├── openai-prompt-engineer/\n│   ├── git-worktrees/\n│   ├──

      # This file\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n**Marketplace Configuration:**\n- The `marketplace.json` exposes 25 installable options\n- 1 \"all-skills\" bundle with `strict: false` (intelligent routing across all 24 skills)\n- 24 individual skills with `strict: true` (explicit activation when installed)\n\n**Installation Flexibility:**\n- Install the bundle for comprehensive coverage with smart skill selection\n- Install individual skills for focused, high-performance context\n- Mix and match based on your needs\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code\n- Skills may have their own dependencies (check individual skill README)\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to contribute additional skills or improvements via pull requests.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - See individual skills for their specific licenses.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThis marketplace provides flexible installation options:\n\n### Bundle Installation (all-skills)\n- **What:** All 23 skills in one package\n- **Behavior:** `strict: false` enables intelligent skill routing\n- **Best for:** Users who work across multiple domains and want comprehensive coverage\n- **Trade-off:** Larger context window, but Claude automatically selects relevant skills\n\n### Individual Installation\n- **What:** Install only specific skills you need\n- **Behavior:** `strict: true` ensures explicit skill activation\n- **Best for:** Focused workflows in specific domains (e.g., only engineering or only design)\n- **Trade-off:** Smaller context window for better performance, but requires manual skill selection\n\n### Technical Details\n\n**marketplace.json structure:**\n- 24 total plugin entries\n- 1 \"all-skills\" bundle pointing to root with all 23 skills\n- 23 individual plugins, each pointing to a single skill\n- All use same repository source (`./`) with different skill paths\n\n**Why this works:**\n- No duplication: Skills live in one place (`skills/` directory)\n- Flexible installation: Users choose bundle vs individual\n- No maintenance burden: No individual `plugin.json` files needed\n- Clean architecture: Single source of truth in `marketplace.json`\n\nFor more information about Claude
