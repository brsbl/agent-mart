        "README.md": "# Hyperpowers\n\nStrong guidance for Claude Code as a software development assistant.\n\nHyperpowers is a Claude Code plugin that provides structured workflows, best practices, and specialized agents to help you build software more effectively. Think of it as a pair programming partner that ensures you follow proven development patterns.\n\n## Features\n\n### Skills\n\nReusable workflows for common development tasks:\n\n**Feature Development:**\n- **brainstorming** - Interactive design refinement using Socratic method\n- **writing-plans** - Create detailed implementation plans (single task or multiple tasks)\n- **executing-plans** - Execute tasks continuously with optional per-task review\n- **review-implementation** - Verify implementation matches requirements\n- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete workflow for PR creation and cleanup\n- **sre-task-refinement** - Ensure all corner cases and requirements are understood (uses Opus 4.1)\n\n**Bug Fixing & Debugging:**\n- **debugging-with-tools** - Systematic investigation using debuggers, internet research, and agents\n- **root-cause-tracing** - Trace backward through call stack to find original trigger\n- **fixing-bugs** - Complete workflow from bug discovery to closure with bd tracking\n\n**Refactoring & Maintenance:**\n- **refactoring-diagnosis** - Identify code/design smells and refactor targets\n- **refactoring-design** - Create refactor design with composition, DI, and test strategy\n- **refactoring-safely** - Test-preserving transformations in small steps with tests staying green\n\n**Quality & Testing:**\n- **test-driven-development** - Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement\n- **testing-anti-patterns** - Prevent common testing mistakes\n- **verification-before-completion** - Always verify before claiming success\n\n**Task & Project Management:**\n- **managing-bd-tasks** - Advanced bd operations: splitting tasks, merging duplicates, dependencies, metrics\n\n**Collaboration & Process:**\n- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Investigate independent failures concurrently\n- **writing-skills** - TDD for process documentation itself\n\n**Infrastructure & Customization:**\n- **building-hooks** - Create custom hooks for automating quality checks and workflow enhancements\n- **skills-auto-activation** - Solve skills not activating reliably through better descriptions or custom hooks\n\n### Slash Commands\n\nQuick access to key workflows:\n\n- `/hyperpowers:brainstorm` - Start interactive design refinement\n- `/hyperpowers:write-plan` - Create detailed implementation plan\n- `/hyperpowers:execute-plan` - Execute plan with review checkpoints\n- `/hyperpowers:review-implementation` - Review completed implementation\n- `/hyperpowers:refactor-diagnose` - Diagnose code/design smells and refactor targets\n- `/hyperpowers:refactor-design` - Design refactor with composition, DI, and test strategy\n- `/hyperpowers:refactor-execute` - Execute refactor safely with tests staying green\n\n### Specialized Agents\n\nDomain-specific agents for complex tasks:\n\n- **code-reviewer** - Review implementations against plans and coding standards\n- **codebase-investigator** - Understand current codebase state and patterns\n- **internet-researcher** - Research APIs, libraries, and current best practices\n- **test-runner** - Run tests/pre-commit hooks/commits without context pollution (uses Haiku)\n\n### Hooks System\n\nIntelligent hooks that provide context-aware assistance:\n\n**Automatic Skill Activation** - The UserPromptSubmit hook analyzes your prompts and suggests relevant skills before Claude responds. Simply type what you want to do, and you'll get skill recommendations if applicable.\n\n**Context Tracking** - The PostToolUse hook tracks file edits during your session, maintaining context for intelligent reminders.\n\n**Gentle Reminders** - The Stop hook provides helpful reminders after Claude responds:\n- 💭 TDD reminder when editing source without tests\n- ✅ Verification reminder when claiming completion\n- 💾 Commit reminder after multiple file edits\n\nSee [HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md) for configuration, troubleshooting, and customization details.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n### Context Efficiency with test-runner Agent\n\nThe **test-runner** agent solves a common problem: running tests, pre-commit hooks, or git commits can generate massive amounts of output that pollutes your context window with successful test results, formatting changes, and debug prints.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Agent runs commands in its own separate context\n- Captures all output (test results, hook output, etc.)\n- Returns **only**: summary statistics + complete failure details\n- Filters out: passing test output, \"Reformatted X files\" spam, verbose formatting diffs\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\n# Without agent: Your context gets 500 lines of passing test output\npytest tests/  # 47 tests pass, prints everything\n\n# With test-runner agent: Your context gets clean summary\nTask(\"Run tests\", \"Run pytest tests/\")\n# Agent returns: \"✓ 47 tests passed, 0 failed. Exit code 0.\"\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Keeps your context clean and focused\n- Still provides complete failure details when tests fail\n- Works with all test frameworks (pytest, cargo, npm, go)\n- Handles pre-commit hooks without formatting spam\n- Provides verification evidence for verification-before-completion skill\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from the Claude Code plugin marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add withzombies/hyperpowers\n/plugin install hyperpowers@hyperpowers\n```\n\nVerify installation by running `/help` - you should see the hyperpowers slash commands listed.\n\nTo update the plugin later:\n\n```\n/plugin update hyperpowers\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe `using-hyper` skill automatically loads at the start of each conversation and establishes core workflows. It ensures you:\n\n1. Check for relevant skills before starting any task\n2. Follow mandatory workflows (brainstorming before coding, TDD, verification)\n3. Use TodoWrite for tracking checklist items\n4. Announce which skills you're using\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n```\nUser: I need to add user authentication to my app\n\nClaude: I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your authentication requirements.\n\n[Socratic questioning to understand requirements]\n\nClaude: Now I'm using the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan.\n\n[Creates detailed plan with specific tasks in bd]\n\nClaude: I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement the tasks.\n\n[Works through ready tasks continuously, using bd ready to find next task]\n\nClaude: I'm using the test-runner agent to verify all tests pass.\n\n[Agent runs tests, reports: \"✓ 47 tests passed, 0 failed\"]\n\nClaude: I'm using the review-implementation skill to verify everything works.\n\n[Reviews implementation against requirements]\n\nClaude: I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to wrap up.\n\n[Creates PR, cleans up]\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\nHyperpowers embodies several core principles:\n\n- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests\n- **Learning from existing code** - Study patterns before implementing\n- **Explicit workflows over implicit assumptions** - Make the process visible\n- **Verification before completion** - Evidence over assertions\n- **Test-driven when possible** - Red, green, refactor\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! This plugin is inspired by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).\n\n### Adding New Skills\n\n1. Create a new directory in `skills/`\n2. Add a `skill.md` file with the workflow\n3. Follow the TDD approach in `writing-skills` skill\n4. Test with subagents before deployment\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\nRyan Stortz (ryan@withzombies.com)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nInspired by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) - a strong foundation for structured development workflows\n"
