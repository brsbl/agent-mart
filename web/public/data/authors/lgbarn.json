See [`docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md`](docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation including model assignments, tool access, and composition patterns.\n\n## Agent Teams Support\n\nShipyard now supports [Claude Code Agent Teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — an experimental feature where multiple independent Claude Code instances collaborate on the same project by sharing a task list and mailbox.\n\n### How It Works\n\nShipyard's standard execution model uses **subagents** (the Task tool) to dispatch builders, reviewers, and other agents. Each subagent runs within the lead agent's session, sharing its working directory but with a fresh context window. This is efficient for coordinated work where the lead needs to collect results and make decisions.\n\n**Agent Teams** introduces a different model: independent Claude Code instances (teammates) that each have their own full session, context window, and tool access. They coordinate through a shared task list and mailbox rather than through a parent-child relationship.\n\nShipyard detects the teams environment automatically — **no configuration needed:**\n\n| Environment Variable | Set By | Meaning |\n|---------------------|--------|---------|\n| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` | You (opt-in) | Enables the teams feature in Claude Code |\n| `CLAUDE_CODE_TEAM_NAME` | Claude Code (automatic) | Identifies this instance as a teammate |\n\nWhen teams are detected, Shipyard adapts its behavior:\n\n| Behavior | Solo Mode (default) | Teammate Mode |\n|----------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Task execution | Dispatches builder subagents | Executes tasks directly (you ARE the builder) |\n| Quality gates | Lead dispatches auditor/simplifier | Lead handles quality gates; teammates skip |\n| State updates | Writes STATE.json directly | Reports via task metadata (lead writes state) |\n| State file locking | No locking needed | mkdir-based locking prevents concurrent writes |\n| Verification | Standard pipeline | Runs locally, reports via task metadata |\n| Stopping work | No gates | `TeammateIdle` hook verifies tests pass first |\n| Completing tasks | No gates | `TaskCompleted` hook verifies evidence exists |\n\n### Enabling Agent Teams\n\n1. **Enable the experimental feature** in your Claude Code configuration:\n   ```bash\n   export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Claude Code normally.** When Claude Code spawns teammates, Shipyard automatically detects the team environment and adapts.\n\n3. **Solo users are completely unaffected.** If you don't set the environment variable, Shipyard behaves exactly as before — no locking, no hooks, no behavioral changes.\n\n### When to Use Teams vs Subagents\n\n- **Use subagents** (Shipyard's default) when tasks are tightly coordinated, results need to flow back to a lead agent, or when you want the standard build pipeline (builder → reviewer → auditor).\n- **Use teams** when tasks are truly independent, each takes significant time, and you want full isolation between workers to prevent context cross-contamination.\n\nTeams and subagents are complementary. A lead agent in a team can still dispatch subagents for tightly-coupled subtasks within its assigned work.\n\nSee [docs/AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md](docs/AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md) for the full Agent Teams usage guide.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### The Lifecycle\n\n```\nIDEA → /init (configure preferences)\n     → /brainstorm (explore requirements)\n     → /plan (research + decompose)\n     → /build (parallel execute + review)\n     → repeat plan→build per phase\n     → /ship (verify + deliver)\n     → SHIPPED\n```\n\n### State Management\n\nShipyard uses a dual state system:\n\n- **File state** (`.shipyard/` directory): Cross-session persistence for project vision, roadmap, plans, and progress. Survives session restarts and can be committed to git. Includes backup-on-write (`.bak`), SHA-256 checksums, and working notes (`NOTES.md`) for compaction resilience.\n- **Native tasks** (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate): In-session UI visibility showing real-time progress of phases and plans.\n\n### Key Design Principles\n\n- **Fresh context per task**: Each builder agent runs in a clean 200k-token context, preventing quality degradation\n- **Two-stage review + security audit**: Spec compliance and code quality per task, comprehensive security audit per phase\n- **Configurable gates**: Security audit, simplification review, and IaC validation can be toggled in `config.json` or skipped with `--light`. Hook kill switch (`SHIPYARD_DISABLE_HOOKS`) available for debugging\n- **Code simplification**: Post-phase analysis catches AI-generated duplication and bloat across tasks\n- **Documentation generation**: Post-phase documentation keeps docs synchronized with code changes\n- **IaC support**: Terraform, Ansible, Docker validation workflows built into the builder and verifier\n- **Max 3 tasks per plan**: Keeps each agent's workload within the quality budget\n- **Atomic commits**: Every task produces a separate, revertable commit\n- **Phase-based planning**: Break large projects into manageable phases with clear success criteria\n\n## Project State Structure\n\n```\n.shipyard/\n├── PROJECT.md          #

Teammate detection uses `CLAUDE_CODE_TEAM_NAME` automatically.\n\nSee [docs/AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md](docs/AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md) for the full guide.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\nquantdev/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── marketplace.json\n│   └── plugin.json\n├── agents/                     # 11 agent dispatch prompts\n│   ├── architect.md\n│   ├── backtester.md\n│   ├── builder.md\n│   ├── cross-platform-validator.md\n│   ├── debugger.md\n│   ├── documenter.md\n│   ├── optimizer.md\n│   ├── researcher.md\n│   ├── reviewer.md\n│   ├── risk-analyst.md\n│   └── verifier.md\n├── commands/                   # 22 slash command definitions\n│   ├── backtest.md\n│   ├── bot.md\n│   ├── debug.md\n│   ├── deploy.md\n│   ├── doctor.md\n│   ├── help.md\n│   ├── indicator.md\n│   ├── init.md\n│   ├── map.md\n│   ├── optimize.md\n│   ├── port.md\n│   ├── q.md\n│   ├── quick.md\n│   ├── recover.md\n│   ├── research.md\n│   ├── resume.md\n│   ├── review.md\n│   ├── risk.md\n│   ├── rollback.md\n│   ├── s.md\n│   ├── status.md\n│   └── validate.md\n├── skills/                     # 13 auto-activating skills\n│   ├── backtest-integrity/\n│   ├── cross-platform-consistency/\n│   ├── documentation/\n│   ├── git-workflow/\n│   ├── lessons-learned/\n│   ├── lookahead-guard/\n│   ├── parallel-dispatch/\n│   ├── quantdev-debugging/\n│   ├── quantdev-tdd/\n│   ├── quantdev-verification/\n│   ├── regime-awareness/\n│   ├── risk-discipline/\n│   └── using-quantdev/\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── hooks.json              # 5 hooks: SessionStart, TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted, Stop\n│   ├── teammate-idle.sh\n│   ├── task-completed.sh\n│   └── stop.sh\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── state-read.sh\n│   ├── state-write.sh\n│   ├── team-detect.sh\n│   ├── checkpoint.sh\n│   ├── check-versions.sh\n│   └── marketplace-sync.sh\n├── test/                       # bats test suite\n├── docs/\n│   ├── AGENT-GUIDE.md\n│   ├── AGENT-TEAMS-GUIDE.md\n│   ├── PROTOCOLS.md\n│   └── QUICKSTART.md\n├── CHANGELOG.md\n├── LICENSE\n├── README.md\n└── package.json\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
