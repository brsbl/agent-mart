        "README.md": "# AI Helpers\n\nThis repository is a collaborative place hosting collections of AI plugins to automate and assist with various tasks.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Right now the focus is to support Claude Code, OpenCode.ai, Gemini Gems, and Cursor AI.\n> Other tools are welcome here, please submit Pull Requests.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This project was inspired by the [OpenShift AI helpers](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers).\n\n## Got an Idea?\n\nHave an idea for a new plugin, command, or assistant but not sure how to implement it? We'd love to hear about it!\nSimply file a GitHub issue with your idea in the title and we'll work together to make it happen.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> [Share your idea](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-helpers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Chelp+wanted%2Cidea&template=07_idea_request.md&title=%5BIdea%5D+)\n\nNo implementation details needed - just describe what you'd like to automate or what workflow you think could be\nimproved. The community can help figure out the best way to build it.\n\n## Tools Development\n\nThis repository is made for collaboration. We highly welcome contributions.\n\nFor skills, check out the `helpers/skills/` directory for examples.\nFor commands, check the `helpers/commands/` directory, and for agents see the `helpers/agents/` directory.\nUsing AI code assistant itself to develop the tools is highly encouraged.\n\n### Adding New Tools\n\nWhen contributing new tools:\n\n1. **Skills**: Add to the `helpers/skills/` directory following the agentskills.io format\n2. **Commands**: Add to the `helpers/commands/` directory as Markdown files\n3. **Agents**: Add to the `helpers/agents/` directory with appropriate documentation\n4. **Gemini Gems**: Add to the `helpers/gems/` directory\n\nOnce you have added the tool, you'd have to run have to run `make update` in order to generate the website data.\nThen you should git commit your change and after than running `make lint` would run local tests to validate the syntax.\n\n### Testing a plugin locally (example with Claude Code)\n\n1. Open `claude`\n2. Run `/plugin marketplace add ./`\n3. Run `/plugin` then install the local plugin\n4. Test plugin and remove local marketplace after done testing which will remove plugin\n5. You can now reinstall from the git marketplace\n\n## Tool Registry\n\nThe AI Helpers marketplace uses a centralized category registry in `categories.yaml` to organize specialized tools by category. **Tools not listed in any category are automatically placed in the \"General\" category** - perfect for most contributions!\n\n### Category Registry Structure\n\nSpecialized tool categories are registered in `categories.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nCategoryName:\n  - specialized-tool\n  - another-tool\n\nAnotherCategory:\n  - domain-specific-tool\n```\n\n### Adding a New Category\n\nTo add a new category, edit `categories.yaml` to include the new category as a top-level key:\n\n1. **Add category with tools**:\n   ```yaml\n   YourCategory:\n     - your-tool-name\n     - another-tool\n   ```\n\n2. **Update documentation**: Run `make update` to regenerate the website\n\n### Automatic Management\n\nThe build system automatically handles tool organization and validation:\n- Tools not in `categories.yaml` are automatically assigned to \"General\" category\n- Tool types are inferred from filesystem structure\n- Duplicate tool names across categories are prevented\n- All tools require valid names and types\n\n\n## Using with Claude Code\n\nClaude Code Marketplace extends Claude's functionality with custom commands, agents, and skills for specific workflows and\ntasks.\nThey enable you to automate repetitive development activities, integrate with tools, and create specialized AI\nassistants tailored to your needs.\n\nFor comprehensive information about plugin architecture and development, see\nthe [official Claude Code plugins documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins-reference).\n\n### Install the tools from the Marketplace\n\n1. **Add the marketplace:**\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add opendatahub-io/ai-helpers\n   ```\n\n\n2. **Install a plugin:**\n   ```bash\n   /plugin install odh-ai-helpers\n   ```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> To browse and install multiple plugins interactively, use `/plugin` after adding the marketplace.\n> This will show you all available plugins and allow you to install them selectively.\n> For a complete list of all available tools, see **[categories.yaml](categories.yaml)** or visit our [website](https://opendatahub-io.github.io/ai-helpers/).\n\n3. **Use the commands:**\n   ```bash\n   /hello-world:echo Hello from OpenDataHub!\n   ```\n\n### Running Claude Code in a Container\n\nFor IDE users, we have supplied a devcontainer.json file. For setup and prerequisites, see [Dev Container README](.devcontainer/README.md).\n\nFor setup with the standard CLI see the following. \n\nA container image is available with Claude Code and all plugins pre-installed:\n`ghcr.io/opendatahub-io/ai-helpers:latest`\n\nYou can also build it yourself by running:\n\n```bash\npodman build -f images/claude/Containerfile -t ai-helpers .\n```\n\nTo use Claude Code with Google Cloud's Vertex AI, you need to pass through your gcloud credentials and set the required\nenvironment variables:\n\n```bash\npodman run -it --rm \\\n  --pull newer \\\n  --userns=keep-id \\\n  -e CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 \\\n  -e CLOUD_ML_REGION=your-ml-region \\\n  -e ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id \\\n  -e DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 \\\n  -v ~/.config/gcloud:/home/claude/.config/gcloud:ro,z \\\n  -v ~/.claude:/home/claude/.claude:z \\\n  -v ~/.claude.json:/home/claude/.claude.json:z \\\n  -v $(pwd):$(pwd):z \\\n  -w $(pwd) \\\n  ghcr.io/opendatahub-io/ai-helpers:latest\n```\n\nYou can execute Claude Code commands directly without entering an interactive session using the `-p` or `--print` flag.\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n\n- `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` - Enable Vertex AI integration\n- `CLOUD_ML_REGION` - Your GCP region (e.g., `us-east5`)\n- `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` - Your GCP project ID\n\n**Rootless Podman:**\n\n- `--userns=keep-id` - Preserves host user ID mapping, required for the claude user to access mounted volumes\n\n**Volume Mounts:**\n\n- `-v ~/.claude:/home/claude/.claude:z` - Mounts your local Claude sessions and project data\n- `-v ~/.claude.json:/home/claude/.claude.json:z` - Mounts your user configuration (onboarding state, preferences)\n- `-v $(pwd):$(pwd):z` - Mounts the project at the same absolute path as on the host to reuse Claude's session data\n- `-w $(pwd)` - Sets the working directory to match the host path\n\nAdd this to your `~/.bashrc` for easy launching of the container:\n\n```bash\nclaude-container() {\n  podman run -it --rm \\\n    --pull newer \\\n    --userns=keep-id \\\n    -e CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 \\\n    -e CLOUD_ML_REGION=\"${CLOUD_ML_REGION}\" \\\n    -e ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=\"${ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID}\" \\\n    -e DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 \\\n    -v ~/.config/gcloud:/home/claude/.config/gcloud:ro,z \\\n    -v ~/.claude:/home/claude/.claude:z \\\n    -v ~/.claude.json:/home/claude/.claude.json:z \\\n    -v \"$(pwd):$(pwd):z\" \\\n    -w \"$(pwd)\" \\\n    ghcr.io/opendatahub-io/ai-helpers:latest \"$@\"\n}\n```\n\n## Using with OpenCode.ai\n\n[OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai) is an open-source AI coding assistant that supports custom skills and commands. Our helpers can be integrated as OpenCode skills and commands to enhance your development workflow.\n\n**Note**: OpenCode.ai agents are not currently compatible due to format differences. Only skills and commands are supported at this time.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Clone the helpers repository:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-helpers.git\n   cd ai-helpers\n   ```\n\n2. **Install globally:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills ~/.config/opencode/commands\n   ln -sf $(pwd)/helpers/skills/* ~/.config/opencode/skills/\n   ln -sf $(pwd)/helpers/commands/* ~/.config/opencode/commands/\n   ```\n\nThese helpers are available when loading the odh-ai-helpers plugin from the marketplace as instructed above.\n\n## Gemini Gems\n\nThe `helpers/gems/` directory contains a curated collection of Gemini Gems - specialized AI assistants for various\ndevelopment tasks. These can be accessed directly through Google's Gemini platform.\n\nFor detailed information about using and contributing Gemini Gems, see [helpers/gems/README.md](helpers/gems/README.md).\n\n## Validating Tools\n\nThis repository uses [claudelint](https://github.com/stbenjam/claudelint) to validate the Claude plugin structure:\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\n## Ethical Guidelines\n\nWe must NEVER reference real people by name, even as stylistic examples (e.g., \"in the\nstyle of 'specific human'\").\n\n**Ethical rationale:**\n\n1. **Consent**: Individuals have not consented to have their identity or persona used in AI-generated content\n2. **Misrepresentation**: AI cannot accurately replicate a person's unique voice, style, or intent\n3. **Intellectual Property**: A person's distinctive style may be protected\n4. **Dignity**: Using someone's identity without permission diminishes their autonomy\n\n**Instead, describe specific qualities explicitly**\n\nGood examples:\n\n* \"Write commit messages that are direct, technically precise, and focused on the rationale behind changes\"\n* \"Explain using clear analogies, a sense of wonder, and accessible language for non-experts\"\n* \"Code review comments that are encouraging, constructive, and focus on collaborative improvement\"\n\nWhen you identify a desirable characteristic (clarity, brevity, formality, humor, etc.), describe it explicitly rather\nthan using a person as proxy.\n\n## Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)\n\nFor additional validation, the repository includes `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Red Hat security and AI-readiness\nhooks:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\npre-commit install --hook-type pre-push\npre-commit run --all-files  # Test all files\n```\n\nThis automatically scans all tools and regenerates the complete documentation and website data.\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n",
