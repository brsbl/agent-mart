One command, no context switching.\n\n```bash\nrr run \"make test\"\n```\n\nYour project rsyncs to the remote, the command runs, and output streams back. Works from home, a coffee shop, or anywhere—rr figures out which connection works.\n\n## Contents\n\n-   [Why rr](#why-rr)\n-   [Features](#features)\n-   [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n-   [Install](#install)\n-   [Setup](#setup)\n-   [Usage](#usage)\n-   [Parallel execution](#parallel-execution)\n-   [Configuration](#configuration)\n-   [How It Works](#how-it-works)\n-   [Commands](#commands)\n-   [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n-   [Documentation](#documentation)\n-   [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Why rr\n\nI got tired of my laptop fan spinning up and battery draining every time I ran tests. I have a few beefy machines sitting in the corner doing nothing most of the time, so I wanted an easy way to sync code over and run heavy stuff on those instead.\n\n![Pi7_GIF_CMP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ffe029e-af38-4a77-8c77-156fae378db7)\n\n**Especially useful for agentic coding:** If you're doing TDD with Claude Code, Cursor, or similar tools, AI agents want to run tests constantly to verify their work. With multiple sub-agents running in parallel—or multiple features being developed simultaneously—your test suite gets hammered from all directions. `rr` queues test runs across your machine pool so agents aren't all fighting over localhost (and failing tests because they're stomping on each other).\n\n**The problem with existing tools:**\n\n| Tool           | Issue                                            |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `rsync && ssh` | Manual, repetitive, no connection failover       |\n| Ansible        | Requires inventory files, YAML playbooks, Python |\n| DevPod/Tilt    | Container-focused, overkill for \"sync + run\"     |\n| VS Code Remote | IDE-coupled, doesn't solve CLI workflows         |\n\nrr fills the gap: **a single binary that handles sync, execution, locking, load balancing, and connection failover**—nothing more.\n\n## Features\n\n-   **Parallel task execution** — Run multiple tasks across multiple hosts simultaneously with animated progress indicators\n-   **Smart connection failover** — Configure multiple SSH paths (LAN, Tailscale, backup host) and `rr` picks the first one that works\n-   **File sync with rsync** — Excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, etc. by default; preserves remote-only dirs like `.venv`\n-   **Distributed locking** — Prevents concurrent runs on shared machines; auto-detects and waits if someone else is working\n-   **Load balancing** — Single tasks are distributed across available hosts; parallel tasks use all hosts concurrently\n-   **Agentic coding friendly** — Queues parallel test runs from AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) across your machine pool\n-   **Claude Code skill** — Install the `rr` skill and let Claude set up your environment and troubleshoot issues\n-   **Named tasks** — Define `test`, `build`, `deploy` commands in config, run with `rr test`\n-   **Output formatters** — Auto-formats pytest, Jest, Go test, and Cargo output for readable failure summaries\n-   **Real-time monitor** — TUI dashboard showing CPU, RAM, GPU across all your hosts\n-   **Remote environment bootstrap** — Declare required tools with `require:`, rr verifies they exist before running\n-   **Zero dependencies** — Single Go binary, no runtime requirements\n-   **Works anywhere** — macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL)\n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install\nbrew install rileyhilliard/tap/rr    # or see Install section below\n\n# 2. Set up in your project\ncd your-project\nrr init                               # Creates .rr.yaml config\n\n# 3. Run something\nrr run \"make test\"                    # Syncs files + runs command\n```\n\nThat's the whole flow. `rr` syncs your code to the remote, runs the command, and streams output back.\n\n## Install\n\n**Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**\n\n```bash\nbrew install rileyhilliard/tap/rr\n```\n\n**Install script**\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rileyhilliard/rr/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n**Go install**\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/rileyhilliard/rr/cmd/rr@latest\n```\n\n**Manual download**\n\nGrab the binary for your platform from [releases](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/rr/releases).\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisite:** You need passwordless SSH access to your remote machine. If you can run `ssh user@yourhost` without entering a password, you're good. If not, see the [SSH setup guide](docs/ssh-setup.md).\n\n```bash\nrr init          # Creates .rr.yaml - interactive prompts walk you through it\nrr doctor        # Verifies everything works\n```\n\nIf `rr init` doesn't detect your SSH config, you can add hosts manually. See [configuration docs](docs/configuration.md).\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nrr run \"make test\"    # Sync files, then run command\nrr exec \"git status\"  # Run command without syncing (faster for quick checks)\nrr sync               # Just sync files, no command\n```\n\nYou can also define named tasks in your config:\n\n```yaml\ntasks:\n    test:\n        run: pytest -n auto\n    build:\n        run: make build\n```\n\nThen run them by name:\n\n```bash\nrr test                    # Same as: rr run \"pytest -n auto\"\nrr build\nrr test tests/test_api.py  # Pass extra args: pytest -n auto tests/test_api.py\nrr tasks                   # List all available tasks\n```\n\n![demo-tasks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d902e99-9b7a-4fa9-a2fa-bbdef8365e3b)\n\n## Parallel execution\n\n![parallel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d48195-f179-45b4-8fd3-739b88041049)\n\nRun multiple tasks across multiple hosts simultaneously. Define a parallel task that references other tasks, and `rr` distributes them across your machine pool with animated progress:\n\n```yaml\n# .rr.yaml\ntasks:\n    test-backend:\n        run: cd backend && pytest\n    test-frontend:\n        run: cd frontend && npm test\n    test-opendata:\n        run: cd opendata && python -m pytest\n\n    # Parallel task - runs all three simultaneously across hosts\n    test:\n        parallel: [test-backend, test-frontend, test-opendata]\n        fail_fast: false     # Continue even if one fails\n        max_parallel: 3      # Limit concurrency (optional)\n```\n\n```bash\nrr test\n```\n\n```\n⣾ test-backend [m1-linux]\n⣽ test-frontend [m1-mini]\n⣻ test-opendata [m4-mini]\n```\n\nTasks animate while running, then flip to success/failure in place:\n\n```\n◉ test-backend [m1-linux]\n◉ test-frontend [m1-mini]\n◉ test-opendata [m4-mini]\n\nParallel Execution Summary\n\n  ◉ test-backend on m1-linux (52.9s)\n  ◉ test-frontend on m1-mini (4.0s)\n  ◉ test-opendata on m4-mini (40.0s)\n\n  ◉ 3 passed  ✕ 0 failed  ● 3 total  (52.9s)\n  Hosts: m1-linux, m1-mini, m4-mini\n```\n\n**Why this is powerful:** A 10-minute test suite split across 4 hosts finishes in ~2.5 minutes. For agentic coding workflows where AI agents constantly run tests to verify their work, this means faster feedback loops and less waiting. Multiple agents or features being developed simultaneously get distributed across your machine pool automatically.\n\n**Nested parallel tasks:** Parallel tasks can reference other parallel tasks. `rr` flattens the hierarchy automatically:\n\n```yaml\ntasks:\n    test-opendata:\n        parallel: [opendata-1, opendata-2, opendata-3]\n    test-backend:\n        parallel: [backend-1, backend-2, backend-3]\n    # References both parallel tasks - expands to 7 tasks total\n    test:\n        parallel: [test-opendata, test-backend, frontend]\n```\n\nRun `rr test-opendata` for just the opendata splits, or `rr test` for everything. Add splits to `test-opendata` and `test` automatically includes them.\n\n**Output modes:**\n\n```bash\nrr test              # Default: animated progress\nrr test --stream     # Real-time output with [host:task] prefixes\nrr test --verbose    # Full output shown when each task completes\nrr test --quiet      # Summary only\nrr test --dry-run    # Show plan without executing\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nrr uses two config files to separate personal settings from shareable project settings:\n\n| File    | Location            | Purpose                            | Commit to git? |\n| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |\n| Global  | `~/.rr/config.yaml` | Your hosts, SSH paths, directories | No             |\n| Project | `.rr.yaml`          | Sync rules, tasks, host selection  | Yes            |\n\n**Global config** — your machine definitions:\n\n```yaml\n# ~/.rr/config.yaml\nversion: 1\n\nhosts:\n    mini:\n        ssh:\n            - mac-mini.local # Try LAN first\n            - mac-mini-tailscale # Fall back to VPN\n        dir: ${HOME}/projects/${PROJECT}\n        require: [go, node]  # Tools that must exist on this host\n```\n\n**Project config** — shareable settings:\n\n```yaml\n# .rr.yaml\nversion: 1\nhosts: [mini] # Optional: defaults to all hosts\n\nrequire: [go, golangci-lint]  # Project-level requirements\n\nsync:\n    exclude: [.git/, node_modules/, .venv/]\n\ntasks:\n    build:\n        run: cargo build\n        require: [cargo]  # Task-specific requirement\n```\n\n`${PROJECT}` expands to your local directory name. See [configuration docs](docs/configuration.md) for all options.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Connection failover:** `rr` tries each SSH path in order and uses the first one that connects. Configure your fastest option first:\n\n```yaml\nhosts:\n    gpu-box:\n        ssh:\n            - 192.168.1.50 # LAN - fastest\n            - gpu-tailscale # VPN - works from anywhere\n            - user@backup-gpu # Backup machine\n```\n\n| Your location | What happens                   |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Home (LAN)    | Uses `192.168.1.50`            |\n| Coffee shop   | LAN times out → uses Tailscale |\n| gpu-box busy  | Skips to `backup-gpu`          |\n\n**File sync:** Wraps rsync with smart defaults. Excludes build artifacts, preserves remote-only directories (like `.venv` installed on the remote).\n\n**Locking:** Creates a lock before running commands. If a host is locked, `rr` tries the next host. If all hosts are locked, it round-robins until one frees up.\n\n**Output formatting:** Auto-detects pytest, Jest, Go test, Cargo and formats failures for readability. Disable with `--format=generic`.\n\n## Commands\n\n```bash\n# Core workflow\nrr run \"make test\"      # Sync + run command\nrr exec \"git status\"    # Run without syncing\nrr sync                 # Sync only\n\n# Tasks\nrr test                 # Run named task\nrr tasks                # List available tasks\n\n# Monitoring & status\nrr monitor              # TUI dashboard: CPU/RAM/GPU across hosts\nrr status               # Show connection and sync status\nrr doctor               # Diagnose issues\n\n# Host management\nrr host list            # List configured hosts\nrr host add             # Add a new host interactively\nrr host remove mini     # Remove a host\n\n# Maintenance\nrr unlock               # Release a stuck lock\nrr update               # Update to latest version\nrr completion bash      # Shell completions (also: zsh, fish, powershell)\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nStart with `rr doctor` — it checks your config, SSH setup, and dependencies:\n\n```bash\nrr doctor\n```\n\n![demo-doctor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f6dc8c-649d-439d-ba1f-5ceb237f680c)\n\n**Common issues:**\n\n| Problem                     | Solution                                                                             |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Connection fails            | Run `rr doctor` to check SSH. Ensure you can `ssh user@host` without a password.     |\n| Command not found on remote | Remote PATH differs from interactive shell. Add `shell: \"zsh -l -c\"` to host config. |\n| Sync is slow                | Check exclude patterns — syncing `node_modules` or `.git` tanks performance.         |\n| Lock stuck                  | Run `rr unlock` to release. Locks auto-expire after 10 minutes.                      |\n\nFor more, see the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Guide                                      | Description                         |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |\n| [SSH Setup](docs/ssh-setup.md)             | Get passwordless SSH working        |\n| [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)     | All config options explained        |\n| [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) | Common issues and fixes             |\n| [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)       | How `rr` works under the hood       |\n| [Migration](docs/MIGRATION.md)             | Upgrading from older versions       |\n| [Examples](docs/examples/)                 | Sample configs for different setups |\n\n## Claude Code Integration\n\nIf you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), install the `rr` skill to let Claude help set up and manage your `rr` environment:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/rileyhilliard/rr\n/plugin install rr@rr\n```\n\nOnce installed, Claude can help with setup and troubleshooting. To set up `rr` for your project. From your project root, run:\n\n```\n/rr:setup\n```\n\nThis walks through creating configs, verifying SSH connectivity, testing remote execution, and ensuring dependencies are available on your remote hosts.\n\nSee [docs/claude-code.md](docs/claude-code.md) for details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
