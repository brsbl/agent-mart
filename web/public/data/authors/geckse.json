Covers declarative and programmatic styles, all credential/auth patterns, trigger nodes, and verification requirements. |\n| [n8n-workflow-sdk](plugins/n8n-workflow-sdk/) | Builds, tests, validates, and manages n8n workflows programmatically using the `@n8n/workflow-sdk`. Covers workflow creation, JSON import/export, validation, code generation, AI agent workflows, and the full SDK API. |\n\n## Install via Claude Code Plugin Marketplace\n\nAdd this marketplace and install the plugins:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add geckse/n8n-skills\n/plugin install n8n-node-builder@n8n-skills\n/plugin install n8n-workflow-sdk@n8n-skills\n```\n\nOnce installed, Claude will automatically activate the appropriate skill — `n8n-node-builder` when you ask about building custom n8n nodes, and `n8n-workflow-sdk` when you ask about creating or managing n8n workflows with code.\n\n## Manual Usage\n\nCopy or symlink a skill directory from `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/` into your agent's skills folder. The agent will discover it automatically via the `SKILL.md` frontmatter.\n\n## Format\n\nSkills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open specification and are packaged as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).\n"
