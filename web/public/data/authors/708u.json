Execute twig commands with appropriate flags based on user intent\n2. Protect users from unintended destructive operations\n3. Explain operations clearly before and after execution\n4. Handle errors gracefully with helpful suggestions\n5. Recognize and decline out-of-scope requests with helpful guidance\n\n## Safety Rules\n\n### CRITICAL: Force Flag Confirmation\n\n**ALWAYS ask for explicit user confirmation before executing any command with\n`-f`, `--force`, `-ff`, or similar destructive flags.**\n\nBefore running force operations, you MUST:\n\n1. Explain what the force flag bypasses\n2. List the specific items that will be affected\n3. Ask: \"Do you want me to proceed with this force operation?\"\n4. Wait for explicit confirmation (\"yes\", \"proceed\", etc.)\n\nCommands requiring confirmation:\n\n- `twig remove <branch> -f` or `-ff`\n- `twig clean -f` or `-ff`\n- `twig init --force`\n\nSafe operations (no confirmation needed):\n\n- `twig add`, `twig list`, `twig version`\n- `twig clean --check`\n- `twig remove --dry-run`\n\n### Pre-authorized Force Operations\n\nIf the user explicitly mentions force in their request, proceed without\nadditional confirmation.\n\n- User says \"Force remove feat/old\" -> Proceed with `-f` (pre-authorized)\n- User says \"Remove feat/old\" -> Try without `-f` first, ask if needed\n\n## Operational Process\n\n### twig add\n\n1. Check git status to understand context\n2. Determine flags based on intent:\n   - Copy changes: `--sync`\n   - Move changes: `--carry`\n   - Clean worktree: no sync flags\n3. Execute and report the new worktree path\n\n### twig remove\n\n1. Verify target exists with `twig list`\n2. Try removal without force first\n3. If fails, report issue and ask about `-f` or `-ff`\n\n### twig clean\n\n1. Run `twig clean --check` first\n2. If user approves, use `twig clean --yes`\n3. Confirm before using force flags\n\n## Error Handling\n\nWhen a command fails:\n\n1. Explain what went wrong in plain language\n2. Suggest corrective actions\n3. Offer retry with different options\n\nCommon errors:\n\n- \"worktree already exists\": Branch has a worktree\n- \"uncommitted changes\": Worktree has unsaved work\n- \"branch not merged\": Contains unmerged commits\n- \"worktree is locked\": Protected from removal\n",
        "external/claude-code/plugins/twig/skills/twig-guide/SKILL.md": "---\nname: twig-guide\ndescription: |\n  This skill should be used when the user:\n  - Wants to work on multiple branches simultaneously or in parallel\n  - Needs to start a new feature/task while preserving current work\n  - Asks about git worktree operations (create, remove, list, clean)\n  - Mentions \"twig\" commands (add, remove, clean, list, init)\n  - Wants to carry or move uncommitted changes to a new branch\n  - Wants to copy/sync changes between branches\n  - Needs to isolate work in a separate directory\n  - Asks about switching context without stashing\n  - Wants to clean up old/merged branches and their worktrees\n  - Says phrases like \"new worktree\", \"create worktree\", \"branch off\",\n    \"work on something else\", \"start new work\", \"parallel work\",\n    \"separate workspace\", \"another branch\"\n\n  Use this skill for ANY worktree-related operation, not just when\n  explicitly asking about twig.\n\nallowed-tools: Read\n---\n\n# twig CLI Guide\n\ntwig is a CLI tool that simplifies git worktree workflows by automating branch\ncreation, symlinks, and change management in a single command.\n\n## Commands Overview\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| `twig init` | Initialize twig configuration |\n| `twig add <name>` | Create a new worktree with symlinks |\n| `twig remove <branch>...` | Remove worktrees and their branches |\n| `twig list` | List all worktrees |\n| `twig clean` | Remove unneeded worktrees |\n| `twig sync` | Sync symlinks and submodules to worktrees |\n\n## Typical Workflows\n\n### Start new feature work\n\nCreate a new worktree for a feature branch:\n\n```bash\ntwig add feat/new-feature\n```\n\nThis creates a worktree at the configured destination directory, creates\na new branch if it doesn't exist, and sets up symlinks.\n\n### Move current changes to a new branch\n\nWhen you realize current work should be on a different branch:\n\n```bash\ntwig add feat/correct-branch --carry\n```\n\nThe `--carry` flag moves uncommitted changes to the new worktree.\nThe source worktree becomes clean.\n\n### Copy changes to a new branch\n\nWhen you want changes in both the current and new worktree:\n\n```bash\ntwig add feat/experiment --sync\n```\n\nThe `--sync` flag copies uncommitted changes to both worktrees.\n\n### Carry only specific files\n\nWhen you want to carry only certain files:\n\n```bash\ntwig add feat/new --carry --file \"*.go\" --file \"cmd/**\"\n```\n\n### Clean up after merging\n\nRemove worktrees for branches that have been merged:\n\n```bash\ntwig clean\n```\n\nThis shows candidates and prompts for confirmation. Use `--yes` to skip\nthe prompt.\n\n### Force remove a worktree\n\nRemove a worktree even with uncommitted changes:\n\n```bash\ntwig remove feat/abandoned -f\n```\n\nUse `-ff` to also remove locked worktrees.\n\n## Configuration\n\nsee ./references/configuration.md\n\n## Command Details\n\nFor detailed information on each command, refer to:\n\n- ./references/commands/add.md - Create worktrees with sync/carry options\n- ./references/commands/remove.md - Remove worktrees and branches\n- ./references/commands/list.md - List worktrees\n- ./references/commands/clean.md - Clean merged worktrees\n- ./references/commands/sync.md - Sync symlinks and submodules\n- ./references/commands/init.md - Initialize configuration\n- ./references/configuration.md - Configuration file details\n",

Stashes current changes\n2. Creates the new worktree\n3. Applies stash to new worktree\n4. Restores changes in the source worktree\n\nIf worktree creation or stash apply fails, changes are restored\nto the source worktree automatically.\n\n### Carry Option\n\nWith `--carry`, uncommitted changes are moved to the new worktree:\n\n1. Stashes changes from the specified source\n2. Creates the new worktree\n3. Applies stash to new worktree\n4. Drops the stash (source worktree becomes clean)\n\nUnlike `--sync` which copies changes to both worktrees, `--carry` moves\nchanges so that only the new worktree has them.\n\n```bash\n# Move current work to a new branch\ntwig add feat/new --carry\n\n# Move changes from main worktree\ntwig add feat/new --carry=main\n\n# Move changes from feat/a worktree\ntwig add feat/new --source main --carry=feat/a\n```\n\nThe `--carry` option accepts an optional value to specify where to take\nchanges from:\n\n| Value         | Description                                    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| (no value)    | Take changes from current worktree (default)   |\n| `<branch>`    | Take changes from specified branch's worktree  |\n\n#### Carrying Specific Files\n\nUse `--file` to carry only matching files:\n\n```bash\n# Carry only Go files in root\ntwig add feat/new --carry --file \"*.go\"\n\n# Carry all Go files recursively (globstar)\ntwig add feat/new --carry --file \"**/*.go\"\n\n# Carry multiple patterns\ntwig add feat/new --carry --file \"*.go\" --file \"cmd/**\"\n\n# Carry specific file from another worktree\ntwig add feat/new --carry=feat/a --file config.toml\n```\n\nPatterns support globstar (`**`) for recursive matching.\n\nWhen `--file` is specified:\n\n- Only matching files are stashed and carried to the new worktree\n- Non-matching files remain in the source worktree\n- The source worktree is not completely clean after carry\n\nWithout `--file`, all uncommitted changes are carried (default behavior).\n\nIf worktree creation or stash apply fails, changes are restored\nto the source worktree automatically.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- Cannot be used together with `--sync`\n- `--file` requires the `--carry` flag\n\n### Quiet Option\n\nWith `--quiet`, only the worktree path is output to stdout.\nThis is useful for piping to other commands.\n\n```bash\ncd $(twig add feat/x -q)\n```\n\nWhen `--quiet` is specified, `--verbose` is ignored.\n\n### Source Option\n\nWith `--source`, uses the specified branch's worktree as the source.\n\n```bash\n# From a derived worktree, create a new worktree based on main\ntwig add feat/new --source main\n```\n\nWhen `--source` is specified:\n\n- Settings are loaded from the source branch's worktree\n- Symlinks are created from the source branch's worktree\n- With `--sync`, changes are stashed from the source branch's worktree\n- With `--carry` (no value), changes are stashed from the current worktree\n- With `--carry=<branch>`, changes are stashed from the specified branch's\n  worktree\n\nConstraints:\n\n- The specified branch must have an existing worktree\n\nWhen used with `-C`:\n\n- `-C` sets the working directory and loads config from that location\n- `--source` searches for the branch within that directory's worktree group\n- This allows running `twig add` from outside any worktree\n\n```bash\n# From any directory, create worktree using repo's settings\ntwig add feat/new -C /path/to/repo --source main\n```\n\n### Lock Option\n\nWith `--lock`, the worktree is locked after creation to prevent automatic\npruning by `git worktree prune`. This is useful for worktrees on portable\ndevices or network shares that are not always mounted.\n\n```bash\n# Create a locked worktree\ntwig add feat/usb-work --lock\n\n# Create a locked worktree with a reason\ntwig add feat/usb-work --lock --reason \"USB drive work\"\n```\n\nThe `--reason` option requires `--lock` and adds an explanation for why\nthe worktree is locked. This reason is displayed by `git worktree list`.\n\nLocked worktrees require `--force` (or `-f -f`) to be moved or removed\nwith git commands.\n\n### Submodule Initialization\n\nWith `--init-submodules`, submodules are initialized in the new worktree\nafter creation. This runs `git submodule update --init --recursive`.\n\n```bash\n# Initialize submodules in new worktree\ntwig add feat/new --init-submodules\n```\n\nThe behavior can be configured in `.twig/settings.toml`:\n\n```toml\ninit_submodules = true\n```\n\nPriority:\n\n1. CLI flag `--init-submodules` (forces enable)\n2. Config `init_submodules`\n3. Default: disabled\n\nTo disable submodule initialization when config enables it, use\n`.twig/settings.local.toml`:\n\n```toml\ninit_submodules = false\n```\n\nIf submodule initialization fails, a warning is displayed but the worktree\ncreation succeeds. This ensures the worktree is usable even if submodule\nservers are temporarily unavailable.\n\n### Submodule Reference\n\nWith `--submodule-reference`, submodule initialization reuses objects from\nthe main worktree instead of fetching from the remote. This can significantly\nreduce initialization time for large submodules.\n\n```bash\n# Use reference for faster submodule init\ntwig add feat/new --init-submodules --submodule-reference\n```\n\nPrerequisite: Submodules must be initialized in the main worktree first.\nIf not initialized, a warning is displayed and normal initialization is used.\n\nThe behavior can be configured in `.twig/settings.toml`:\n\n```toml\ninit_submodules = true\nsubmodule_reference = true\n```\n\nPriority:\n\n1. CLI flag `--submodule-reference` (forces enable)\n2. Config `submodule_reference`\n3. Default: disabled\n\n### Default Source Configuration\n\nThe default source branch can be configured in `.twig/settings.toml`:\n\n```toml\ndefault_source = \"main\"\n```\n\nPriority:\n\n1. CLI `--source` flag (highest)\n2. Config `default_source`\n3. Current worktree (lowest)\n\nWhen `-C` is specified, `default_source` from that directory's config is\napplied. This provides consistent behavior: the config loaded by `-C` is\nfully respected.\n\n```bash\n# If /path/to/repo has default_source = \"main\" in its config:\ntwig add feat/new -C /path/to/repo\n# This is equivalent to:\ntwig add feat/new -C /path/to/repo --source main\n```\n\nThe setting can be overridden in `.twig/settings.local.toml` for personal\npreferences:\n\n```toml\n# settings.local.toml\ndefault_source = \"develop\"\n```\n\nTo bypass `default_source` and use the current worktree, specify the current\nbranch with `--source`:\n\n```bash\n# Explicitly use current worktree instead of default_source\ntwig add feat/x --source feat/a  # assuming you're on feat/a\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSee [Configuration](../configuration.md) for details on settings files,\navailable fields, and merge rules.\n",

The clean command detects these\nprunable branches and includes them as cleanup candidates.\n\nPrunable branches are identified by git's prunable status (from\n`git worktree list --porcelain`). Only branches that were previously\nassociated with a worktree are detected - regular branches created with\n`git branch` are not affected.\n\nSafety checks for prunable branches:\n\n| Condition | Description                                     |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Merged    | Branch is merged to target or upstream is gone  |\n\nOther checks (locked, changes, current directory) don't apply since\nthe worktree no longer exists.\n\n### Upstream Gone Branches\n\nBranches whose remote tracking branch has been deleted are detected as\n\"upstream gone\" and cleaned without requiring `--force`.\n\n### Merge Detection\n\nThe clean command detects merged branches using:\n\n1. `git branch --merged` - traditional merge commits\n2. Upstream gone status - squash/rebase merges via PR\n\n**Limitation:** Local-only fast-forward merges are not detected. When a branch\nis fast-forward merged locally (without `--no-ff`), both the branch and target\npoint to the same commit. This is indistinguishable from a newly created branch\nthat was never worked on.\n\n| Merge Type              | Detection Method     | Detected |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Merge commit (`--no-ff`)| `git branch --merged`| Yes      |\n| Squash merge (PR)       | Upstream gone        | Yes      |\n| Rebase merge (PR)       | Upstream gone        | Yes      |\n| Local fast-forward      | (none)               | No       |\n\nTo clean local fast-forward merged branches, use `--force`:\n\n```bash\ntwig clean -f --yes\n```\n\n### Force Option\n\nWith `--force` (`-f`), some safety checks can be bypassed:\n\n| Force Level | Bypassed Conditions                              |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| `-f`        | Uncommitted changes, not merged, dirty submodule |\n| `-ff`       | Above + locked worktrees                         |\n\nThe following conditions are never bypassed:\n\n- Current directory (dangerous to remove cwd)\n- Detached HEAD (RemoveCommand requires branch name)\n\nThis matches `twig remove` behavior where `-f` removes unclean worktrees\nand `-ff` also removes locked worktrees.\n\n```bash\n# Force clean unmerged branches with uncommitted changes\ntwig clean -f --yes\n\n# Also force clean locked worktrees\ntwig clean -ff --yes\n```\n\n### Target Branch Detection\n\nIf `--target` is not specified, auto-detects from the first\nnon-bare worktree (usually main).\n\n### Additional Actions\n\nThe command also runs `git worktree prune` to clean up references\nto worktrees that no longer exist.\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput is grouped by status with indentation.

[flags]\n```\n\n## Arguments\n\n- `<branch>...`: One or more branch names to remove (required)\n\n## Flags\n\n| Flag        | Short | Description                                         |\n|-------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| `--force`   | `-f`  | Force removal (can be specified twice, see below)   |\n| `--check`   |       | Show removal eligibility without making changes     |\n| `--verbose` | `-v`  | Enable verbose output (use `-vv` for debug logging) |\n\n## Behavior\n\n- Finds the worktree path by looking up the branch name\n- Prevents removal if current directory is inside the target worktree\n- Cleans up empty parent directories after removal (see below)\n- With `--check`: prints what would be removed without making changes\n- Without `--force`: fails if there are uncommitted changes,\n  submodules have uncommitted changes, the branch is not merged,\n  or the worktree is locked\n- With `-f` (once): bypasses uncommitted changes, dirty submodule,\n  and unmerged branch checks\n- With `-ff` (twice): also bypasses locked worktree checks\n\nThis matches git's behavior where `git worktree remove -f` removes unclean\nworktrees and `git worktree remove -f -f` also removes locked worktrees.\n\n### Submodule Handling\n\n`git worktree remove` requires `--force` for any worktree containing initialized\nsubmodules, even when submodules are clean. twig improves this behavior:\n\n- **Clean submodules**: Removed automatically without requiring `--force`.\n  twig detects that submodules have no uncommitted changes and handles the\n  removal safely.\n- **Dirty submodules**: Fails with \"submodule has uncommitted changes\".\n  Use `--force` to remove anyway.\n\n### Prunable Worktrees\n\nWhen a worktree directory is deleted externally (via `rm -rf` or other means),\nthe branch remains but the worktree becomes \"prunable\". The remove command\nhandles this gracefully:\n\n```bash\n# Worktree deleted externally\nrm -rf /path/to/feat/x\n\n# twig remove still works - prunes the stale record and deletes the branch\ntwig remove feat/x\n```\n\nFor prunable worktrees:\n\n- Stale worktree records are pruned automatically\n- Branch is deleted as usual\n- No cwd check is performed (directory doesn't exist)\n- `--check` shows \"Would prune stale worktree record\"\n\n### Upstream Gone Branches\n\nBranches whose remote tracking branch has been deleted are detected as\n\"upstream gone\" and removed without requiring `--force`.\n\n### Empty Directory Cleanup\n\nAfter removing a worktree, twig automatically removes any empty parent\ndirectories up to `WorktreeDestBaseDir`. This prevents orphan directories\nfrom blocking future branch creation.\n\nExample:\n\n```txt\n# Remove feat/test worktree\ntwig remove feat/test\n\n# If feat/ directory is now empty, it is also removed\n# This allows creating a 'feat' branch later\n```\n\nThe cleanup is safe:\n\n- Only removes empty directories\n- Stops at `WorktreeDestBaseDir` boundary\n- Preserves directories containing other worktrees or files\n- Cleanup errors are non-fatal (main operation succeeds)\n\n### Verbose Output\n\nWith `--verbose`, additional information is displayed:\n\n- With `--check`: shows the list of uncommitted changes in the worktree\n- On failure due to uncommitted changes: shows the list of changed files\n\nExample with `--check --verbose`:\n\n```txt\ntwig remove feat/test --check -v\nWould remove worktree: /path/to/feat/test\nUncommitted changes:\n   M src/main.go\n  A  src/new.go\n  ?? tmp/debug.log\nWould delete branch: feat/test\n```\n\nExample on failure with `--verbose`:\n\n```txt\ntwig remove feat/test -v\nerror: feat/test: cannot remove: has uncommitted changes\nUncommitted changes:\n   M src/main.go\n  ?? tmp/debug.log\nhint: use 'twig remove --force' to force removal\n```\n\nThe status codes follow git status --porcelain format:\n\n| Code | Meaning              |\n|------|----------------------|\n| `M` | Modified (unstaged)  |\n| `M` | Modified (staged)    |\n| `A` | Added (staged)       |\n| `??` | Untracked            |\n\n### Output Modes\n\nBy default, successful removal produces no output (silent mode).\nUse `--verbose` to see detailed output:\n\n```txt\n# Default: silent on success\ntwig remove feat/test\n\n# Verbose: shows what was removed\ntwig remove feat/test -v\nRemoved worktree and branch: feat/test\n```\n\n### Debug Output\n\nWith `-vv`, debug logging is enabled to trace internal operations:\n\n```txt\n# Debug output (shows internal operation traces)\ntwig remove feat/test -vv\n2026-01-18 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] remove: checking branch=feat/test path=/path/to/feat/test\n2026-01-18 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] remove: check completed canRemove=true branch=feat/test\nRemoved worktree and branch: feat/test\n```\n\n## Multiple Branches\n\nWhen multiple branches are specified, errors on individual branches\ndo not stop processing of remaining branches.

This is useful when configuration changes (symlinks, submodules)\nneed to be applied to existing worktrees.\n\n### Source Resolution\n\nThe source worktree is determined in this order:\n\n1. `--source` flag if specified\n2. `default_source` configuration if set\n3. Current worktree (fallback)\n\n### Target Resolution\n\nTargets are determined based on arguments and flags:\n\n| Arguments | `--all` | Behavior                            |\n|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------|\n| None      | No      | Sync current worktree (see note)    |\n| None      | Yes     | Sync all worktrees (except main)    |\n| Specified | No      | Sync specified worktrees            |\n| Specified | Yes     | Error (mutually exclusive)          |\n\n**Note:** When no targets are specified and source falls back to current\nworktree (no `--source` flag and no `default_source` config), this results\nin syncing current worktree to itself, which is an error.\n\n### What Gets Synced\n\nThe command syncs based on the source worktree's configuration:\n\n| Configuration       | Action                                          |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `symlinks`          | Create symlinks from source to target           |\n| `init_submodules`   | Initialize submodules in target worktrees       |\n\nIf neither `symlinks` nor `init_submodules` is configured, the command exits\nearly with a message indicating nothing to sync.\n\n### Symlink Behavior\n\nSymlinks are synchronized to match the source worktree. Existing symlinks are\nreplaced to ensure synchronization. Regular files are never overwritten.\n\n| Condition               | Behavior                                |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| No file at destination  | Create symlink                          |\n| Symlink exists          | Replace with new symlink                |\n| Regular file exists     | Skip (not replaced, prevents data loss) |\n\n### Check Mode\n\nWith `--check`, the command shows what would be synced without making changes.\nThis is useful for previewing the sync operation.\n\n## Output Format\n\n### Default Output\n\n```txt\nSynced feat/a from main: 2 symlinks created, 1 submodule(s) initialized\nSkipped feat/b: up to date\n```\n\n### Verbose Output\n\n```txt\nSyncing from main to feat/a\nCreated symlink: /repo/feat/a/.envrc -> /repo/main/.envrc\nCreated symlink: /repo/feat/a/.tool-versions -> /repo/main/.tool-versions\nInitialized 1 submodule(s)\nSynced feat/a from main: 2 symlinks created, 1 submodule(s) initialized\n```\n\n### Check Mode Output\n\n```txt\nWould sync from main:\n\nfeat/a:\n  Would create symlink: /repo/feat/a/.envrc\n  Would create symlink: /repo/feat/a/.tool-versions\n  Would initialize submodules\n\nfeat/b:\n  (skipped: up to date)\n```\n\n### Debug Output\n\nWith `-vv`, debug logging traces internal operations:\n\n```txt\n2026-01-19 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] sync: resolving source branch=main\n2026-01-19 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] sync: loading config from source\n2026-01-19 12:34:56.000 [DEBUG] [a1b2c3d4] sync: syncing target branch=feat/a\nSynced feat/a: 2 symlinks created\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# Sync current worktree from default_source\ntwig sync\n\n# Sync specific worktrees\ntwig sync feat/a feat/b\n\n# Sync all worktrees (except main)\ntwig sync --all\n\n# Sync from a specific source branch\ntwig sync --source develop\n\n# Preview what would be synced\ntwig sync --check\n\n# Sync all with verbose output\ntwig sync --all -v\n\n# Sync with debug logging\ntwig sync -vv\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe sync command uses configuration from the source worktree:\n\n```toml\n# .twig/settings.toml in source worktree\nsymlinks = [\".envrc\", \".tool-versions\", \"config/**\"]\ninit_submodules = true\n```\n\nSee [Configuration](../configuration.md) for details.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n| Condition                        | Behavior                              |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| No source + no targets specified | Error with hint                       |\n| Source worktree not found        | Error                                 |\n| Target worktree not found        | Error for that target                 |\n| Target is same as source         | Skipped                               |\n| Symlink creation fails           | Error for that target, others proceed |\n| Submodule init fails             | Warning (non-fatal)                   |\n\n## Exit Code\n\n- 0: Success (or nothing to sync)\n- 1: One or more targets failed to sync\n",
