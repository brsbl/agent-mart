With a comprehensive .NET Clean Architecture suite and general architecture tools, it helps you build robust, maintainable software systems faster.\n\n**Perfect for:**\n- .NET developers building Clean Architecture applications\n- Teams migrating legacy code to modern patterns\n- Architects seeking pattern guidance and code reviews\n- Developers learning Clean Architecture and DDD\n\n## Features\n\n### .NET Clean Architecture Suite\n- **Scaffold complete projects** with Clean Architecture, DDD, and Repository pattern\n- **Generate CRUD features** across all layers in minutes\n- **Migrate legacy code** to Clean Architecture with guided refactoring\n- **Audit architecture** for violations and anti-patterns\n- **Pattern library** with 14 proven examples from Microsoft's eShopOnWeb\n\n### Architecture Guidance\n- **Expert skills** for architecture patterns and design principles\n- **Code review** with specialized subagents\n- **Quick commands** for common architecture workflows\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install from GitHub\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add waelouf/dev-architect\n\nclaude plugin install dev-architect\n```\n\n### Install Locally\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/waelouf/dev-architect.git\ncd dev-architect\n```\n\n2. Link the plugin:\n```bash\nclaude-code plugin link .\n```\n\n3. Update:\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update dev-architect\n```\n## Usage\n\n### Skills\n\nSkills can be invoked during conversations when relevant tasks arise. Available skills:\n\n#### `dotnet-clean-arch`\nComprehensive skill for building .NET Clean Architecture monolithic applications with FastEndpoints, Repository pattern, and Domain-Driven Design.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- Scaffold complete Clean Architecture projects from scratch\n- Generate full-stack CRUD features across all layers\n- Migrate existing codebases to Clean Architecture\n- Audit architecture for violations and anti-patterns\n- Browse and copy proven patterns from Microsoft's eShopOnWeb\n\n[Read full documentation →](skills/dotnet-clean-arch/README.md)\n\n#### `azure-cloud-architect`\nExpert guidance for building Azure cloud infrastructure and DevOps pipelines from scratch through production. Full lifecycle coverage - provision, configure, deploy, monitor, secure, optimize.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- Provision infrastructure with Bicep and Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)\n- Setup CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps\n- Deploy applications to Azure services (App Service, AKS, Functions, etc.)\n- Configure monitoring, logging, and alerts for production readiness\n- Implement security best practices (Managed Identity, Private Endpoints, zero credentials)\n- Optimize costs with FinOps principles and real pricing calculations\n- Design shared resources and multi-tenancy patterns\n- Setup multi-environment architecture (dev/staging/prod)\n\n[Read full documentation →](skills/azure-cloud-architect/README.md)\n\n#### `architecture-patterns`\nExpert guidance on software architecture patterns and design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc.).\n\n### Slash Commands\n\nUse slash commands for quick access to common workflows:\n\n#### .NET Clean Architecture Commands\n\n- `/dotnet-clean-arch:new` - Scaffold a new Clean Architecture solution with interactive wizard\n- `/dotnet-clean-arch:add-feature <EntityName>` - Generate complete CRUD feature across all layers\n- `/dotnet-clean-arch:migrate` - Migrate existing codebase to Clean Architecture with guided refactoring\n- `/dotnet-clean-arch:audit` - Scan project for Clean Architecture violations and anti-patterns\n- `/dotnet-clean-arch:patterns` - Browse and copy 14 proven patterns with interactive examples\n\n#### Architecture Analysis\n\n- `/analyze-architecture [path]` - Analyze codebase architecture and provide recommendations\n\n### Subagents\n\nSpecialized agents for focused tasks:\n\n- **`code-reviewer`** - Review code quality, architecture, and best practices with detailed feedback\n\n## Quick Start Examples\n\n### Building a .NET Clean Architecture API\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create a new Clean Architecture project\n/dotnet-clean-arch:new\n\n# 2. Add CRUD features\n/dotnet-clean-arch:add-feature Product\n/dotnet-clean-arch:add-feature Order\n/dotnet-clean-arch:add-feature Customer\n\n# 3. Verify architecture compliance\n/dotnet-clean-arch:audit\n\n# 4. Run the application\ndotnet run --project src/API\n```\n\n### Analyzing an Existing Codebase\n\n```bash\n# Analyze architecture patterns\n/analyze-architecture\n\n# Check for Clean Architecture violations\n/dotnet-clean-arch:audit\n\n# Get migration guidance\n/dotnet-clean-arch:migrate\n```\n\n### Learning Patterns\n\n```bash\n# Browse architecture patterns\n/dotnet-clean-arch:patterns\n\n# Get specific guidance\n# (skill will be invoked automatically when discussing architecture)\n```\n\n## Structure\n\n```\ndev-architect/\n├── skills/              # Skill definitions\n├── commands/            # Slash command definitions\n├── subagents/           # Subagent configurations\n├── package.json         # Plugin metadata\n├── README.md           # This file\n├── LICENSE             # MIT License\n└── CONTRIBUTING.md     # Contribution guidelines\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
