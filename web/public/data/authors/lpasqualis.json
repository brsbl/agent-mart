        "README.md": "# My Claude Code Configuration (Example Repository)\n\n**This is my personal Claude Code configuration that I maintain in Git.** I'm sharing it publicly as an example of how to organize and version-control a Claude Code setup. This system works for me and my needs, but might not work for others. My requirements are:\n\n1. **Make components available globally** - Have my slash commands, agents, hooks, etc. accessible across all projects I work on\n2. **Source control everything** - Version control these components for history, backup, and evolution tracking\n3. **Multi-machine sync** - Use the same setup on multiple machines and systems seamlessly\n4. **Learn by doing** - Continue learning about agentic systems by experimenting with different patterns\n5. **Share and improve** - Document my approach for others and gather feedback to improve\n\n> **What this is:** My personal collection of agents, slash commands, and tools that I use across all my projects.\n> \n> **What this isn't:** A framework or product to install. It's one person's configuration shared as a reference.\n\n## Why I'm Sharing This\n\nClaude Code supports personal configurations via `~/.claude/`, but there aren't many examples of how to organize and maintain them. This repository shows:\n\n- **How I structure my configuration** for maintainability\n- **How I use Git** to version control and sync across machines\n- **Examples of agents, slash commands, and hooks** I've found useful\n- **Patterns for organizing** a growing collection of Claude customizations\n\n## Installation Options\n\n### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is via Claude Code's plugin system.\n\n**Quick Install:**\n\n1. In Claude Code, type `/plugin` and select \"Add marketplace\"\n2. Enter: `https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude`\n3. Type `/plugin` again and select \"Install plugin\"\n4. Choose `lpclaude-config` from the list\n5. Restart Claude Code\n\n**Or use commands directly:**\n```bash\n# Step 1: Add the marketplace (HTTPS format recommended)\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude\n\n# Step 2: Install the plugin\n/plugin install lpclaude-config\n```\n\n**Or skip the marketplace and install directly:**\n```bash\n/plugin install https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ One-command installation\n- ✅ Automatic updates via plugin system\n- ✅ Easy to enable/disable without uninstalling\n- ✅ No manual symlink management\n- ✅ Works alongside your personal `~/.claude/` configs\n\nSee [PLUGIN_INSTALL.md](PLUGIN_INSTALL.md) for detailed plugin documentation.\n\n### Option 2: Traditional Setup (Manual Control)\n\nFor full control over files and symlinks:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude\ncd ~/.lpclaude\n./setup.sh\n```\n\nSee [\"If You Want to Try My Components\"](#if-you-want-to-try-my-components) section below for details.\n\n### Option 3: Browse and Learn\n\n**Not ready to install?** You can also:\n\n#### As a Reference\nBrowse the repository to:\n- See how to structure your own Claude configuration\n- Get ideas for agents and slash commands you might want to create\n- Learn the syntax and patterns for different component types\n- Understand how various Claude Code features work together\n\n#### Copy Individual Components\nIf you find something useful:\n1. Copy the specific file to your own `~/.claude/` directory\n2. Customize it for your needs\n3. Make it yours - don't just use my configuration as-is\n\n#### Fork as a Starting Point\nTo create your own configuration repository:\n1. Fork this repo\n2. Delete my specific configurations\n3. Add your own agents, slash commands, and preferences\n4. Maintain your own version-controlled Claude setup\n\n## What's in My Configuration\n\nHere's what I've built for my workflow (yours will be different):\n\n- **Slash Commands** (30+) - My shortcuts for git, documentation, job processing, learning capture, VS Code theming\n- **Agents** - Auto-triggering helpers I use for security reviews, documentation, task queueing\n- **Workers** - My custom pattern: reusable task templates that slash commands can run in parallel (not a Claude feature)\n- **Hooks** - Shell scripts that prevent me from making mistakes (like cd'ing to wrong directories)\n- **Output Styles** - How I prefer Claude to format responses for different contexts\n- **Status Line** - My terminal prompt integration showing session context\n- **Utility Scripts** - Helper tools like my `addjob` task queuing system\n- **Directives** - General directives split into numbered files, compiled into CLAUDE.md (see [Directives Compilation](#directives-compilation) below)\n- **Resources** - Research and documentation I've collected about Claude Code patterns\n- **Organization** - How I structure everything to stay maintainable\n\n> **New to Claude Code?** Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI that brings Claude's AI capabilities directly to your terminal. It natively supports personal configurations via `~/.claude/` - this repository is just one example of how to use that feature.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing this configuration, you'll need:\n\n### 1. Claude Code Installed\nClaude Code is Anthropic's official CLI for AI-powered coding assistance.\n- **Installation Guide**: [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)\n- **Quick Check**: Run `claude --version` in your terminal\n\n### 2. Understanding ~/.claude Directory\n- This is Claude Code's built-in location for \"personal\" configurations and tools\n- It applies to all projects you work on your machine\n- This repository uses symlinks to replace specific folders (agents, commands, etc.)\n- Non sym-linked parts of your .claude configuration remain untouched\n- This separation ensures the repo can be updated without affecting the rest of your personal configurations\n\n### 3. System Requirements\n- **OS**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL\n- **Tools**: Git and basic terminal familiarity\n- **Space**: ~10MB for the configuration files\n- **Optional**: VS Code for visual editing (any text editor works)\n\n> **First time using Claude Code?** Start with the Quick Try section below to test individual components before full installation.\n\n## What's Included\n\n### Agents\n- **completion-verifier** - Verifies task completion claims\n- **delegate** - Delegates tasks to external LLMs\n- **documentation-auditor** - Audits documentation against code\n- **hack-spotter** - Reviews code for security issues and technical debt\n- **implan-auditor** - Reviews implementation plans for completeness\n\n### Slash Commands\n\n#### Git & Version Control\n- `/git:commit-and-push` - Intelligent commits with semantic versioning\n- `/git:rewrite-commit-descriptions` - Improve commit messages\n#### Documentation\n\n- `/docs` - Documentation utilities\n- `/docs:capture-session` - Document work for team handoff\n- `/docs:capture-strategy` - Capture strategic decisions\n- `/docs:readme-audit` - Audit and optimize README files\n- `/pdf2md` - Convert PDF to Markdown\n\n#### Planning & Implementation\n- `/implan:create` - Generate implementation plans\n- `/implan:execute` - Execute implementation plans\n- `/postmortem` - Analyze session to identify and document issues for systematic fixing\n\n#### Job Queue Management\n- **addjob** - Queue tasks (Python utility, also has supporting agent)\n- `/jobs:do` - Execute queued jobs in parallel\n- `/jobs:auto-improve` - Natural language project improvement that continuously finds and fixes issues\n- `/jobs:queue-learnings` - Queue learnings for processing\n\n#### Code Quality & Validation\n- `/hackcheck` - Check for code hacks and shortcuts\n- `/doublecheck` - Verify implementation completeness\n- `/commands:validate` - Validate code or configurations\n- `/simplify` - Simplify complex code or text\n\n#### Context & Memory Management  \n- `/learn` - Add insights to CLAUDE.md or extract from conversation\n- `/claude:optimize-md` - Optimize CLAUDE.md files\n- `/question` - Answer questions without taking action\n- `/docs:capture-session` - Document work for team handoff (preserves context)\n\n#### Framework Development\n- `/commands:create` - Interactive slash command creator\n- `/add-parallelization` - Add parallel processing to slash commands\n- `/optimize` - General optimization command\n- `/subagents:optimize` - Optimize subagent definitions\n- `/subagents:review-ecosystem` - Analyze agent interactions\n- `/worker:run` - Run worker templates\n\n#### VS Code Integration\n- `/vs:settings-help` - VS Code settings assistance\n- `/vs:tint-workspace` - Tint VS Code workspace\n\n### Hooks\n- **guard-cd** - Prevents Claude from changing directories and losing context\n- **show-cwd** - Shows current working directory\n\n### Output Styles\n- **html-documentation** - HTML formatted documentation output\n- **yaml-structured** - YAML structured data output\n\n### Utilities\n- **Global directives** - Coding standards and patterns via CLAUDE.md\n\n## Usage\n\n- **Agents** activate automatically based on keywords in your conversation with Claude\n- **Slash commands** are typed directly in Claude Code (e.g., `/git:commit-and-push`)\n- **addjob** (shell utility) queues tasks from your terminal, then `/jobs:do` (slash command) executes them in parallel in Claude\n\n## How It Works\n\nIf you choose to use the standard setup (you don't have to), this repository uses **selective symbolic links** to integrate with Claude Code's configuration system:\n\n```\n~/.claude/                         This Repository (symlinked folders)\n├── agents/ ───────→           ~/.lpclaude/agents/\n├── commands/ ─────→           ~/.lpclaude/commands/\n├── directives/ ───→           ~/.lpclaude/directives/\n├── hooks/ ────────→           ~/.lpclaude/hooks/\n├── mcp/ ──────────→           ~/.lpclaude/mcp/\n├── output-styles/ →           ~/.lpclaude/output-styles/\n├── resources/ ────→           ~/.lpclaude/resources/\n├── utils/ ────────→           ~/.lpclaude/utils/\n├── workers/ ──────→           ~/.lpclaude/workers/\n├── settings.json ─→           ~/.lpclaude/settings/settings.json\n├── statusline.sh ─→           ~/.lpclaude/statusline/statusline.sh\n├── CLAUDE.md ─────→           ~/.lpclaude/directives/CLAUDE_global_directives.md\n│\n├── [Your personal files remain here, untouched]\n├── memory/                    (Your personal memory files)\n├── .claude.json               (Your personal project settings)\n└── [Other personal configs]   (Any other personal configurations)\n```\n\n**Important: Symlinks Replace Entire Folders**: When you use symlinks (via setup.sh), each symlinked folder completely replaces that folder in `~/.claude/`. For example, symlinking `agents/` means ALL agents come from this repo - you can't mix repo agents with your own agents in that folder.\n\n**If you want to pick and choose specific components**:\n- Don't use the symlink setup\n- Instead, manually copy individual files you want from this repo to your `~/.claude/` folders\n- This lets you combine components from this repo with your own custom components\n\n**Benefits of the symlink approach**:\n- Keep the repository cleanly separated from your personal configurations\n- Allow your `~/.claude/` to evolve with your personal settings, memory files, and project-specific configs\n- Enable easy updates to the shared components without touching your personal data\n- Make uninstallation simple - just remove the symlinks, your personal config remains\n\n\n### Component Interaction\n\n```\n   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   │            GLOBAL DIRECTIVES (CLAUDE.md)            │\n   │         Loaded at startup, applies to everything    │\n   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                            ┃\n                            ▼\n   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   │             Your Claude Code Session                │\n   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n         ┃                  ┃                    ┃\n         ▼                  ▼                    ▼\n   ┌────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐\n   │   AGENTS   │    │SLASH COMMANDS│    │    HOOKS    │\n   │(automatic) │    │ (explicit /) │    │ (lifecycle) │\n   └────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────────────┘\n                            ┃\n                   (some slash commands)\n                            ▼\n                  ┌──────────────────┐\n                  │     WORKERS      │\n                  │ (parallel tasks) │\n                  └──────────────────┘\n\nHow Components Work:\n• DIRECTIVES: Define behavior and standards for all interactions\n• AGENTS: Auto-trigger on keywords (e.g., \"security\" → hack-spotter)\n• SLASH COMMANDS: User types /command (e.g., /git:commit-and-push)\n• HOOKS: Run at specific events (e.g., before shell commands)\n• WORKERS*: My custom pattern - reusable task templates for parallel execution\n• OUTPUT STYLES: Format Claude's responses (not shown)\n\n*Note: Workers are not a Claude Code feature - they're my pattern for organizing\nreusable task instructions that slash commands can execute in parallel via the Task tool,\nwithout the overhead of creating full agents that consume context space.\n```\n\n## If You Want to Try My Components\n\n### Option 1: Copy Individual Pieces (Recommended)\n**Browse and copy only what's useful to you.**\n\nCherry-pick specific components:\n\n```bash\n# First, clone the repo (if not already done)\ngit clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude\n\n# Create directories as needed\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/commands/git\n\n# Copy only the components you want\ncp ~/.lpclaude/agents/hack-spotter.md ~/.claude/agents/\ncp ~/.lpclaude/commands/git/commit-and-push.md ~/.claude/commands/git/\ncp ~/.lpclaude/hooks/guard-cd.sh ~/.claude/hooks/\n```\n\n**Benefits of selective installation:**\n- Mix components from this repo with your own custom agents/slash commands\n- Keep some folders under your control while using others from this repo\n- Test individual components before committing to the full set\n\n**Drawbacks:**\n- Manual updates - you'll need to copy files again when the repo updates\n- Potential dependency issues if components rely on each other\n- No automatic compilation of directives\n\n\n### Option 2: Use My Entire Setup (Not Recommended)\n\n**Only do this if you really want MY exact configuration.** This is how I set up my own machines, but you probably want your own configuration, not mine.\n\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/lpasqualis/lpclaude.git ~/.lpclaude\ncd ~/.lpclaude\n\n# Run setup (creates symlinks and installs optional dependencies)\n./setup.sh\n```\n\n#### What setup.sh Does:\n1. **Attempts to create symbolic links** in `~/.claude/` pointing to this repository:\n   - **Claude-standard folders** (recognized by Claude Code):\n     - `agents/` - Auto-triggering AI agents\n     - `commands/` - Slash commands\n     - `output-styles/` - Response formatting styles\n     - `hooks/` - Event-triggered shell scripts\n     - `CLAUDE.md` - Shared memory file\n   - **Supporting folders**:\n     - `directives/` - Compiled preferences and standards\n     - `resources/` - Reference documents and guides\n     - `utils/` - Helper scripts (like addjob)\n     - `workers/` - Parallel processing templates\n     - `mcp/` - Model Context Protocol servers\n   - **Configuration files**:\n     - `settings.json` - Claude Code settings\n     - `statusline.sh` - Terminal prompt integration\n   - **Only creates symlinks if the target doesn't exist**\n   - **If folders/files already exist**: Skips them entirely (your content is preserved)\n   - Everything else in `~/.claude/` remains completely untouched\n2. **Installs optional dependencies** (if not present):\n   - `brew` - Package manager (macOS only)\n   - `jq` - JSON processor used by some commands\n   - `llm` - Tool for delegating to external LLMs\n   - Modern terminal fonts for better display\n3. **Compiles directives** into a single CLAUDE.md file\n4. **Validates installation** and reports any issues\n\n#### Important: Handling Existing Folders\n- **If you have existing `agents/` or `commands/` folders**: The setup will skip them and warn you\n- **To use this repo with existing folders**, you have three options:\n  1. Backup and move your existing folders: `mv ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/agents.backup`\n  2. Use selective installation (Option 1 above) to manually copy specific files\n  3. Merge your content into this repo and fork it\n\n\n### Optional: Make addjob Available System-Wide\n\nTo use the `addjob` utility from any directory, add an alias to your shell configuration:\n\n**For zsh (default on modern macOS):**\n```bash\necho \"alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'\" >> ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n**For bash:**\n```bash\necho \"alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n**For fish:**\n```bash\necho \"alias addjob='python3 ~/.claude/utils/addjob'\" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish\nsource ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n```\n\n## Session Context & Memory Management\n\nClaude Code sessions have limited context windows, so I've developed patterns to manage both memory and context effectively:\n\n### Context Management Strategies\n- **CLAUDE.md** - Persistent directives loaded at session start (doesn't consume conversation context)\n- **Agents vs Workers** - Agents consume context even when idle; workers are loaded only when needed\n- **Selective Tool Usage** - Some slash commands delegate to the Task tool to avoid loading everything into main context\n- **Job Queuing** - The `addjob` system defers work to future sessions, preserving context for current tasks\n\n### Memory Persistence\n- **Global Memory** - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` persists across all projects and sessions\n- **Project Memory** - `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in projects adds project-specific context\n- **Session Capture** - Slash commands like `/docs:capture-session` preserve session knowledge for handoffs\n- **Learning Extraction** - `/learn` slash command extracts insights from conversations into permanent memory\n\n### Why This Matters\nContext is precious in AI systems. By managing it carefully, I can:\n- Work on larger, more complex tasks without hitting limits\n- Maintain consistent behavior across sessions\n- Build up institutional knowledge over time\n- Hand off work between sessions or team members effectively\n\n## Directives Compilation\n\nI organize my Claude directives (coding standards, behavioral guidelines, technical patterns) using a compilation system that might be unnecessary with Claude's newer @-mention feature.\n\n### How My Directives System Works\n\n1. **Numbered directive files** in `directives/`:\n   - `0010_core_principles.md` - Core behavioral guidelines\n   - `0020_prompt_engineering.md` - AI prompt best practices  \n   - `0030_engineering_strategies.md` - Technical patterns\n   - Files are numbered to control compilation order\n\n2. **Compilation via `rebuild_claude_md.sh`**:\n   ```bash\n   ./rebuild_claude_md.sh\n   ```\n   - Concatenates all `.md` files in `directives/` folder\n   - Processes them in alphabetical order (hence the numbering)\n   - Creates `directives/CLAUDE_global_directives.md`\n   - This compiled file is symlinked as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`\n\n3. **Why this approach?**\n   - Keeps different directive categories organized in separate files\n   - Makes it easy to enable/disable specific directives (rename to `.disabled`)\n   - Version control tracks changes to individual directive categories\n   - Compilation creates a single file that Claude reads at startup\n\n### Note About Claude's @-Mention Feature\n\n**Claude Code now supports @-mentioning files directly**, which might make this compilation approach unnecessary. You could potentially:\n- Keep directives in separate files\n- @-mention specific directive files when needed\n- Avoid the compilation step entirely\n\nI'm still investigating whether @-mentions fully replace the need for a compiled CLAUDE.md. For now, my compilation system works reliably.\n\n## Creating Your Own Configuration Repository\n\n**Want to create your own version-controlled Claude configuration?** Here's how I organize mine:\n\n### Starting Your Own\n\n1. **Create Your Repository**\n   ```bash\n   # Start fresh with your own structure\n   mkdir ~/my-claude-config\n   cd ~/my-claude-config\n   git init\n   \n   # Create the folders you need\n   mkdir agents commands hooks output-styles directives utils\n   ```\n\n2. **Build Your Components**\n   - Start with one or two agents/slash commands you'll actually use\n   - Test them by copying to `~/.claude/` first\n   - Once they work, commit them to your repo\n   - Gradually build up your collection\n\n3. **How I Sync Across Machines**\n   - I use symlinks from `~/.claude/` to my repo\n   - When I update the repo on one machine, I pull on others\n   - This keeps all my machines consistent\n   - You might prefer a different approach\n\n4. **Ideas for Your Configuration**\n   - **Automate what you do repeatedly** - That's what slash commands are for\n   - **Create agents for your review process** - Code review, security, docs\n   - **Add hooks for your common mistakes** - Prevent errors before they happen\n   - **Build your own directives** - Your coding standards, not mine\n\n### Best Practices for Your Configuration\n\n- **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 agents and slash commands, grow organically\n- **Document Everything**: Each component should explain its purpose\n- **Version Control**: Commit your customizations for team sharing\n- **Test First**: Verify components work before team-wide deployment\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **[Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical design and structure  \n- **[Terminal Colors](docs/TERMINAL_COLORS.md)** - Workarounds for Claude Code color rendering\n- **[Research & Patterns](resources/)** - Collected learnings and experiments\n\n"
