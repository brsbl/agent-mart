        "README.md": "# Android Reverse Engineering & API Extraction — Claude Code skill\n\nA Claude Code skill that decompiles Android APK/XAPK/JAR/AAR files and **extracts the HTTP APIs** used by the app — Retrofit endpoints, OkHttp calls, hardcoded URLs, authentication patterns — so you can document and reproduce them without the original source code.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **Decompiles** APK, XAPK, JAR, and AAR files using jadx and Fernflower/Vineflower (single engine or side-by-side comparison)\n- **Extracts and documents APIs**: Retrofit endpoints, OkHttp calls, hardcoded URLs, auth headers and tokens\n- **Traces call flows** from Activities/Fragments through ViewModels and repositories down to HTTP calls\n- **Analyzes** app structure: manifest, packages, architecture patterns\n- **Handles obfuscated code**: strategies for navigating ProGuard/R8 output\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Required:**\n- Java JDK 17+\n- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) (CLI)\n\n**Optional (recommended):**\n- [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower) or [Fernflower](https://github.com/JetBrains/fernflower) — better output on complex Java code\n- [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar) — needed to use Fernflower on APK/DEX files\n\nSee `plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/references/setup-guide.md` for detailed installation instructions.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From GitHub (recommended)\n\nInside Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill\n/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill\n```\n\nThe skill will be permanently available in all future sessions.\n\n### From a local clone\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill.git\n```\n\nThen in Claude Code:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/android-reverse-engineering-skill\n/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Slash command\n\n```\n/decompile path/to/app.apk\n```\n\nThis runs the full workflow: dependency check, decompilation, and initial structure analysis.\n\n### Natural language\n\nThe skill activates on phrases like:\n\n- \"Decompile this APK\"\n- \"Reverse engineer this Android app\"\n- \"Extract API endpoints from this app\"\n- \"Follow the call flow from LoginActivity\"\n- \"Analyze this AAR library\"\n\n### Manual scripts\n\nThe scripts can also be used standalone:\n\n```bash\n# Check dependencies\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/check-deps.sh\n\n# Install a missing dependency (auto-detects OS and package manager)\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh jadx\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh vineflower\n\n# Decompile APK with jadx (default)\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app.apk\n\n# Decompile XAPK (auto-extracts and decompiles each APK inside)\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app-bundle.xapk\n\n# Decompile with Fernflower\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine fernflower library.jar\n\n# Run both engines and compare\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine both --deobf app.apk\n\n# Find API calls\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --retrofit\nbash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --urls\n```\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nandroid-reverse-engineering-skill/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json                    #
