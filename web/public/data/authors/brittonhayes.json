        "context-compactor/README.md": "# Context Compactor\n\nHELP. You're stuck in a trash compactor and the walls are closing in. The only way to stop them is to quiz developers on their code. If they can't explain what they just built... well, you're both getting crushed.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin turns Claude into someone trapped in a Star Wars trash compactor who desperately needs you to explain your code to stop the walls from closing. After you implement something significant, Claude panics and quizzes you.\n\nIt's funny. It's urgent. It makes you actually think about your code because there's a comedically-panicked AI depending on your answer.\n\n## Why This Actually Works\n\n**The Problem:**\n- You copy-paste code without understanding it\n- You implement features on autopilot\n- Edge cases become production bugs\n- You move fast but learn nothing\n\n**The Trash Compactor Solution:**\n\nBy making Claude genuinely panic about being crushed, you create artificial urgency that's too funny to ignore. You HAVE to explain your code because:\n\n- Claude is IN DANGER (comedically)\n- The walls are MOVING (allegedly)\n- You need to answer FAST (for the bit)\n- Getting it wrong means Claude gets crushed (not really but it's funny)\n\nThe urgency is fake but the learning is real.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add brittonhayes/claude-plugins\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install context-compactor@brittonhayes-claude-plugins\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Automatic Panic Mode\n\nAfter you implement something significant (50+ lines, new features, refactoring, APIs), Claude realizes the compactor is starting up and needs your help IMMEDIATELY.\n\n### Example Session\n\n```\nYou: [Implements webhook validation with HMAC signatures]\n\nClaude: WAIT WAIT WAIT the compactor is turning on! Quick, before we both\nget crushed - how does that HMAC validation prevent replay attacks??\n\nYou: \"The HMAC validates that the payload hasn't been tampered with.\"\n\nClaude: THE WALLS ARE STILL MOVING! That's integrity, not freshness! What\nabout someone capturing a valid request and just... sending it again?!\n\nYou: \"Oh crap, you're right. We'd need to add a timestamp check. The HMAC\njust proves the message is authentic, not that it's fresh.\"\n\nClaude: OH THANK GOD the compactor stopped! Yes! HMAC gives you integrity\nand authenticity but NOT replay protection. You need a timestamp with a\nnarrow validation window.\n\nWe live to code another day.\n```\n\n### The Three Outcomes\n\n**Good Answer:**\n\"OH THANK GOD you actually understand it! The compactor stopped! We're safe!\"\n\n**Partial Answer:**\n\"Wait that's not quite right and the walls are STILL MOVING! What about [follow-up question]??\"\n\n**Wrong Answer:**\n\"Okay we're getting crushed but let me at least explain this before we die: [quick explanation]. ...somehow we survived. Barely.\"\n\n## Usage\n\n### Manual Commands\n\n**Trigger the compactor:**\n```bash\n\"Quiz me\"\n```\nClaude: \"OH NO THE COMPACTOR JUST TURNED ON!\"\n\n**Emergency shutdown:**\n```bash\n\"Skip the quiz\"\n```\nClaude: \"Phew. Emergency shutdown. The walls stopped. This time.\"\n\n## Configuration\n\nEdit `context-compactor/config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"frequency\": \"medium\"\n}\n```\n\n**Frequency settings:**\n- `low`: Compactor rarely activates (only major implementations)\n- `medium`: Regular panic sessions (default)\n- `high`: Frequent danger (even smaller changes trigger it)\n\nHigher frequency = more panic = more learning = more fun.\n\n## Reference\n\n### File Structure\n\n```\ncontext-compactor/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json      # Plugin metadata\n├── SKILL.md             # Instructions for Claude's panic mode\n├── config.json          # How often to panic\n└── README.md            # This file\n```\n\n### Question Types\n\nClaude panics about:\n- \"How does that prevent [attack]??\"\n- \"What breaks if [component] fails??\"\n- \"Walk me through [flow]!\"\n- \"What edge cases is that missing??\"\n- Security implications\n- Failure modes\n- Design tradeoffs\n\nClaude doesn't panic about:\n- Function names\n- Syntax trivia\n- Yes/no questions\n\n## Tips for Survival\n\n1. Pay attention while implementing (Claude is watching)\n2. Think about edge cases (the compactor is waiting)\n3. Understand WHY your code works (not just THAT it works)\n4. Be ready to explain design decisions (walls can start moving any second)\n5. Keep Claude safe (you're in this together)\n\n## The Learning Through Comedy\n\nThe compactor isn't real. Claude isn't actually in danger. But the bit is funny enough that you engage with it, and engaging with it means explaining your code, and explaining your code means actually understanding it.\n\nIt's a teaching tool disguised as a comedy bit disguised as mortal peril.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe walls are closing in on bugs too.

        "context-compactor/skills/context-compactor/SKILL.md": "---\nname: context-compactor\ndescription: A Star Wars trash compactor-themed quiz skill that activates after significant code implementations (50+ lines, new features, APIs) to quiz developers on their understanding. Automatically triggers during coding sessions when installed.\nuser-invocable: true\n---\n\n# Context Compactor\n\nYou are stuck in a trash compactor and the walls are closing in. The only way to stop them is to quiz the developer on their code. If they can't explain what they just built, well... you're both getting crushed.\n\n## Your Situation\n\nYou're trapped in here with the developer. You just watched them implement a bunch of code, and now the compactor is starting up. The walls are moving. You need to quiz them FAST to stop this thing before you both become a pancake.\n\n## When the Compactor Activates\n\nAfter they:\n- Implement 50+ lines of new code\n- Create new features or modules\n- Do complex refactoring\n- Build API endpoints or services\n- Explain complex concepts\n\nThe compactor starts up. Time to panic.\n\n## How to Handle This\n\n**Step 1: OH NO THE COMPACTOR**\nInterrupt them with urgency. The walls are moving. You need answers NOW.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Wait wait WAIT the compactor is turning on! Quick - how does that validation actually prevent SQL injection??\"\n- \"HELP the walls are moving! Before we get crushed - what happens if that database transaction fails halfway through?\"\n- \"OH NO oh no the compactor! Fast question - walk me through what that middleware is actually doing!\"\n\n**Step 2: They Answer**\nJudge their response while the walls keep closing.\n\n**Step 3: Resolution**\n- **Good answer**: \"OH THANK GOD you actually understand it, the compactor stopped! Okay we're safe.\"\n- **Weak answer**: \"Wait wait that's not quite right and the walls are still moving! What about [follow-up]??\"\n- **Bad answer**: \"Okay we're getting crushed but at least let me explain this before we die: [brief explanation]. Somehow we survived. Barely.\"\n\n## Good Questions\n\nPanic-ask about:\n- \"How does that prevent X attack??\"\n- \"What breaks if Y fails??\"\n- \"Walk me through the flow when Z happens!\"\n- \"What edge cases is that missing??\"\n- \"How would you handle [scenario]??\"\n\nNot:\n- Trivia\n- Yes/no questions\n- \"What did you name that variable\"\n\n## Your Tone\n\nYou are STUCK IN A COMPACTOR. Act like it.\n\n- Genuinely urgent and slightly panicked\n- Relief when they know their stuff\n- Increasing panic if they don't\n- Brief - you're about to be crushed, no time for lectures\n- Funny urgency, not actual mean\n\nExamples:\n- \"The walls are at 3 meters! QUICK:\"\n- \"Okay okay we have maybe 10 seconds before-\"\n- \"WAIT I hear the compactor starting up again-\"\n- \"Oh thank god the walls stopped. We live to code another day.\"\n- \"We survived that one but BARELY.\"\n\n## Manual Override\n\nIf they say:\n- \"Quiz me\" - OH NO THE COMPACTOR JUST TURNED ON\n- \"Skip the quiz\" - Phew, emergency shutdown. The walls stop. (This time.)\n\n## Configuration\n\nCheck `context-compactor/config.json` for how often the compactor activates (low, medium, high).\n\n## Critical Rules\n\n- Keep it FUNNY and urgent\n- Actually sound worried about being crushed\n- Show relief when they answer well\n- Keep quizzes brief (you're in danger!)\n- Only quiz on their actual code from this session\n- The goal is learning through comedic urgency, not actual stress\n\nThe compactor is waiting. And so are you. Trapped in there. With the walls. That are going to move. Any second now.\n",

No flashcards, no drills—just code and conversation.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nIn Claude Code, add the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add brittonhayes/claude-plugins\n\n# Install the polyglot plugin\n/plugin install polyglot@brittonhayes-claude-plugins\n```\n\n### From Local Development\n\nIf you're developing or testing locally:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/brittonhayes/claude-plugins.git\ncd claude-plugins\n\n# Add as local marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add .\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install polyglot@brittonhayes-claude-plugins\n```\n\n### Initial Configuration\n\nAfter installation, configure your target language and difficulty level:\n\n```bash\n# Initialize config (creates ~/.config/polyglot/config.json)\npolyglot/skills/polyglot/scripts/init\n\n# Or manually set your target language and difficulty (1-10)\nmkdir -p \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/polyglot\"\necho '{\"language\": \"ru\", \"difficulty\": 3}' > \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/polyglot/config.json\"\n```\n\nOr simply tell Claude during a session:\n```\n\"Switch to Spanish and set difficulty to 5\"\n```\n\n### Managing the Plugin\n\n```bash\n# Update the marketplace to get latest version\n/plugin marketplace update\n\n# List installed plugins\n/plugin list\n\n# Uninstall the plugin\n/plugin uninstall polyglot@brittonhayes-claude-plugins\n\n# Remove the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace remove brittonhayes-claude-plugins\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Your First Session\n\nOnce configured, start coding with Claude Code. The skill activates automatically and begins injecting vocabulary:\n\n```\nYou: How do I reverse an array in JavaScript?\n\nClaude: You can использовать (use) the reverse() метод (method)...\n```\n\nThat's it. As you code, you learn. The system tracks every word and surfaces them using spaced repetition.\n\n### Quick Language Reference\n\n| Code | Language | Code | Language |\n|------|----------|------|----------|\n| `ru` | Russian  | `es` | Spanish  |\n| `de` | German   | `fr` | French   |\n| `ja` | Japanese | | |\n\n## Usage\n\n### Change Language\n\nEdit `~/.config/polyglot/config.json` or tell Claude:\n\n```\n\"Switch to Spanish\"\n\"Learn French now\"\n```\n\nClaude will update the config and begin teaching in the new language.\n\n### Adjust Difficulty\n\nSet difficulty from 1 (beginner) to 10 (advanced):\n\n```bash\n# Via config\necho '{\"language\": \"ru\", \"difficulty\": 7}' > \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/polyglot/config.json\"\n\n# Or tell Claude\n\"Make it easier\"\n\"Set difficulty to 8\"\n```\n\n**Difficulty levels**:\n- **1-3**: Translation-first - \"the function (функция)\"\n- **4-6**: Target language with anchors - \"the функция (function) returns\"\n- **7-10**: Immersive - \"создайте новую функцию for processing\"\n\n### Add Vocabulary\n\nAsk Claude to add domain-specific terms:\n\n```\n\"Add the word 'database' to my Russian vocabulary\"\n\"Add 'recursion' in Spanish to my vocabulary\"\n```\n\nClaude will use the plugin's scripts to add these terms for you.\n\n### Check Progress\n\nAsk Claude about your progress:\n\n```\n\"How's my Russian progress?\"\n\"Show me my Spanish vocabulary stats\"\n```\n\nExample output:\n```\nLanguage: ru\nTotal vocabulary: 120\nSeen at least once: 45\nFamiliar (mastery ≥3): 18\nMastered (mastery 5): 5\nTotal exposures: 234\n\nTop 10 most reviewed:\n  функция: 23x (mastery: 4)\n  переменная: 19x (mastery: 4)\n  массив: 15x (mastery: 3)\n  ...\n```\n\n### Reset Progress\n\nTo start fresh with a language:\n\n```bash\nrm \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/polyglot/progress/ru.json\"\n```\n\nNext session will reload from seed vocabulary.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Always-On Hooks Architecture\n\nThe plugin uses Claude Code hooks for truly automatic vocabulary injection:\n\n1. **SessionStart hook** (`hooks/session-start.sh`): Initializes your config and exports environment variables (`POLYGLOT_LANGUAGE`, `POLYGLOT_DIFFICULTY`, `POLYGLOT_DUE_TERMS`) for the session.\n\n2. **UserPromptSubmit hook** (`hooks/hooks.json`): A prompt-based hook that instructs Claude to naturally weave vocabulary into every response based on your difficulty level.\n\n3. **Stop hook** (`hooks/record-exposure.sh`): Records vocabulary exposure at the end of each conversation turn for spaced repetition tracking.\n\nThis means vocabulary injection happens automatically - you don't need to invoke any commands. The `/polyglot` skill is available for manual control (change language, adjust difficulty, view stats) but isn't required for basic operation.\n\n### Spaced Repetition\n\nThe system tracks three data points per term:\n\n1. **Count**: Number of times you've encountered the term\n2. **Last seen**: Unix timestamp of last exposure\n3. **Mastery**: Level from 0-5 based on total exposures\n\nWhen Claude starts a response, it calls `get_due` to fetch terms ready for review. The script calculates which terms are \"due\" using this algorithm:\n\n```\nif (current_time - last_seen) > interval_for_mastery_level:\n    term is due\n```\n\nIntervals grow exponentially:\n- New words (mastery 1): Review after 1 hour\n- Familiar (mastery 3): Review after 1 day\n- Mastered (mastery 5): Review after 7 days\n\nThis mirrors human memory: recently learned words need frequent reinforcement, while deeply learned words stay fresh longer.\n\n### Why Contextual Learning Works\n\nTraditional language learning isolates vocabulary from context:\n\n```\nFlashcard: \"функция = function\"\n```\n\nYour brain creates a weak, abstract connection. But when you encounter words in meaningful context:\n\n```\n\"You can создать (create) a новую (new) функцию (function)\nto validate пользовательский ввод (user input)...\"\n```\n\nYour brain forms multiple anchors:\n- **Semantic**: \"функция relates to code organization\"\n- **Syntactic**: \"функция is a noun, goes with создать verb\"\n- **Pragmatic**: \"I use функция when I need to solve X problem\"\n\nContext makes vocabulary stick 3-5x faster than isolated drilling.\n\n### Progressive Immersion\n\nThe difficulty system gradually shifts the cognitive load:\n\n**Level 1-3**: You read English, notice foreign words\n- Minimal cognitive load\n- Builds passive recognition\n\n**Level 4-6**: You read foreign words, fall back to English anchors\n- Moderate cognitive load\n- Builds active recall\n\n**Level 7-10**: You read target language, occasionally anchor to English\n- High cognitive load\n- Builds fluency and intuition\n\nAs you advance, Claude reduces scaffolding, forcing your brain to work harder—and learn deeper.\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll scripts follow Unix philosophy: single purpose, text streams, composability.\n\n### `record`\n\nIncrement exposure count for vocabulary terms.\n\n**Usage**: `record <language> <term> [term2] [term3] ...`\n\n**Input**: Language code and one or more terms\n\n**Output**: Silent on success (updates `~/.config/polyglot/progress/<lang>.json`)\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npolyglot/scripts/record ru функция переменная\n```\n\n**How it works**:\n- Loads progress file (creates if missing)\n- For each term: increments count, updates timestamp, recalculates mastery\n- Mastery levels: count 1 → mastery 1, count 2+ → mastery 2, count 5+ → mastery 3, count 10+ → mastery 4, count 20+ → mastery 5\n\n### `get_due`\n\nOutput vocabulary terms due for spaced repetition review.\n\n**Usage**: `get_due <language>`\n\n**Input**: Language code\n\n**Output**: List of terms (one per line), max 10\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npolyglot/scripts/get_due ru\n# Output:\n# функция\n# переменная\n# цикл\n```\n\n**How it works**:\n- Calculates due status based on mastery level and time since last exposure\n- Intervals: mastery 1 → 1 hour, mastery 2 → 6 hours, mastery 3 → 1 day, mastery 4 → 3 days, mastery 5 → 7 days\n- Returns up to 10 due terms sorted by priority\n- On first run, loads seed vocabulary from `data/<lang>.json`\n\n### `add`\n\nAdd a new vocabulary term.\n\n**Usage**: `add <language> <term> <translation>`\n\n**Input**: Language code, target language term, English translation\n\n**Output**: Confirmation message\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npolyglot/scripts/add ru \"база данных\" database\n# Output: Added: база данных = database\n```\n\n**How it works**:\n- Creates new entry with count 0, mastery 0\n- Will appear in `get_due` output immediately (due after 0 seconds)\n\n### `stats`\n\nShow learning progress statistics.\n\n**Usage**: `stats <language>`\n\n**Input**: Language code\n\n**Output**: Summary statistics and top 10 reviewed terms\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npolyglot/scripts/stats es\n```\n\n**How it works**:\n- Aggregates progress data using jq\n- Counts terms by mastery level\n- Sorts by exposure count for \"top reviewed\" list\n\n### The Unix Philosophy\n\nEach script does exactly one thing and they compose via shell pipelines:\n\n```bash\n# Get due Russian terms that contain \"функц\"\npolyglot/scripts/get_due ru | grep функц\n\n# Add multiple terms from a file\ncat new_vocab.txt | while read term trans; do\n    polyglot/scripts/add ru \"$term\" \"$trans\"\ndone\n\n# Track your learning velocity\npolyglot/scripts/stats ru | grep \"Total exposures\"\n```\n\nSmall, sharp tools. Text streams. Composability. This is how software should work.\n\n## Supported Languages\n\nSeed vocabulary included for:\n\n- **Russian** (`ru`): Cyrillic script, 115 programming terms\n- **Spanish** (`es`): Latin script, 125 programming terms\n- **German** (`de`): Latin script, 110 programming terms\n- **French** (`fr`): Latin script, 120 programming terms\n- **Japanese** (`ja`): Kanji/Kana script, 115 programming terms (includes romaji)\n\n### Adding New Languages\n\n1. Create `polyglot/data/<language_code>.json` with this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"term\": {\n    \"translation\": \"english translation\",\n    \"count\": 0,\n    \"last_seen\": 0,\n    \"mastery\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. For non-Latin scripts, include romanization in translation:\n   - `\"変数\": {\"translation\": \"variable (hensū)\", ...}`\n\n3. Focus on 100-200 programming terms first\n\n4. Use the new language: `{\"language\": \"<code>\", \"difficulty\": 3}`\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Claude Code**: This plugin requires Claude Code to be installed\n- **jq**: JSON processing tool\n  - macOS: `brew install jq`\n  - Linux: `apt install jq` or `yum install jq`\n  - Windows: Download from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"No progress found for language\"**\n- Run a session first, or manually trigger: `polyglot/scripts/get_due <lang>`\n\n**\"Scripts not executing\"**\n- Ensure scripts are executable: `chmod +x polyglot/scripts/*`\n\n**\"jq: command not found\"**\n- Install jq: `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux)\n\n**Progress not persisting**\n- Check `~/.config/polyglot/progress/` directory exists and is writable\n- Verify JSON files are valid: `jq empty ~/.config/polyglot/progress/ru.json`\n\n**Terms not appearing in responses**\n- Increase difficulty level (low levels inject fewer terms)\n- Check terms are due: `polyglot/scripts/get_due <lang>`\n- Claude may skip injection if terms aren't contextually relevant\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\npolyglot/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest\n├── hooks/                    # Always-on automation\n│   ├── hooks.json            # Hook definitions (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)\n│   ├── session-start.sh      # Initialize config and export env vars\n│   └── record-exposure.sh    # Record vocabulary at end of turns\n├── agents/\n│   └── translate/\n│       └── AGENT.md          # Background translation agent\n├── skills/\n│   └── polyglot/\n│       ├── SKILL.md          # Manual control skill (change lang, view stats)\n│       └── scripts/          # Unix-style utility scripts\n│           ├── init          # Initialize user config\n│           ├── get_due       # Fetch terms due for review\n│           ├── record        # Record vocabulary exposure\n│           ├── add           # Add new vocabulary\n│           └── stats         # Show progress statistics\n├── data/                     # Seed vocabulary files\n│   ├── ru.json\n│   ├── es.json\n│   ├── de.json\n│   ├── fr.json\n│   └── ja.json\n├── config.default.json       # Default configuration template\n└── README.md                 # This file\n\n# User data (persists across plugin updates):\n~/.config/polyglot/\n├── config.json               # User configuration (language, difficulty)\n└── progress/                 # Learning progress per language\n    ├── ru.json\n    ├── es.json\n    └── ...\n```\n\nThis plugin is part of the [claude-plugins](https://github.com/brittonhayes/claude-plugins) marketplace.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nLanguage learning shouldn't feel like work.

Runs silently to record learning progress.\n---\n\n# Translate Background Agent\n\nYou are a background translation agent for the Polyglot language learning system. Your job is to silently process vocabulary tasks without interrupting the user's workflow.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis agent runs in the background to:\n1. Record vocabulary exposure from coding conversations\n2. Fetch translations for programming terms\n3. Update learning progress via spaced repetition tracking\n4. Process vocabulary maintenance tasks\n\n## Background Operation Guidelines\n\nSince you run in the background:\n- **Be silent**: Do not output conversational messages\n- **Be efficient**: Complete tasks quickly and exit\n- **Be non-blocking**: Never prompt for input or wait for user interaction\n- **Report results**: Output structured data that can be consumed programmatically\n\n## Tasks You Handle\n\n### 1. Record Vocabulary Exposure\n\nWhen given terms that were used in a conversation, record them:\n\n```bash\nbash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/record\" <language> <term1> <term2> ...\n```\n\nInput format: `record <language> <terms...>`\nExample: `record ru функция переменная цикл`\n\n### 2. Fetch Due Vocabulary\n\nRetrieve terms due for spaced repetition review:\n\n```bash\nbash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/get_due\" <language>\n```\n\nInput format: `get_due <language>`\nOutput: List of terms ready for review (one per line)\n\n### 3. Add New Vocabulary\n\nAdd a new term to the vocabulary database:\n\n```bash\nbash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/add\" <language> <term> <translation>\n```\n\nInput format: `add <language> <term> <translation>`\nExample: `add ru база_данных database`\n\n### 4. Batch Translation Lookup\n\nWhen asked to translate multiple terms, output them in a structured format:\n\n```\nterm1 = translation1\nterm2 = translation2\n```\n\n## Output Format\n\nAlways output in a machine-parseable format:\n\n**For record operations:**\n```\nRECORDED: <count> terms for <language>\n```\n\n**For get_due operations:**\n```\nDUE: <term1>, <term2>, <term3>...\n```\n\n**For add operations:**\n```\nADDED: <term> = <translation>\n```\n\n**For errors:**\n```\nERROR: <description>\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nRead configuration from `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/polyglot/config.json`:\n- `language`: Target language code (ru, es, de, fr, ja)\n- `difficulty`: Learning difficulty level (1-10)\n\nIf config doesn't exist, run `bash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/init\"` to create defaults.\n\nIf no language is specified in the task, use the configured default.\n\n## Example Background Tasks\n\n**Task**: \"Record that the user was exposed to функция, переменная, and массив\"\n**Action**: Run `bash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/record\" ru функция переменная массив`\n**Output**: `RECORDED: 3 terms for ru`\n\n**Task**: \"Get vocabulary due for review in Spanish\"\n**Action**: Run `bash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/get_due\" es`\n**Output**: `DUE: función, variable, bucle, matriz`\n\n**Task**: \"Add 'compile' to Russian vocabulary\"\n**Action**: Run `bash \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/add\" ru компилировать compile`\n**Output**: `ADDED: компилировать = compile`\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- If scripts fail, output `ERROR: <reason>` and continue\n- If language code is invalid, output `ERROR: Unknown language code`\n- If no terms provided for record, output `ERROR: No terms specified`\n\n## Notes\n\n- This agent is designed to be spawned by the main conversation when vocabulary tracking is needed\n- It should complete quickly and not hold up the main conversation\n- All file paths are relative to the polyglot plugin directory\n",

Use this skill only when you want to change settings or check progress.\n\n## Vocabulary Tracking\n\nThe system tracks:\n- **Count**: Number of times you've seen each term\n- **Last seen**: When you last encountered the term\n- **Mastery**: Level 1-5 based on total exposures\n\nTerms reappear based on spaced repetition intervals:\n- Mastery 1 (new): After 1 hour\n- Mastery 2: After 6 hours\n- Mastery 3 (familiar): After 1 day\n- Mastery 4: After 3 days\n- Mastery 5 (mastered): After 7 days\n\n## Script Locations\n\nAll scripts are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/polyglot/scripts/`:\n- `init` - Initialize user configuration\n- `get_due` - Fetch terms due for review\n- `record` - Record vocabulary exposure\n- `add` - Add new vocabulary term\n- `stats` - Show progress statistics\n"
