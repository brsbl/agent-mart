It's the start of a new era for headless CMS.\n\n<h3>Benefits over a regular CMS</h3>\n<ul>\n   <li>It's both an app framework & headless CMS</li>\n  <li>Deploy anywhere, including serverless on Vercel for free</li>\n  <li>Combine your front+backend in the same <code>/app</code> folder if you want</li>\n  <li>Don't sign up for yet another SaaS - Payload is open source</li>\n  <li>Query your database in React Server Components</li>\n  <li>Both admin and backend are 100% extensible</li>\n  <li>No vendor lock-in</li>\n  <li>Never touch ancient WP code again</li>\n  <li>Build faster, never hit a roadblock</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Quickstart\n\nBefore beginning to work with Payload, make sure you have all of the [required software](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation).\n\n```text\npnpx create-payload-app@latest\n```\n\n**If you're new to Payload, you should start with the website template** (`pnpx create-payload-app@latest -t website`). It shows how to do _everything_ - including custom Rich Text blocks, on-demand revalidation, live preview, and more. It comes with a frontend built with Tailwind all in one `/app` folder.\n\n## One-click deployment options\n\nYou can deploy Payload serverlessly in one-click via Vercel and Cloudflare—giving everything you need without the hassle of the plumbing.\n\n### Deploy on Cloudflare\n\nFully self-contained — one click to deploy Payload with **Workers**, **R2** for uploads, and **D1** for a globally replicated database.\n\n[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://dub.sh/payload-cloudflare)\n\n### Deploy on Vercel\n\nAll-in-one on Vercel — one click to deploy Payload with a **Next.js** front end, **Neon** database, and **Vercel Blob** for media storage.\n\n[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://dub.sh/payload-vercel)\n\n## One-click templates\n\nJumpstart your next project with a ready-to-go template.
