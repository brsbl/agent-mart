We do accept bug fixes, documentation improvements, and small, well-scoped extensions. Supporting larger extensions, feature requests, or support with custom integration and deployment scenarios are out of scope.\n\nFor more details see [support](SUPPORT.md) and [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

        "clients/claude-code/README.md": "# Nuanced LSP plugin for Claude Code\n\nPlugin to use the Nuanced LSP server with Claude Code.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Nuanced LSP:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g @nuanced-dev/lsp\n```\n\nAdd the Nuanced marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add nuanced-dev/lsp\nclaude plugin install lsp@nuanced-dev\n```\n\nStart using the LSP tool in Claude Code.\n\n## Caveats\n\n- The plugin requires that Claude Code is started in the project root, otherwise the LSP workspace will be incorrect.\n\n- Some people report that the LSP tool only works when running Claude Code thropugh NPM, not when using the native binaries.\n\n## More Information\n\nSee [@nuanced-dev/lsp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuanced-dev/lsp) package.\n"
