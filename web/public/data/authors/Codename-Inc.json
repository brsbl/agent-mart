Capture learnings from conversations and automatically recall them when relevant.\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace and install plugin\n/plugin marketplace add Codename-Inc/spectre-labs/sparks\n/plugin install sparks@spectre-labs\n```\n\n## Why Separate?\n\nThese features are:\n- **Experimental** — APIs may change\n- **Power-user oriented** — Require more setup\n- **Not core to SPECTRE** — You can use SPECTRE workflow without them\n\nThe main [SPECTRE](https://github.com/Codename-Inc/spectre) repo contains the stable workflow framework.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
