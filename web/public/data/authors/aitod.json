Claude reviews and presents the results.\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/gemini <task description>\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Background delegation to Gemini CLI\n- Claude reviews output before presenting\n- Quality control and assessment\n\n## Adding New Plugins\n\n1. Create a new folder under `plugins/`\n2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to your plugin\n3. Add your plugin to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n",
        "plugins/gemini-delegate/README.md": "# Gemini Delegate Plugin\n\nIntegrate Gemini CLI as a subagent that Claude can delegate work to without interrupting the current workflow.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Background delegation**: Send tasks to Gemini while Claude continues working\n- **Full transparency**: See exactly what Gemini is doing with status updates and logs\n- **Progress monitoring**: Check output file anytime to see current progress\n- **Error reporting**: Immediate notification if something fails, with detailed error info\n- **Review and present**: Claude reviews Gemini's output before presenting to user\n- **Quality control**: Claude assesses and validates Gemini's work\n- **Complete logging**: All output saved to file for later review\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Install Gemini CLI: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli\n2. Authenticate: `gemini auth login`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command: `/gemini <task>`\n\nDelegate a specific task to Gemini:\n\n```\n/gemini create a utility function to parse ISO dates\n/gemini refactor this function to use async/await\n/gemini add unit tests for the UserService class\n```\n\n### Automatic Delegation\n\nClaude may also use the gemini-worker agent internally to parallelize work when appropriate.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. You request a task via `/gemini` or Claude decides to delegate\n2. The gemini-worker agent spawns **in the background** (non-blocking)\n3. **You get the output file path** - you can check progress anytime\n4. **Claude continues working** on other tasks while Gemini runs\n5. Gemini executes the task and produces output with status updates\n6. **You're notified** when Gemini completes (or if it fails)\n7. Claude checks results and reviews for correctness\n8. Claude presents a summary with assessment showing:\n   - ✓ SUCCESS or ✗ FAILED status\n   - What was produced or why it failed\n   - Full output location for your review\n9. You decide whether to apply the changes\n\n**Key advantages**:\n- Claude doesn't wait idle - continues helping you with other tasks\n- **Full visibility** - check output file anytime to see what's happening\n- **Immediate error notification** - you're told right away if something fails\n- **Complete logs** - all output saved for later review\n\n## Components\n\n- `agents/gemini-worker.md` - Worker agent that executes Gemini CLI\n- `commands/gemini.md` - User command to delegate tasks\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is installed globally at:\n```\n~/.claude/plugins/gemini-delegate/\n```\n\nTo use, ensure Gemini CLI is installed and authenticated.\n"
