        "README.md": "# Flox Agentic Tools\n\nThis repository provides tools and integrations for AI agents to work with Flox, offering expert guidance and automation for Flox development environments, builds, services, and deployments.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project includes specialized knowledge and tooling for Flox workflows, best practices, and patterns. It provides a comprehensive set of skills covering the entire Flox development lifecycle, from environment setup to production deployment, accessible through multiple AI agent platforms.\n\n## Components\n\n### Flox MCP Server\n\nThe Flox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides agents with direct access to Flox functionality through structured tool interfaces. It enables seamless environment management and workflow automation with better guardrails, since all environment management happens through MCP tool commands and does not require `bash` access.\n\nThe MCP server uses the `stdio` transport, so there's no service that runs—as long as `flox-mcp` is on your PATH, it will work.\n\n### Skills Library\n\nThe repository includes seven specialized skills, each focused on a specific aspect of Flox:\n\n#### 1. **flox-environments**\nManage reproducible development environments with Flox. This is the foundational skill that should be used first when creating any new project. Covers:\n- Installing packages and managing dependencies\n- Python, Node.js, and Go environment setup\n- Environment configuration and secrets management\n- Reproducible development workflows\n\n#### 2. **flox-services**\nRunning services and background processes in Flox environments. Covers:\n- Service configuration and lifecycle management\n- Network services (HTTP servers, databases, etc.)\n- Logging and debugging patterns\n- Service orchestration\n\n#### 3. **flox-builds**\nBuilding and packaging applications with Flox. Covers:\n- Manifest builds for quick iteration\n- Nix expression builds for guaranteed reproducibility\n- Sandbox modes and build isolation\n- Multi-stage builds\n- Packaging assets and artifacts\n\n#### 4. **flox-containers**\nContainerizing Flox environments with Docker/Podman. Covers:\n- Creating container images from Flox environments\n- OCI exports\n- Multi-stage container builds\n- Deployment workflows\n\n#### 5. **flox-publish**\nPublishing packages to Flox for distribution and sharing. Covers:\n- Package publishing workflows\n- Organization and personal namespace management\n- Package versioning and distribution\n- Sharing built packages across teams\n\n#### 6. **flox-sharing**\nSharing and composing Flox environments. Covers:\n- Environment composition and layering\n- Remote environments via FloxHub\n- Team collaboration patterns\n- Reusable environment stacks\n\n#### 7. **flox-cuda**\nCUDA and GPU development with Flox (Linux only). Covers:\n- NVIDIA CUDA toolkit setup\n- GPU computing workflows\n- Deep learning framework integration\n- cuDNN configuration\n- Cross-platform GPU/CPU development\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Flox CLI installed and configured\n- For GPU development: Linux system with NVIDIA GPU (aarch64-linux or x86_64-linux)\n\n### Install the Flox MCP Server\n\nFirst, install the Flox MCP server package into an environment, ideally your default environment:\n\n```bash\nflox install flox/flox-mcp-server\n```\n\nOr you can make it available without installing by running the `flox/flox-mcp-server` remote environment:\n\n```bash\nflox activate -r flox/flox-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Application-Specific Setup\n\n#### Claude Code\n\nThe Flox plugin for Claude Code provides comprehensive Flox integration, including package management, environment composition, service orchestration, build system configuration, containerization, publishing, and CUDA support. The plugin includes both MCP server configuration and the Skills library as native Claude skills.\n\n**Install the Plugin:**\n\nFrom within Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add flox/flox-agentic\n/plugin install flox@flox-agentic\n```\n\nOr from the command line:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add flox/flox-agentic\nclaude plugin install flox@flox-agentic\n```\n\n**Configure MCP Server:**\n\nThe plugin handles MCP server configuration automatically when used. You can also configure it manually:\n\n```bash\n# Per project:\nclaude mcp add flox -- flox-mcp\n\n# Per user:\nclaude mcp add --scope user flox -- flox-mcp\n```\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\nOnce installed, the plugin automatically activates. Claude Code will use the appropriate skill based on your task:\n- Creating a new project? The **flox-environments** skill activates first\n- Setting up services? The **flox-services** skill provides guidance\n- Building packages? The **flox-builds** skill helps with manifest or Nix builds\n- Deploying containers? The **flox-containers** skill assists with containerization\n\n#### Cursor\n\nMake sure the MCP server is available (see \"Install the Flox MCP Server\" above), then add it to your MCP configuration file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"flox\": {\n      \"command\": \"flox-mcp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Kiro\n\nFor Kiro, create a configuration file in `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` for workspace-specific settings or `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` for user-wide settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"flox\": {\n      \"command\": \"flox-mcp\",\n      \"args\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Other Agents\n\nThe Flox MCP server can be used with any agent that supports the Model Context Protocol. Configure it according to your agent's MCP configuration requirements, ensuring `flox-mcp` is available in your PATH.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor detailed documentation on each skill, see the individual SKILL.md files in the `skills/` directory:\n- `skills/flox-environments/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-services/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-builds/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-containers/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-publish/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-sharing/SKILL.md`\n- `skills/flox-cuda/SKILL.md`\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
