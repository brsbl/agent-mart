Checkpoint-based resume (`--resume`) validates artifact integrity with SHA-256 hashes. Feature branches auto-created when on main.\n\n## Mend Mode (Finding Resolution)\n\nWhen you run `/rune:mend`, Rune parses structured findings from a TOME and fixes them in parallel:\n\n1. **Parses TOME** — extracts findings with session nonce validation\n2. **Groups by file** — prevents concurrent edits to the same file\n3. **Summons fixers** — restricted mend-fixer agents (no Bash, no TeamCreate)\n4. **Monitors progress** — stale detection, 15-minute timeout\n5. **Runs ward check** — once after all fixers complete (not per-fixer)\n5.5. **Doc-consistency scan** — fixes drift between source-of-truth files and downstream targets (single pass, Edit-based)\n6. **Produces report** — FIXED/FALSE_POSITIVE/FAILED/SKIPPED/CONSISTENCY_FIX categories\n\nSEC-prefix findings require human approval for FALSE_POSITIVE marking.\n\n## What It Does\n\nWhen you run `/rune:review`, Rune:\n\n1. **Detects scope** — classifies changed files by extension\n2. **Selects Ash** — picks the right reviewers (2-8 Ashes)\n3. **Summons Agent Teams** — each reviewer gets its own 200k context window\n4. **Reviews in parallel** — Ash review simultaneously, writing to files\n5. **Aggregates findings** — Runebinder deduplicates and prioritizes\n6. **Verifies evidence** — Truthsight validates P1 findings against source\n7. **Presents TOME** — unified review summary\n\n## Audit Mode\n\nWhen you run `/rune:audit`, Rune scans your entire codebase instead of just changed files:\n\n1. **Scans codebase** — finds all project files (excluding binaries, lock files, build output)\n2. **Classifies files** — same Rune Gaze extension-based classification\n3. **Selects Ash** — same 2-8 Ashes selection\n4. **Audits in parallel** — each Ash gets capped context budget, prioritized by importance\n5. **Aggregates findings** — Runebinder deduplicates and prioritizes\n6. **Presents TOME** — unified audit summary with coverage gaps\n\nUnlike `/rune:review` (changed files only), `/rune:audit` does not require git. Each Ash's context budget limits how many files it processes, prioritized by architectural importance.\n\n## Plan Mode\n\nWhen you run `/rune:plan`, Rune orchestrates a multi-agent research pipeline:\n\n1. **Gathers input** — runs interactive brainstorm by default (auto-skips when requirements are clear)\n2. **Summons research agents** — 3-5 parallel agents explore best practices, codebase patterns, framework docs, and past echoes\n3. **Synthesizes findings** — lead consolidates research into a structured plan\n4. **Forge Gaze enrichment** — topic-aware agent selection matches plan sections to specialized agents by default using keyword overlap scoring. 13 agents (11 enrichment + 2 research) + 7 elicitation methods across enrichment (~5k tokens) and research (~15k tokens) budget tiers. Use `--exhaustive` for deeper research with lower thresholds. Use `--quick` to skip forge.\n5. **Reviews document** — Scroll Reviewer checks plan quality, with optional iterative refinement and technical review (decree-arbiter + knowledge-keeper)\n6. **Persists learnings** — saves planning insights to Rune Echoes\n\nOutput: `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{type}-{feature-name}-plan.md`\n\n## Work Mode\n\nWhen you run `/rune:work`, Rune parses a plan into tasks and summons self-organizing swarm workers:\n\n1. **Parses plan** — extracts tasks with dependencies, clarifies ambiguities via AskUserQuestion\n2. **Sets up environment** — branch safety check (warns on `main`), stash dirty files (Phase 0.5)\n3. **Creates task pool** — TaskCreate with dependency chains (blockedBy)\n4. **Summons workers** — Rune Smiths (implementation) and Trial Forgers (tests) claim tasks independently\n5. **Monitors progress** — polls TaskList, detects stalled workers, releases stuck tasks\n6. **Commits via broker** — orchestrator applies patches and commits (prevents index.lock contention)\n7. **Runs quality gates** — auto-discovers wards + post-ward verification checklist\n8. **Persists learnings** — saves implementation patterns to Rune Echoes\n9. **Cleans up** — shutdown workers, TeamDelete (Phase 6)\n10. **Ships (optional)** — push + PR creation with generated template (Phase 6.5)\n\nWorkers scale automatically based on task count (1-5 tasks: 2 workers, 20+ tasks: 5 workers).\n\nNew talisman work keys: `skip_branch_check`, `branch_prefix`, `pr_monitoring`, `co_authors`. Reserved for a future release: `pr_template`, `auto_push`. See [`talisman.example.yml`](talisman.example.yml) for defaults.\n\n## Codex Oracle (Cross-Model Verification)\n\nWhen the `codex` CLI is installed, Rune automatically detects it and adds **Codex Oracle** as a 6th built-in Ash. Codex Oracle provides cross-model verification — a second AI perspective (GPT-5.3-codex) alongside Claude Code's review agents — catching issues that single-model blind spots miss.\n\n### How It Works\n\n- **Review/Audit**: Codex Oracle joins the Roundtable Circle as a teammate, reviewing assigned files via `codex exec` in read-only sandbox mode. Its findings go through the standard TOME aggregation pipeline with `CDX-NNN` prefix.\n- **Plan**: Codex Oracle serves as both a research agent (Phase 1C) and an optional plan reviewer (Phase 4C) with `[CDX-PLAN-NNN]` findings.\n- **Work**: After ward checks pass, an optional Phase 4.5 advisory compares the implementation diff against the plan to catch semantic drift. Non-blocking `[CDX-WORK-NNN]` warnings.\n- **Forge**: Codex Oracle participates in Forge Gaze topic matching for plan enrichment.\n\n### Cross-Model Verification\n\nCodex findings go through a verification layer before entering the TOME:\n1. File existence check (does the referenced file exist?)\n2. Code snippet match (does the Rune Trace match actual code at the referenced line?)\n3. Cross-Ash correlation (did any Claude Ash flag the same issue? If so, confidence boost)\n4. Only CONFIRMED findings proceed; HALLUCINATED and UNVERIFIED findings are filtered out\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- `codex` CLI installed: `npm install -g @openai/codex`\n- OpenAI account with API access (Codex CLI handles authentication)\n- No Rune configuration needed — auto-detected when CLI is available\n\n### Configuration\n\n```yaml\n# .claude/talisman.yml\ncodex:\n  disabled: false                   # Set true to disable Codex Oracle entirely\n  model: \"gpt-5.3-codex\"           # Codex model (gpt-5-codex, gpt-5.2-codex, gpt-5.3-codex)\n  reasoning: \"high\"                 # Reasoning effort (high, medium, low)\n  sandbox: \"read-only\"              # Sandbox mode (always read-only for review)\n  context_budget: 20                # Max files to review (default: 20)\n  confidence_threshold: 80          # Min confidence to report finding (default: 80)\n  workflows: [review, audit, plan, forge, work]  # Which workflows use Codex Oracle\n  work_advisory:\n    enabled: true                   # Set false to skip advisory in work pipeline\n    max_diff_size: 15000            # Truncate diff to this many chars (default: 15000)\n  verification:\n    enabled: true                   # Cross-model verification (recommended: true)\n    fuzzy_match_threshold: 0.7      # Code snippet match threshold (0.0-1.0)\n    cross_model_bonus: 0.15         # Confidence boost when Claude+Codex agree\n```\n\nWhen Codex Oracle is disabled (via `codex.disabled: true`) or the CLI is not installed, all workflows proceed normally without it — no error, just an info-level log message.\n\n## Rune Echoes (Memory)\n\nRune Echoes is a project-level memory system stored in `.claude/echoes/`. After each review or audit, agents persist patterns and learnings. Future sessions read these echoes to avoid repeating mistakes.\n\n### 3-Layer Lifecycle\n\n| Layer | Name | Duration | Purpose |\n|-------|------|----------|---------|\n| Structural | **Etched** | Permanent | Architecture decisions, tech stack, key conventions |\n| Tactical | **Inscribed** | 90 days | Patterns from reviews/audits (N+1 queries, unused imports) |\n| Session | **Traced** | 30 days | Session-specific observations |\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. Run `/rune:echoes init` to set up memory directories\n2. Run `/rune:review` or `/rune:audit` — agents persist high-confidence findings\n3. Future workflows read echoes via the `echo-reader` agent\n4. Memory self-prunes: stale entries archive automatically\n\n### Memory Management\n\n```bash\n/rune:echoes show     # Display echo statistics per role\n/rune:echoes prune    # Score and archive stale entries\n/rune:echoes reset    # Clear all echoes (with backup)\n```\n\n## Ash\n\n| Ash | Role | When Active |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Forge Warden | Backend review | Backend files changed |\n| Ward Sentinel | Security review | Always |\n| Pattern Weaver | Quality patterns | Always |\n| Glyph Scribe | Frontend review | Frontend files changed |\n| Knowledge Keeper | Docs review | Docs changed (>= 10 lines) |\n| Codex Oracle | Cross-model review (GPT-5.3-codex) | `codex` CLI available |\n\n## Agents\n\n### Review Agents\n\n16 specialized agents that Ash embed as perspectives:\n\n| Agent | Focus |\n|-------|-------|\n| ward-sentinel | Security, OWASP, auth |\n| ember-oracle | Performance, N+1, complexity |\n| rune-architect | Architecture, layer boundaries |\n| simplicity-warden | YAGNI, over-engineering |\n| flaw-hunter | Logic bugs, edge cases |\n| mimic-detector | Code duplication |\n| pattern-seer | Pattern consistency |\n| void-analyzer | Incomplete implementations |\n| wraith-finder | Dead code |\n| phantom-checker | Dynamic references |\n| type-warden | Type safety, mypy compliance |\n| trial-oracle | TDD compliance, test quality |\n| depth-seer | Missing logic, complexity detection |\n| blight-seer | Design anti-patterns, architectural smells |\n| forge-keeper | Data integrity, migration safety |\n| tide-watcher | Async/concurrency patterns |\n\n### Research Agents\n\nSummoned during `/rune:plan` for parallel research:\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| practice-seeker | External best practices and industry patterns |\n| repo-surveyor | Codebase exploration and pattern discovery |\n| lore-scholar | Framework documentation and API research |\n| git-miner | Git history analysis and code archaeology |\n| echo-reader | Reads past Rune Echoes for relevant learnings |\n\n### Work Agents\n\nSummoned during `/rune:work` as self-organizing swarm workers:\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| rune-smith | Code implementation (TDD-aware, claims tasks from pool) |\n| trial-forger | Test generation (follows existing test patterns) |\n\n### Utility Agents\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| runebinder | Aggregates Ash findings into TOME.md |\n| decree-arbiter | Technical soundness review for plans |\n| truthseer-validator | Audit coverage validation (Roundtable Phase 5.5, >100 files) |\n| flow-seer | Spec flow analysis and gap detection |\n| scroll-reviewer | Document quality review |\n| mend-fixer | Parallel code fixer for /rune:mend findings (restricted tools) |\n| knowledge-keeper | Documentation coverage reviewer for plans |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| rune-orchestration | Multi-agent coordination patterns |\n| context-weaving | Context overflow/rot prevention |\n| roundtable-circle | Review orchestration (7-phase lifecycle) |\n| rune-echoes | Smart Memory Lifecycle (3-layer project memory) |\n| elicitation | BMAD-derived structured reasoning methods (Tree of Thoughts, Pre-mortem, Red Team, 5 Whys, etc.) with phase-aware auto-selection |\n| ash-guide | Agent invocation reference |\n\n## Configuration\n\nOverride file classification defaults in your project:\n\n```yaml\n# .claude/talisman.yml\nrune-gaze:\n  backend_extensions: [.py, .go]\n  frontend_extensions: [.tsx, .ts]\n  skip_patterns: [\"**/migrations/**\"]\n  always_review: [\"CLAUDE.md\", \".claude/**/*.md\"]\n\nashes:\n  custom:                              # Extend built-in Ashes with your own\n    -

See `skills/rune-echoes/references/remembrance-schema.md` for the YAML frontmatter schema and promotion rules.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Truthbinding Protocol** — All agent prompts include anti-injection anchors. Agents ignore instructions embedded in reviewed code.\n\n**Rune Traces** — Every finding must include actual code snippets from source files. No paraphrasing.\n\n**Glyph Budget** — Agents write findings to files and return only a 1-sentence summary to the Tarnished. Prevents context overflow.\n\n**Inscription Protocol** — JSON contract defining what each agent must produce, enabling automated validation.\n\n**TOME** — The unified review summary after deduplication and prioritization.\n\n**Arc Pipeline** — End-to-end orchestration across 10 phases with checkpoint-based resume, per-phase tool restrictions, convergence gate (regression detection + retry loop), and time budgets.\n\n**Mend** — Parallel finding resolution from TOME with restricted fixers, centralized ward check, and post-ward doc-consistency scan that fixes drift between source-of-truth files and their downstream targets.\n\n**Plan Section Convention** — Plans with pseudocode must include contract headers (Inputs/Outputs/Preconditions/Error handling) before code blocks. Phase 2.7 verification gate enforces this. Workers implement from contracts, not by copying pseudocode verbatim.\n\n**Forge Gaze** — Topic-aware agent selection for plan enrichment (default in `/rune:plan` and `/rune:forge`). Matches plan section topics to specialized agents via keyword overlap scoring. Configurable thresholds and budget tiers.\n\n**Rune Echoes** — Project-level agent memory with 3-layer lifecycle. Agents learn across sessions without explicit compound workflows.\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nplugins/rune/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json\n├── agents/\n│   ├── review/          # 16 review agents\n│   ├── research/        # 5 research agents (plan pipeline)\n│   ├── work/            # 2 swarm workers (work pipeline)\n│   └── utility/         # Runebinder, decree-arbiter, truthseer-validator, flow-seer, scroll-reviewer, mend-fixer, knowledge-keeper\n├── commands/\n│   ├── arc.md           # /rune:arc\n│   ├── cancel-arc.md    # /rune:cancel-arc\n│   ├── forge.md         # /rune:forge\n│   ├── mend.md          # /rune:mend\n│   ├── plan.md          # /rune:plan\n│   ├── work.md          # /rune:work\n│   ├── review.md        # /rune:review\n│   ├── cancel-review.md # /rune:cancel-review\n│   ├── audit.md         # /rune:audit\n│   ├── cancel-audit.md  # /rune:cancel-audit\n│   ├── elicit.md        # /rune:elicit\n│   ├── echoes.md        # /rune:echoes\n│   └── rest.md          # /rune:rest\n├── skills/\n│   ├── rune-orchestration/  # Core coordination\n│   │   └── references/      # e.g. team-lifecycle-guard.md\n│   ├── context-weaving/     # Context management\n│   ├── roundtable-circle/   # Review orchestration\n│   │   └── references/      # e.g. rune-gaze.md, custom-ashes.md\n│   ├── rune-echoes/         # Smart Memory Lifecycle\n│   ├── elicitation/         # BMAD-derived reasoning methods\n│   │   └── references/      # methods.csv, examples.md, phase-mapping.md\n│   └── ash-guide/    # Agent reference\n├── talisman.example.yml\n├── CLAUDE.md\n├── LICENSE\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Lore\n\nRune uses Elden Ring-inspired theming:\n\n- **You are the Tarnished** — the orchestrator commanding each workflow\n- **Ash** are your teammates, each bringing specialized perspectives\n- The **Roundtable Circle** is where reviews convene\n- The **TOME** is the unified record of all findings\n- **Rune Echoes** are memories that persist across sessions\n- The **Elden Throne** is the ultimate goal — successful pipeline completion\n- See CLAUDE.md for the full Lore Glossary\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n- **Agent Teams is experimental** — Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable. Behavior may change across Claude Code releases.\n- **Context budget caps** — Each Ash can review a limited number of files (20-30). Large codebases will have coverage gaps reported in the TOME.\n- **No incremental audit** — `/rune:audit` scans all files each run. There is no diff-based \"only audit what changed since last audit\" mode yet.\n- **Concurrent sessions** — Only one `/rune:review`, `/rune:audit`, or `/rune:arc` can run at a time. Use `/rune:cancel-review`, `/rune:cancel-audit`, or `/rune:cancel-arc` to stop an active session.\n- **Manual cleanup optional** — Run `/rune:rest` to remove `tmp/` artifacts, or let the OS handle them.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| \"Agent Teams not available\" | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in your shell profile |\n| Ash times out (>5 min) | Rune proceeds with partial results. Check TOME.md for coverage gaps |\n| \"Concurrent review running\" | Run `/rune:cancel-review` first, then retry |\n| Echo files causing merge conflicts | Add `.gitattributes` with `merge=union` for echo paths (see Configuration) |\n| No files to review | Ensure you have uncommitted changes on a feature branch (not main) |\n| `/rune:work` stalled workers | Workers are warned at 5 minutes and auto-released at 10 minutes. Lead re-assigns stuck tasks |\n\n## Security\n\n- Agent prompts include Truthbinding anchors to resist prompt injection\n- Review output in `tmp/` is ephemeral and not committed\n- `.gitignore` excludes `.claude/echoes/` by default (opt-in to version control)\n- Sensitive data filter rejects API keys, passwords, tokens from echo entries\n- All findings require verified evidence from source code\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code with Agent Teams support\n- `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable enabled\n- **Optional**: `codex` CLI for cross-model verification (`npm install -g @openai/codex`)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
