He's not an engineer. He's a product guy who lives in Linear, thinks in user stories, and has strong opinions about button colors.\n\nOne day Juan decided he was tired of writing PRDs and waiting. He wanted to *contribute to the codebase*. The engineers were... concerned.\n\n> \"What if he pushes to main?\"\n> \"What if he duplicates work someone's already doing?\"\n> \"What if he skips the spike and just starts coding?\"\n> \"What if Greptile roasts him and he doesn't fix it?\"\n\nSo Juan did what any self-respecting Head of Product would do: **he built guardrails for himself.**\n\nThe result is **juan-workflow** — a Claude Code plugin that enforces the full development lifecycle every single time Juan sits down to code. Spike first. Check for duplicates. Get Greptile approval. Assign a human reviewer. No shortcuts.\n\n**The engineers love it.** Juan ships code now. Nothing breaks. And the workflow is so good the whole team uses it.\n\nOpen-sourced because if Juan can do it, anyone can. 🤷\n\n---\n\n## What It Does\n\nOne command — `/juan-workflow:juan-is-working` — orchestrates your entire dev session:\n\n```\nPhase 0  🔍  Setup         Learn your team's patterns (first run only)\nPhase 1  🎯  Discovery     What are we building? Assess scope.\nPhase 2  🔎  Duplicates    Check Linear + GitHub for existing work\nPhase 3  📌  Spike         Create spike in Linear, brainstorm, document\nPhase 4  🏗️  Build         Create task, branch, implement, lint, test\nPhase 5  🚀  PR + Review   Push PR, wait for Greptile, address feedback\nPhase 6  👋  Handoff       Assign reviewer (round-robin), update Linear\n```\n\nEvery phase confirms before advancing. Everything is cross-linked (Linear ↔ GitHub). Nothing falls through the cracks.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code:\n/plugin marketplace add DojoCodingLabs/juan-workflow\n/plugin install juan-workflow@juan-workflow\n```\n\nThat's it. Type `/juan-workflow:juan-is-working` and you're off.\n\n### Updating\n\n```bash\n# Update the marketplace catalog first:\n/plugin marketplace update DojoCodingLabs/juan-workflow\n\n# Then update the plugin:\n/plugin update juan-workflow@juan-workflow\n```\n\nRestart your Claude Code session after updating.\n\n> **Requires:**\n> - [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) with plugin support\n> - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) — authenticated\n> - [Linear MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linear/mcp-server) — connected to Claude Code\n> - [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux)\n> - [Greptile](https://greptile.com) GitHub App — recommended but optional\n\n### Local Development\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/DojoCodingLabs/juan-workflow.git\ncd juan-workflow\n\n# In Claude Code:\n/plugin marketplace add .\n/plugin install juan-workflow\n```\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Every time you sit down to work:\n\n```\n/juan-workflow:juan-is-working\n```\n\nOr with a task description:\n\n```\n/juan-workflow:juan-is-working add a search bar to the movie list page\n```\n\n### The workflow walks you through:\n\n1. **\"What do you want to work on?\"** — Explain your task\n2. **Duplicate check** — Makes sure nobody's already doing this\n3. **Spike** — Brainstorm back and forth, document decisions in Linear\n4. **Implementation** — Create branch, code, lint, test\n5. **PR** — Push and wait for Greptile review\n6. **Handoff** — Assign a human reviewer, update Linear\n\n### Works with /feature-dev\n\nFor large tasks, the workflow will suggest using `/feature-dev` for the implementation phase. It handles everything before (spike, planning) and after (PR, review, handoff) — `/feature-dev` handles the actual coding.\n\n---\n\n## What's Inside\n\n```\njuan-workflow/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata\n│   └── marketplace.json     # Marketplace catalog\n├── commands/\n│   └── juan-is-working.md   # 🧠 The main orchestrator (all 7 phases)\n├── agents/\n│   ├── pattern-learner.md   # 🔍 Discovers org patterns (Phase 0)\n│   └── duplicate-checker.md # 🔎 Finds overlapping work (Phase 2)\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── wait-greptile.sh     # ⏳ Polls for Greptile review (Phase 5)\n│   └── assign-reviewer.sh   # 🎯 Round-robin reviewer pick (Phase 6)\n├── LICENSE\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Pattern Learning (Phase 0)\n\nOn first run, the **pattern-learner** agent analyzes your repo and Linear workspace:\n\n- **Branch naming conventions** — analyzes 20+ recent branches to detect the pattern\n- **PR title format** — learns from 10 recent PRs\n- **Team members** — builds the reviewer pool from GitHub collaborators\n- **Linear workflow states** — maps all states and their IDs\n- **Labels** — finds the Spike label (and others)\n- **Greptile bot** — detects if Greptile is configured and its username\n\nEverything is saved to `.claude/juan-workflow-learned.local.json` (gitignored). Re-learned automatically if the config is older than 7 days.\n\n### Greptile Gating (Phase 5)\n\nAfter creating a PR, the workflow waits for Greptile:\n\n- **6 minute** initial wait\n- **2 minute** retry intervals\n- **15 minute** max wait\n- If Greptile has feedback → address it, push, re-wait\n- If 3 rounds without clean review → offer escape to human review\n- If Greptile isn't configured → skip gracefully\n\n### Round-Robin Reviews (Phase 6)\n\nReviewers are assigned from the learned team pool in round-robin order. The index persists in the config file so it rotates fairly across sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n| Situation | What happens |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Linear MCP unavailable | Warns, continues GitHub-only |\n| `gh` not authenticated | Shows error, asks to run `gh auth login` |\n| Greptile timeout (>15 min) | Asks: wait more / proceed / check manually |\n| Config missing mid-workflow | Re-triggers Phase 0 |\n| Branch name collision | Appends numeric suffix |\n| Greptile loop >3 rounds | Warns, offers escape to human review |\n| Juan says \"stop\" | Graceful exit, shows what was created |\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n| Tool | Required | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|\n| Claude Code | ✅ | With plugin support |\n| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | ✅ | Must be authenticated (`gh auth login`) |\n| Linear MCP | ✅ | Connected to Claude Code |\n| `jq` | ✅ | For scripts (`brew install jq`) |\n| Greptile | 📋 Recommended | If not present, review gating is skipped |\n| `/feature-dev` | 📋 Optional | For large feature implementation |\n\n---\n\n## Future (v2+)\n\n- 🔔 Slack notifications on PR ready\n- 📊 Cycle time analytics\n- 🔄 Auto-resume interrupted workflows\n- 👥 Team mode (not just Juan)\n- 🤖 Greptile MCP integration (when available)\n- 📦 Multi-task batching\n- 📍 Review follow-up monitoring\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis started as a joke plugin for one non-engineer. Now the whole team uses it. If you want to make it better:\n\n- **🐛 Bug fixes** — Found an issue? Open a PR\n- **🔧 New phases** — Got an idea for a workflow step?
