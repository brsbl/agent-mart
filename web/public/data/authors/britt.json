It never uses it. But its a good idea._ 🤷‍♂)\n\n**Use when:** An agent encounters a blocking decision while running in the background\n\n**Features:**\n- Decision framework for assessing when user input is needed (high-risk vs low-risk)\n- External notification support (terminal-notifier, OSA Script, Slack CLI)\n- Proper terminal detection and activation\n\n### writing-product-specs\n\nWrite comprehensive product specification documents that clearly communicate what we're building, why, and how we'll know it's successful.\n\n**Use when:** Designing a new feature or asked to write a product spec/PRD\n\n### writing-user-stories\n\nWrite properly formatted user stories that identify the persona, desired action, and expected benefit.\n\n**Use when:** Asked to write user stories or planning a feature\n\n### writing-verification-plans\n\nCreate verification plans for real-world acceptance testing. Verification uses actual systems, never mocks.\n\n**Use when:** Setting up a new project or when a project needs acceptance testing procedures\n\n**Features:**\n- Defines scenarios with concrete success criteria\n- Instructions for Claude to execute and validate\n- Runs automatically after completing tasks\n- Detailed verification logs\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nAdd this repository as a plugin marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add britt/claude-code-skills\n```\n\n**Install all skills:**\n\n```bash\n/plugin install britt/claude-code-skills\n```\n\n**Install individual skills:**\n\n```bash\n/plugin install britt/daily-planning-ritual\n/plugin install britt/setting-up-a-project\n/plugin install britt/summoning-the-user\n/plugin install britt/writing-product-specs\n/plugin install britt/writing-user-stories\n/plugin install britt/writing-verification-plans\n/plugin install britt/working-on-an-issue\n```\n\n### Claude Code: Manual Installation\n\nSkills can be installed globally or per-project.\n\n**Global installation** (available in all projects):\n\n```bash\n# Clone the entire repository\ngit clone https://github.com/britt/claude-code-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/claude-code-skills\n```\n\n**Project-specific installation**:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the entire repository into the project\ngit clone https://github.com/britt/claude-code-skills.git .claude/skills/claude-code-skills\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code after installation to load new skills.\n\n### Claude.ai (Web and iOS)\n\nSkills can be added to Claude.ai projects as project knowledge:\n\n1. **Download the skill zip file**\n   - Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/britt/claude-code-skills/releases/)\n   - Download the zip file for the skill you want (e.g., `writing-product-specs.zip`)\n\n2. **Add to your Claude.ai project**\n   - Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and go to your project\n   - Click on **Project knowledge** in the sidebar\n   - Upload the zip file\n\n3. **Use the skill**\n   - The skill will be available in all conversations within that project\n   - Claude will automatically use it when the context matches the skill's description\n\n**Note:** Some skills (like `summoning-the-user`) require Claude Code-specific features and won't work in Claude.ai.\n\n## Rules\n\nThe `rules/` directory contains reusable rule sets that can be copied into your project's CLAUDE.md.\n\n### TDD.rules.md\n\nStrict Test-Driven Development rules for Claude. Used by the `setting-up-a-project` skill.\n\n**Key rules:**\n- No production code without a failing test first (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)\n- 90%+ test coverage required on all metrics\n- Violations mean delete and start over\n- Commit early, commit often (after every TDD cycle)\n- Tasks aren't complete until tests pass, build succeeds, and no linter errors\n\n**Usage:** The `setting-up-a-project` skill copies this file verbatim into your project's CLAUDE.md. You can also copy it manually:\n\n```bash\ncurl -o CLAUDE.md \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britt/claude-code-skills/main/rules/TDD.rules.md\n```\n\nFill in the placeholder commands (`<test command>`, `<build command>`, etc.) for your tech stack.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Repository structure, creating skills, and contribution guidelines\n- [Claude Code Skills Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) - Official documentation\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n",
        "skills/daily-planning-ritual/README.md": "# Customizing the Daily Planning Ritual\n\nThe Daily Planning Ritual skill reads from a **static sections artifact** (`references/static-sections-template.md`) to include persistent content in every daily plan. Edit this file to customize what appears in your plans.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe skill automatically copies these sections from the artifact into each daily plan:\n\n- **Climbing Goals** - Your ongoing climbing objectives\n- **Life Projects** - Personal projects and initiatives  \n- **Work Priorities** - Current work focus areas\n- **Work Questions** - Reflective questions about work\n- **Life Questions** - Broader life reflection questions\n\nThese sections are copied exactly as-is, so you can customize the skill's output by editing the artifact file.\n\n## Creating the Static Sections Artifact\n\nCreate `references/static-sections-template.md` with this structure:\n\n```markdown\nClimbing Goals\n[Your climbing goals here]\n\nLife Projects\n[Your life projects here]\n\nWork Priorities\n[Your work priorities here]\n\nWork Questions\n[Your work reflection questions here]\n\nLife Questions\n[Your life reflection questions here]\n```\n\n## Customization Examples\n\n### Change Section Names\n\nYou can rename sections in the artifact to match your priorities:\n\n```markdown\nFitness Goals\n[Instead of Climbing Goals]\n\nCreative Projects\n[Instead of Life Projects]\n\nCareer Priorities\n[Instead of Work Priorities]\n```\n\n**Important:** If you change section names, you **must** also update `skills/daily-planning-ritual/SKILL.md`:\n\n1. Update **Step 1** - Change references to the section names when reading the artifact\n2. Update **Step 3** - Modify the plan format to use your new section names\n3. Update **Step 2** - If you renamed \"Life Questions\", update the reference in the closing questions section\n\nThe skill looks for exact section headers, so both the artifact and SKILL.md must match. Alternatively, keep the original section names and customize only the content.\n\n### Customize Reflection Questions\n\nThe skill selects one question from your **Life Questions** section during the planning conversation. Customize this section to control what questions get asked:\n\n```markdown\nLife Questions\n- What am I avoiding that needs attention?\n- Where am I creating unnecessary friction?\n- What would make today feel complete?\n- How can I be more present with others?\n```\n\nAdd, remove, or reorder questions to match your reflection style.\n\n### Update Priorities Over Time\n\nEdit the artifact whenever your priorities change:\n\n- **Weekly:** Update Work Priorities as projects shift\n- **Monthly:** Refresh Life Projects as initiatives evolve\n- **Seasonally:** Adjust Climbing Goals or fitness objectives\n\nChanges take effect immediately—the next planning session will use the updated content.\n\n### Add New Sections\n\nTo include additional persistent sections in your plans:\n\n1. Add the section to `references/static-sections-template.md`\n2. Update `skills/daily-planning-ritual/SKILL.md`:\n   - **Step 1** - Add the new section name to the list of sections read from the artifact\n   - **Step 3** - Add the new section to the plan format template\n\nExample: Add a \"Learning Goals\" section:\n\n```markdown\nLearning Goals\n[Your learning objectives]\n```\n\nThen update SKILL.md to reference \"Learning Goals\" in both Step 1 and Step 3.\n\n## Relationship to the Skill\n\nThe skill is **read-only** regarding static sections—it copies content but never modifies the artifact. However, if you change section names or add new sections, you must update the skill itself:\n\n- **Content changes** - Edit the artifact file directly (no skill changes needed)\n- **Section name changes** - Update both the artifact AND `SKILL.md` Step 1 and Step 3\n- **New sections** - Add to the artifact AND update `SKILL.md` Step 1 and Step 3\n\nThe artifact acts as a configuration file, but the skill must know which sections to look for. Keep them in sync when customizing section structure.\n"
