Summary** — one-page overview with cost breakdown, complexity score, and architecture pattern\n2. **Architecture Diagram** — C4 Container diagram in Mermaid, plus agent flow diagram if applicable\n3. **Application Architecture & Patterns** — architecture pattern (clean, hexagonal, modular monolith, etc.), folder structure, design principles (DI, SRP), error handling, and testing strategy\n4. **Shared Types & Cross-Service Contracts** — shared domain types, reusable libraries, service contracts (OpenAPI, event schemas, Protobuf), and inter-service communication detail table\n5. **API Artifacts** — OpenAPI/Swagger specs (YAML), Postman collections (JSON), AsyncAPI specs for event-driven services, and GraphQL schemas — ready to import into Swagger UI, Postman, and AsyncAPI Studio\n6. **Security Architecture** — auth strategy, API security checklist (rate limiting, input validation, CORS, headers), data protection (encryption, PII handling, secrets management), and OWASP threat mitigations\n7. **Observability & Monitoring** — structured logging, health checks per service, key metrics with alert thresholds, monitoring stack recommendation, and distributed tracing guidance\n8. **DevOps Blueprint** — CI/CD pipeline (stages, triggers, provider), branch strategy, environment definitions (local/staging/production), database migration tooling, config management, and feature flags\n9. **Cost Estimate** — infrastructure + third-party + LLM token costs in low/medium/high scenarios\n10. **Complexity Assessment** — 10-factor scoring with risk flags and simpler alternatives\n11. **Well-Architected Review** — 6-pillar evaluation (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance, cost optimization, developer experience) with per-pillar scores, gap analysis, and prioritized improvement roadmap\n12. **Plain English Specifications** — features grouped by component, written for non-technical stakeholders\n13. **Required Accounts** — every third-party service with signup URL, setup steps, and free tier details\n14. **Next Steps Guide** — 3 paths forward: build with AI tools, hire a developer, or hire an agency\n15. **Sprint Backlog** — time-boxed sprint plan with goals, user stories, and dependencies derived from complexity score and architecture\n\n### From `/architect:quick-spec`\n\nA one-page architecture overview in under 5 minutes — system overview, component list, cost range, complexity score, and one recommended next step. Perfect for idea validation.\n\n### From `/architect:agent-spec`\n\nComplete AI agent architecture including LLM provider recommendation, orchestration pattern, tool definitions, memory strategy, guardrails, token cost modeling, agent flow diagram, example conversation, and a system prompt skeleton.\n\n### From `/architect:cost-estimate`\n\nDetailed cost breakdown across infrastructure, third-party services, and AI/LLM usage. Three scenarios (free tiers, starter, production), monthly and yearly totals, development cost ranges, and cost optimization tips.\n\n### From `/architect:complexity-check`\n\n10-factor complexity assessment with per-factor scoring, risk flags for high-scoring areas, simpler alternatives if the product scores above 6, and build-path recommendations based on the overall score.\n\n### From `/architect:compare-stack`\n\nSide-by-side technology comparison with scoring matrix, summary scores, a clear recommendation, and guidance on when to choose each option.\n\n### From `/architect:hiring-brief`\n\nDeveloper hiring package with role descriptions, required skills, interview questions, milestone-based payment schedules, an Upwork posting template, and an agency brief template.\n\n### From `/architect:well-architected`\n\nSix-pillar architecture quality review. Evaluates operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and developer experience. Each pillar scored 1-5 with strengths, gaps, and specific recommendations. Includes a prioritized improvement roadmap and stage-appropriate assessment (MVP vs production expectations).\n\n### From `/architect:scaffold`\n\nTurns your architecture blueprint into real projects. After running `/architect:blueprint`, this command creates directories (or GitHub repos) for each component — frontend, backend services, mobile apps, AI agents — and bootstraps them with framework-appropriate starter code, `.env.example` files, READMEs, and git initialization. Supports Next.js, Express, FastAPI, React Native (Expo), BullMQ workers, and Python/Node.js AI agents.\n\n### From `/architect:sync-backlog`\n\nPushes the sprint backlog (deliverable 4o) from a blueprint directly into Azure DevOps or Jira. Creates epics per architecture component, sprints with goals and dates, and user stories assigned to each sprint. All items tagged `architect` for easy filtering. Supports Azure CLI (`az boards`) and Jira REST API / `jira-cli`.\n\n### From `/architect:publish-api-docs`\n\nTakes the API artifacts (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman collections) from a blueprint and generates interactive API documentation. Creates Swagger UI and Redoc HTML pages, raw spec files, and an index page — ready to serve locally or deploy to GitHub Pages.\n\n### From `/architect:setup-env`\n\nGuided environment setup that walks through each third-party account from the Required Accounts list, validates API keys with live API calls, and writes a verified `.env` file. Handles multi-component projects, masks secrets in output, and verifies `.gitignore` before writing credentials.\n\n### From `/architect:export-diagrams`\n\nRenders all Mermaid architecture diagrams from a blueprint to PNG and SVG image files. Produces both light and dark theme variants using the Mermaid CLI, with fallback to mermaid.ink and Kroki APIs.\n\n### From `/architect:security-scan`\n\nRead-only security validation that checks scaffolded code against the blueprint's security checklist. Scans for auth middleware, CORS, helmet headers, rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention, and hardcoded secrets. Reports pass/stub/missing/risk status for each check.\n\n### From `/architect:setup-cicd`\n\nConfigures real CI/CD pipelines from the blueprint's DevOps section. Creates GitHub Actions workflows (or Azure Pipelines / GitLab CI), adds deployment steps for Vercel, Railway, AWS, or Azure, and lists all required repository secrets.\n\n### From `/architect:generate-data-model`\n\nTurns shared type stubs from the blueprint into real ORM schemas. Generates Prisma schemas, SQLAlchemy models, Mongoose schemas, or Drizzle tables — with relationships, indexes, enums, and seed data. Optionally runs the initial migration.\n\n### From `/architect:sdl`\n\nWork directly with Solution Design Language (SDL) — the structured YAML specification that captures architecture decisions. Four modes:\n\n- **Generate** — Convert a conversation or project description into a validated SDL document\n- **Validate** — Parse, validate against the v0.1 schema, check conditional rules, and report errors with fix suggestions\n- **Diff** — Structurally compare two SDL versions with named array matching and change summaries\n- **Template** — Browse 10 starter templates (SaaS, e-commerce, mobile, internal tool, API platform, AI product, marketplace, admin dashboard, subscription SaaS, real-time collaboration) and customize them\n\n## Skills\n\nThe plugin includes 22 domain knowledge
