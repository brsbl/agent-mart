        "README.md": "# Lean Skills\n\nOfficial [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for developing with [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4).\n\nThese skills help AI coding agents work effectively with Lean 4 code — writing proofs, setting up development environments, debugging toolchain regressions, and following project conventions.\n\n## Skills included\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `lean-proof` | Writing Lean proofs: one step at a time, error priority, hardest case first |\n| `lean-setup` | Setting up a lean4 development environment with elan toolchains |\n| `lean-bisect` | Bisecting Lean toolchain versions to find regressions |\n| `lean-mwe` | Creating minimal working examples for bug reports |\n| `lean-pr` | PR conventions for the lean4 repository |\n| `mathlib-build` | Building Mathlib with appropriate verbosity settings |\n| `mathlib-pr` | PR conventions for Mathlib: labels, merge process, queueboard |\n| `mathlib-review` | Review guidelines for Mathlib PRs: tools, attributes, style checks |\n| `nightly-testing` | Understanding the Lean/Mathlib nightly testing infrastructure |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nIn Claude Code, type `/plugin`, under \"Marketplaces\" add \"https://github.com/leanprover/skills.git\", then under \"Plugins\" install the `lean` plugin.\n\nOr in a terminal\n```\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/leanprover/skills.git\nclaude plugin install lean@leanprover\n```\n\n### Gemini CLI\n\n```bash\ngemini skills install https://github.com/leanprover/skills --path skills\n```\n\n### Codex CLI\n\nInside a Codex session:\n```\n$skill-installer install https://github.com/leanprover/skills/tree/main/skills/*\n```\n\nOr clone and copy the skills:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/leanprover/skills.git /tmp/lean-skills\ncp -r /tmp/lean-skills/skills/* ~/.codex/skills/\n```\n\n### Other tools\n\nClone this repository and point your tool at the `skills/` directory.\n\n## Testing\n\nEvery skill should be validated by test cases that demonstrate it actually improves agent performance. As base model capabilities increase over time, skills that no longer provide value can be identified and removed.\n\nEach test case is a YAML file in `skills/<name>/tests/` specifying a git repo, commit SHA, and prompt. Test infrastructure and results live in a separate repository: [leanprover/skills-testing](https://github.com/leanprover/skills-testing).\n\n### Checking validation status\n\n```bash\n# Check that all skills have current satisfactory results\nscripts/check-validation\n\n# Check a specific skill\nscripts/check-validation lean-proof\n```\n\nThis is also run in CI on every push and pull request.\n\n### Running tests\n\nClone the testing repo into this directory (it's gitignored):\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/leanprover/skills-testing.git\n```\n\nThen run tests:\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests for a skill\nskills-testing/scripts/run-skill-tests lean-proof\n\n# Judge completed runs\nskills-testing/scripts/judge-all\n\n# View results\nskills-testing/scripts/summary --latest\n```\n\nCommit results back to skills-testing so CI passes.\n\n### Test case format\n\n```yaml\nrepo: \"https://github.com/owner/repo.git\"\nsha: \"abc123\"\nprompt: |\n  Your prompt here.\ndescription: \"What this tests\"\n# Optional: subdirectory, claude_flags, timeout (default 600s)\n```\n\n### Judge verdicts\n\n- **satisfactory** — the skill meaningfully improved the response\n- **not_needed** — the base model performed equally well without the skill\n- **needs_improvement** — the skill helped but could be better (suggestions provided)\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n"
