Every session compounds on the last.

Or use any skill standalone: `/council validate this PR` works with zero setup.\n- **Catches bugs before they reach your branch.** Multi-model councils validate plans before coding (`/pre-mortem`) and code before shipping (`/vibe`). Failures retry with context — after 3 retries, the system surfaces the failure with full context for your decision.\n- **Gets better the more you use it.** Post-mortem extracts what worked, what didn't, and how to improve the tools themselves. Then it suggests the next `/rpi` command. The system improves its own process.\n- **Remembers everything across sessions.** Research loads prior knowledge. Each worker gets fresh context. Learnings persist in `.agents/` and git — no context resets between sessions. `ao search` finds knowledge across files and past chat history, with maturity-weighted ranking powered by [CASS](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search).\n- **Enforces its own workflow.** 12 hooks across 8 lifecycle events block bad pushes, enforce lead-only commits, gate `/crank` on `/pre-mortem`, and auto-inject language-specific standards. The system doesn't just suggest good practice — it requires it.\n\nWorks with **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Cursor**, **Open Code** — any agent that supports [Skills](https://skills.sh). All state is local.\n\n---\n\n## Who This Is For\n\n**Solo developers** who ship fast but skip validation — or burn hours doing it manually. AgentOps runs `/rpi` end-to-end so you get multi-model code review, retry-on-failure, and knowledge that persists across sessions. No team required.\n\n**Tech leads scaling agent work** across a backlog. `/crank` runs parallel waves with fresh context per worker. `/status` shows what's in flight. `/post-mortem` captures what the system learned so the next cycle doesn't repeat mistakes. You manage the roadmap, not the agents.\n\n**Quality-focused maintainers** who need high-confidence releases without manual regression hunting. `/pre-mortem` catches plan gaps before coding starts. `/vibe` validates code before push. The knowledge flywheel preserves institutional knowledge even when team members change.\n\n---\n\n## Install\n\n**Requires:** Node.js 18+ and a coding agent that supports [Skills](https://skills.sh) (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Open Code).\n\n```bash\nnpx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops --all -g\n```\n\nThen open your coding agent and type `/quickstart`. That's it.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Full setup (CLI + hooks)</summary>\n\n```bash\nbrew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops && brew install agentops\nao hooks install        # Flywheel hooks (SessionStart + Stop)\nao hooks install --full # All 12 hooks across 8 lifecycle events\n```\n\nThe `ao` CLI adds automatic knowledge injection/extraction, ratchet gates, and session lifecycle. All 34 skills work without it.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other install methods</summary>\n\n**Claude Code plugin path:**\n```bash\nclaude plugin add boshu2/agentops\n```\n\n**Install script** (plugin + optional CLI + hooks):\n```bash\nbash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/main/scripts/install.sh)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>\n\nIf slash commands don't appear: `npx skills@latest update`\n\nMore: [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## The Path\n\n```\n/quickstart                          ← first session: guided tour on your codebase\n    │\n/council, /research, /vibe           ← use skills standalone, learn the pieces\n    │\n/rpi \"goal\"                          ← full lifecycle: research → ship → learn\n    │\n/evolve                              ← define goals, let the system improve itself\n```\n\nStart with `/quickstart`. Use individual skills when you need them. Graduate to `/rpi` for end-to-end. Set `GOALS.yaml` and let `/evolve` compound from there.\n\n---\n\n## The Workflow\n\n1. **`/research`** — Explores your codebase. Produces a research artifact with findings and recommendations.\n\n2. **`/plan`** — Decomposes the goal into issues with dependency waves. Derives three-tier boundaries (Always / Ask First / Never) to prevent scope creep, and conformance checks — verifiable assertions generated from the spec itself. Creates a [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) epic (git-native issue tracking).\n\n3. **`/pre-mortem`** — 4 judges simulate failures before you write code, including a spec-completeness judge that validates plan boundaries and conformance checks. FAIL? Re-plan with feedback and try again (max 3).\n\n4. **`/crank`** — Spawns parallel agents in waves. Each worker gets fresh context. Cross-cutting constraints from the plan are injected into every wave's validation pass. `--test-first` uses a spec-first TDD model — specs and tests before implementation in every wave. Lead validates and commits. Runs until every issue is closed.\n\n5. **`/vibe`** — 3 judges validate the code. FAIL? Re-crank with failure context and re-vibe (max 3).\n\n6. **`/post-mortem`** — Council validates the implementation. Retro extracts learnings. Synthesizes process improvements. **Suggests the next `/rpi` command.**\n\n`/rpi \"goal\"` runs all six, end to end (micro-epics of 2 or fewer issues auto-detect fast-path: inline validation instead of full council, ~15 min faster with no quality loss). Use `--interactive` if you want human gates at research and plan.\n\n### Phased RPI: Own Your Context Window\n\n`/rpi` runs all six phases in one Claude session. That works — but the context window fills up. Compaction kicks in, and while it's mostly fine (the real state lives in the plan and beads issues, not the conversation), you're still hoping compaction doesn't lose something important.\n\n`ao rpi phased` solves this. Each phase runs in its own fresh Claude session. The Go CLI carries state between phases through filesystem artifacts — goal, verdicts, phase summaries — so each session starts clean with exactly the context it needs.\n\n```\n> ao rpi phased \"add rate limiting to the API\"\n\n[phase 1/6] research  — spawning Claude session...done\n[phase 2/6] plan      — spawning Claude session...done  (3 issues, 2 waves)\n[phase 3/6] pre-mortem — spawning Claude session...done  (PASS)\n[phase 4/6] crank     — spawning Claude session...done  (2 waves complete)\n[phase 5/6] vibe      — spawning Claude session...done  (PASS)\n[phase 6/6] post-mortem — spawning Claude session...done (3 learnings)\n```\n\nThree ways to use it:\n\n- **Hands-free** — `ao rpi phased \"goal\"` runs start to finish, no prompts. Walk away.\n- **Interactive** — `ao rpi phased --interactive \"goal\"` pauses at research and plan for your review. Step through it, approve each phase, keep full control.\n- **Resume** — `ao rpi phased --from=crank \"goal\"` picks up from any phase. Session crashed during crank? Resume there. Want to re-run just validation? `--from=vibe`.\n\n**Run multiple in parallel** — each run gets its own git worktree, so parallel invocations don't collide on state files or code changes:\n\n```bash\nao rpi phased \"add auth\" &\nao rpi phased \"fix perf\" &\n# Each runs in ../<repo>-rpi-<runID>/, merges back on success\n```\n\nON by default. `--no-worktree` to opt out. On failure or Ctrl+C, the worktree is preserved for debugging.\n\nThe `/rpi` skill and `ao rpi phased` command do the same work. The difference is context control: one session vs. six fresh sessions. Use `/rpi` for small goals where context fits comfortably. Use `ao rpi phased` when the goal is big enough that you want each phase thinking clearly.\n\n---\n\n## The Flywheel\n\nThis is what makes AgentOps different. The system doesn't just run — it compounds.\n\n```\n  /rpi \"goal A\"\n    │\n    ├── research → plan → pre-mortem → crank → vibe\n    │\n    ▼\n  /post-mortem\n    ├── council validates what shipped\n    ├── retro extracts what you learned\n    ├── proposes how to improve the skills   ← the tools get better\n    └── \"Next: /rpi <enhancement>\" ────┐\n                                       │\n  /rpi \"goal B\" ◄──────────────────────┘\n    │\n    └── ...repeat forever\n```\n\nPost-mortem doesn't just wrap up. It analyzes every learning from the retro, asks \"what process would this improve?\", and writes concrete improvement proposals. Then it hands you a ready-to-copy `/rpi` command targeting the highest-priority improvement. You come back, paste it, walk away. The system grows its knowledge stock with each cycle.\n\nLearnings don't enter the knowledge base unchecked — they pass quality gates scored on specificity, actionability, novelty, context, and confidence, then land in gold/silver/bronze tiers. Good learnings get promoted over time; weak ones get demoted. Freshness decay (inspired by [MemRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06173) two-phase retrieval) ensures recent insights outweigh stale patterns automatically.\n\n### Goal-Driven Mode: `/evolve`\n\nDefine what \"done\" looks like in `GOALS.yaml` — a quality contract with measurable goals and priority weights:\n\n```yaml\ngoals:\n  - id: test-pass-rate\n    description: \"All tests pass\"\n    check: \"go test ./...\"       # exit 0 = pass\n    weight: 10                   # fix this first\n  - id: doc-coverage\n    description: \"All public skills have reference docs\"\n    check: \"test $(ls -d skills/*/references/ | wc -l) -ge 16\"\n    weight: 7\n```\n\n`/evolve` reads `GOALS.yaml`, measures every goal, picks the worst failing one (highest weight), runs a full `/rpi` cycle to fix it, re-measures, and loops. After each cycle, `/evolve` re-measures ALL goals — not just the target. If any goal regresses, every commit from that cycle is auto-reverted. This full regression gate is what makes \"walk away\" safe. Each cycle loads learnings from all prior cycles via the flywheel. When all goals pass, the system goes dormant — a valid success state, not a bug. You define the goals; the system handles the rest.\n\nKill switch at any time: `echo \"stop\" > ~/.config/evolve/KILL`\n\n**Session 1:** Your agent ships a feature but the tests are weak.\n**Session 2:** The flywheel already knows — `/vibe` now checks test assertion coverage because last cycle's retro proposed it.\n**Session 10:** Your agent catches bugs it would have missed on day one. Not because you configured anything — because the system learned.\n\n---\n\n## The Design: Four Pillars\n\nEvery skill, goal, and hook in AgentOps maps to one of four pillars:\n\n**Knowledge Compounding** — The system remembers. `/inject` loads prior learnings at session start. `/forge` mines transcripts at session end. `/retro` extracts what worked and what didn't. Each session is smarter than the last because the flywheel never stops turning.\n\n**Validated Acceleration** — Speed without recklessness. `/council` spawns parallel judges for multi-model consensus. `/pre-mortem` catches plan gaps before coding. `/vibe` validates code before shipping. Failures retry with context — no human escalation needed.\n\n**Goal-Driven Automation** — Define goals, not tasks. `/evolve` measures fitness against `GOALS.yaml` and runs `/rpi` cycles until all goals pass. `/crank` executes entire epics hands-free with wave-based parallelism. The system works toward outcomes, not checklists.\n\n**Zero-Friction Workflow** — Start in 60 seconds. `/quickstart` runs a guided cycle on your actual codebase. `/implement` picks up a single issue end-to-end. `/handoff` preserves context across sessions. `/status` shows where you are and what to do next. No configuration required.\n\nThese pillars are codified in [`GOALS.yaml`](GOALS.yaml) — 42 measurable goals that define what \"healthy\" means for the system. `/evolve` measures them all.\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\n34 skills total: 24 user-facing across three tiers, plus 10 internal skills that fire automatically.\n\n### Orchestration\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/rpi` | Goal to production — 6-phase lifecycle with self-correcting retry loops |\n| `/council` | Multi-model consensus — parallel judges, consolidated verdict |\n| `/crank` | Hands-free epic execution — runs waves until all issues closed (supports `--test-first` TDD) |\n| `/swarm` | Parallel agents with fresh context — Codex sub-agents or Claude teams |\n| `/codex-team` | Parallel Codex execution agents |\n| `/evolve` | Goal-driven fitness loop — measures goals, fixes worst gap, compounds via flywheel |\n\n### Workflow\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/research` | Deep codebase exploration |\n| `/plan` | Decompose goal into issues with dependency waves, boundaries, and conformance checks |\n| `/implement` | Single issue, full lifecycle |\n| `/vibe` | Complexity analysis + multi-model validation gate |\n| `/pre-mortem` | Simulate failures before coding (4 judges incl. spec-completeness) |\n| `/post-mortem` | Validate implementation + extract learnings + suggest next cycle |\n| `/release` | Pre-flight checks, changelog, version bumps, tag |\n\n### Utilities\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/status` | Dashboard — current work, next action |\n| `/quickstart` | Interactive onboarding |\n| `/retro` | Extract learnings from completed work |\n| `/knowledge` | Query knowledge base |\n| `/bug-hunt` | Root cause analysis with git archaeology |\n| `/complexity` | Code complexity metrics |\n| `/doc` | Documentation generation and validation |\n| `/product` | Generate `PRODUCT.md` — unlocks product-aware judges in `/pre-mortem` and `/vibe` automatically |\n| `/trace` | Trace design decisions through history |\n| `/handoff` | Structured session handoff |\n| `/inbox` | Agent Mail monitoring |\n\n<details>\n<summary>Internal skills (auto-loaded, 10 total)</summary>\n\n| Skill | Trigger | What it does |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `inject` | Session start | Load prior knowledge into context |\n| `extract` | On demand | Pull learnings from artifacts |\n| `forge` | Session end | Mine transcript for decisions and patterns |\n| `flywheel` | On demand | Knowledge health metrics |\n| `ratchet` | On demand | Progress gates — once locked, stays locked |\n| `standards` | By `/vibe`, `/implement` | Language-specific coding rules |\n| `beads` | By `/plan`, `/implement` | Git-native issue tracking |\n| `provenance` | On demand | Trace knowledge artifact lineage |\n| `shared` | By distributed skills | Shared reference documents |\n| `using-agentops` | Auto-injected | Workflow guide |\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\nAgent output quality is determined by context input quality. Every pattern below — fresh context per worker, ratcheted progress, least-privilege loading — exists to ensure the right information is in the right window at the right time.\n\nParallel agents produce noisy output; councils filter it; ratchets lock progress so it can never regress.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>The Brownian Ratchet</strong> — chaos in, locked progress out</summary>\n\n```\n  ╭─ agent-1 ─→ ✓ ─╮\n  ├─ agent-2 ─→ ✗ ─┤   3 attempts, 1 fails\n  ├─ agent-3 ─→ ✓ ─┤   council catches it\n  ╰─ council ──→ PASS   ratchet locks the result\n                  ↓\n          can't go backward\n```\n\nSpawn parallel agents (chaos), validate with multi-model council (filter), merge to main (ratchet). Failed agents are cheap — fresh context means no contamination.\n\n</details>\n\nEvery wave gets a fresh worker set with clean context — no bleed-through between waves.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Ralph Loops</strong> — fresh context every wave</summary>\n\n```\n  Wave 1:  spawn 3 workers → write files → lead validates → lead commits\n  Wave 2:  spawn 2 workers → ...same pattern, zero accumulated context\n```\n\nEvery wave gets a fresh worker set.

All have a kill switch: `AGENTOPS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1`.\n\n| Hook | Trigger | What it does |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| Push gate | `git push` | Blocks push if `/vibe` hasn't passed |\n| Pre-mortem gate | `/crank` invocation | Blocks `/crank` if `/pre-mortem` hasn't passed |\n| Worker guard | `git commit` | Blocks workers from committing (lead-only) |\n| Dangerous git guard | `force-push`, `reset --hard` | Blocks destructive git commands |\n| Standards injector | Write/Edit | Auto-injects language-specific coding rules |\n| Ratchet nudge | Any prompt | \"Run /vibe before pushing\" |\n| Task validation | Task completed | Validates metadata before accepting |\n| Session start | Session start | Knowledge injection, stale state cleanup |\n| Ratchet advance | After Bash | Locks progress gates |\n| Stop team guard | Session stop | Prevents premature stop with active teams |\n| Precompact snapshot | Before compaction | Saves state before context compaction |\n| Pending cleaner | Session start | Cleans stale pending state |\n\nAll hooks use `lib/hook-helpers.sh` for structured error recovery — failures include suggested next actions and auto-handoff context.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Context Windowing</strong> — bounded execution for large codebases</summary>\n\nFor repos over ~1500 files, `/rpi` uses deterministic shards to keep each worker's context window bounded. Run `scripts/rpi/context-window-contract.sh` before `/rpi` to enable sharding. This prevents context overflow and keeps worker quality consistent regardless of codebase size.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## The `ao` CLI\n\nOptional but recommended. The CLI is plumbing — skills and hooks call it automatically. You install it, your agent uses it. You don't type `ao` commands yourself (with three exceptions below).\n\n**How it works:** 12 hooks fire `ao` commands at session lifecycle boundaries (start, stop, tool use, compaction). Skills call `ao` commands internally during `/rpi`, `/post-mortem`, `/status`, `/flywheel`, and other workflows. Every `ao` command is wired to at least one automated caller.\n\n**What it enables:**\n\n- **Search** — `ao search` finds knowledge across files and past chat history, with [CASS](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search)-powered maturity-weighted ranking. For full session search across Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents, use [`cass`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search) directly.\n- **Knowledge curation** — Learnings flow through quality pools (`ao pool`), human review gates (`ao gate`), and maturity transitions (`ao maturity`). [MemRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06173)-inspired reward signals (`ao feedback`) update ranking automatically via hooks.\n- **Forge→temper→store pipeline** — `ao forge` extracts knowledge from transcripts at session end, `ao temper` validates and locks it during `/post-mortem`, `ao store` indexes it for retrieval. Fully automated.\n- **Feedback loop** — `ao feedback-loop` closes the MemRL reward cycle, `ao session-outcome` records composite reward signals, `ao task-feedback` applies outcomes to associated learnings. All fire automatically at session end.\n- **Provenance** — `ao trace` follows any artifact back to the session transcript that created it.\n- **Ratchet gates** — `ao ratchet` tracks RPI workflow progress and prevents regression. Once a phase passes, it stays passed.\n- **Plans** — `ao plans` maintains a registry connecting research artifacts to [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issues, with drift detection.\n- **Metrics** — `ao metrics`, `ao badge`, and `ao task-status` give quantitative flywheel health. `/status` renders them into a dashboard.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Automation map</strong> — which skills/hooks call which commands</summary>\n\n| ao command | Called by |\n|------------|----------|\n| `inject`, `extract`, `ratchet status`, `maturity --scan` | SessionStart hooks |\n| `forge transcript`, `session-outcome`, `feedback-loop`, `task-sync`, `batch-feedback` | SessionEnd hooks |\n| `flywheel close-loop` | Stop hook |\n| `ratchet record` | `/rpi` (each phase), ratchet-advance hook |\n| `forge index`, `feedback-loop`, `session-outcome`, `temper validate`, `task-feedback` | `/post-mortem`, `/retro` |\n| `badge`, `task-status`, `flywheel status`, `ratchet status` | `/status` |\n| `maturity --scan`, `promote-anti-patterns`, `badge`, `forge status` | `/flywheel` |\n| `search`, `pool`, `plans` | `/research`, `/knowledge`, `/plan` |\n\n</details>\n\n**Install:**\n```bash\nbrew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops && brew install agentops\nao hooks install       # Flywheel hooks (SessionStart + Stop)\nao hooks install --full # All 12 hooks across 8 lifecycle events\n```\n\n**The three commands you'll actually type:**\n```bash\nao rpi phased \"goal\"   # Full RPI lifecycle, fresh context per phase (see Phased RPI above)\nao search \"query\"      # Search knowledge (also: --cass, --use-sc, --type)\nao demo                # Interactive demo of capabilities\n```\n\nEverything else runs automatically. `ao quick-start` and `ao export-constraints` are the only other human-initiated commands (setup and debugging).\n\n73 commands total.

Your agent doesn't remember what failed last time, doesn't validate its plan before coding, doesn't check its code with a second opinion, and doesn't capture what it learned. You fill those gaps manually — re-explaining context, reviewing code, tracking what changed. With AgentOps, the system handles context, validation, and memory. You manage the roadmap.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How does this compare to other approaches?</strong></summary>\n\n| Approach | What it does well | What AgentOps adds |\n|----------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Direct agent use** (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) | Full autonomy, simple to start | Multi-model councils, fresh-context waves, and knowledge that compounds across sessions. A bare agent starts fresh each session; ours extracts learnings and applies them next time. |\n| **Custom prompts** (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md) | Flexible, version-controlled | Static instructions don't compound. The flywheel auto-extracts learnings and injects them back. `/post-mortem` proposes changes to the tools themselves. |\n| **Agent orchestrators** (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) | Multi-language task scheduling | Those choreograph sequential tasks; we compose parallel waves with validation at every stage. No external state backend — all learnings are git-tracked. |\n| **CI/CD gates** (GitHub Actions, pre-commit) | Automated, industry standard | Gates run after code is written. Ours run before coding (`/pre-mortem`) and before push (`/vibe`). Failures retry with context, not human escalation. |\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What data leaves my machine?</strong></summary>\n\nAgentOps itself stores nothing externally — all state lives in `.agents/` (git-tracked, local). No telemetry, no cloud, no external services. Your coding agent's normal API traffic to its LLM provider still applies.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Can I use this with other AI coding tools?</strong></summary>\n\nYes — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Open Code, anything supporting [Skills](https://skills.sh). The `--mixed` council mode adds Codex judges alongside Claude. Knowledge artifacts are plain markdown.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What does PRODUCT.md do?</strong></summary>\n\nRun `/product` to generate a `PRODUCT.md` describing your mission, personas, and competitive landscape. Once it exists, `/pre-mortem` automatically adds product perspectives (user-value, adoption-barriers) and `/vibe` adds developer-experience perspectives (api-clarity, error-experience) to their council reviews. Your agent understands what matters to your product — not just whether the code compiles.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What are the current limitations?</strong></summary>\n\n- **Single primary author so far.** The system works but hasn't been stress-tested across diverse codebases and team sizes. Looking for early adopters willing to break things.\n- **Quality pool can over-promote.** Context-specific patterns sometimes get promoted as general knowledge. Freshness decay helps but doesn't fully solve stale injection.\n- **Retry loops cap at 3.** If a council or crank wave fails three times, the system surfaces the failure to you rather than looping forever. This is intentional but means some edge cases need human judgment.\n- **Knowledge curation is imperfect.** Freshness decay prevents the worst staleness, but the scoring heuristics (specificity, actionability, novelty) are tuned for one author's workflow. Your mileage may vary.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How do I uninstall?</strong></summary>\n\n```bash\nnpx skills@latest remove boshu2/agentops -g\nbrew uninstall agentops  # if installed\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Built on</strong></summary>\n\n| Project | Role |\n|---------|------|\n| [Ralph Wiggum pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) | Fresh context per agent — no bleed-through |\n| [Multiclaude](https://github.com/dlorenc/multiclaude) | Validation gates that lock — no regression |\n| [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) | Git-native issue tracking |\n| [CASS](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search) | Unified search across coding agent chat histories |\n| [MemRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06173) | Two-phase retrieval for cross-session memory |\n\n</details>\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
