        "productivity/README.md": "# Productivity Plugin\n\nA productivity plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. Task management, workplace memory, and a visual dashboard — Claude learns your people, projects, and terminology so it can act like a colleague, not a chatbot.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nclaude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/productivity\n```\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin gives Claude a persistent understanding of your work:\n\n- **Task management** — A markdown task list (`TASKS.md`) that Claude reads, writes, and executes against. Add tasks naturally, and Claude tracks status, triages stale items, and syncs with external tools.\n- **Workplace memory** — A two-tier memory system that teaches Claude your shorthand, people, projects, and terminology. Say \"ask todd to do the PSR for oracle\" and Claude knows exactly who, what, and which deal.\n- **Visual dashboard** — A local HTML file that gives you a board view of your tasks and a live view of what Claude knows about your workplace. Edit from the board or the file — they stay in sync.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/start` | Initialize tasks + memory, open the dashboard |\n| `/update` | Triage stale items, check memory for gaps, sync from external tools if applicable |\n| `/update --comprehensive` | Deep scan email, calendar, chat — flag missed todos and suggest new memories |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `memory-management` | Two-tier memory system — CLAUDE.md for working memory, memory/ directory for deep storage |\n| `task-management` | Markdown-based task tracking using a shared TASKS.md file |\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Getting Started\n\n```\nYou: /start\n\nClaude: [Creates TASKS.md, CLAUDE.md, memory/ directory, and dashboard.html]\n        [Opens the dashboard in your browser]\n        [Asks about your role, team, and current priorities to seed memory]\n```\n\n### Adding Tasks Naturally\n\n```\nYou: I need to review the budget proposal for Sarah by Friday,\n     draft the Q2 roadmap after syncing with Greg, and follow up\n     on the API spec from the Platform team\n\nClaude: [Adds all three tasks to TASKS.md with context]\n        [Dashboard updates automatically]\n```\n\n### Morning Sync\n\n```\nYou: /update --comprehensive\n\nClaude: [Scans email, calendar, and chat for new action items]\n        [Flags: \"Budget proposal review is due tomorrow — still open\"]\n        [Suggests: \"New person mentioned in 3 threads: Jamie Park,\n         Design Lead — add to memory?\"]\n        [Updates stale tasks and fills memory gaps]\n```\n\n### Workplace Shorthand\n\nOnce memory is populated, Claude decodes your shorthand instantly:\n\n```\nYou: ask todd to do the PSR for oracle\n\nClaude: \"Ask Todd Martinez (Finance lead) to prepare the Pipeline\n         Status Report for the Oracle Systems deal ($2.3M, closing Q2)\"\n```\n\nNo clarifying questions. No round trips.\n\n## Data Sources\n\n> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).\n\nConnect your communication and project management tools for the best experience. Without them, manage tasks and memory manually.\n\n**Included MCP connections:**\n- Chat (Slack) for team context and message scanning\n- Email and calendar (Microsoft 365) for action item discovery\n- Knowledge base (Notion) for reference documents\n- Project tracker (Asana, Linear, Atlassian, monday.com, ClickUp) for task syncing\n- Office suite (Microsoft 365) for documents\n\n**Additional options:**\n- See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for alternative tools in each category\n",
        "enterprise-search/README.md": "# Enterprise Search\n\nAn enterprise search plugin primarily designed for [Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), Anthropic's agentic desktop application — though it also works in Claude Code. Search across all your company's tools in one place — email, chat, documents, and wikis — without switching between apps.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\nOne query searches all your connected tools simultaneously. Claude decomposes your question, runs targeted searches across every source, and synthesizes the results into a single coherent answer with source attribution.\n\n```\nYou: \"What did we decide about the API redesign?\"\n              ↓ Claude searches\n~~chat: #engineering thread from Tuesday with the decision\n~~email: Follow-up email from Sarah with the spec\n~~cloud storage: Updated API design doc (modified yesterday)\n              ↓ Claude synthesizes\n\"The team decided on Tuesday to go with REST over GraphQL.\n Sarah sent the updated spec Thursday. The design doc\n reflects the final approach.\"\n```\n\nNo tab switching. No remembering which tool has what. Ask the question, get the answer.\n\n---\n\n## What It Searches\n\n> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).\n\nConnect any combination of sources. The more you connect, the more complete your answers.\n\n| Source | What it finds |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **~~chat** | Messages, threads, channels, DMs |\n| **~~email** | Emails, attachments, conversations |\n| **~~cloud storage** | Docs, sheets, slides, PDFs |\n| **Wiki / Knowledge Base** | Internal documentation, runbooks |\n| **Project Management** | Tasks, issues, epics, milestones |\n| **CRM** | Accounts, contacts, opportunities |\n| **Ticketing** | Support tickets, customer issues |\n\nEach source is an MCP connection. Add more sources in your MCP settings to expand what Claude can search.\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/search` | Search across all connected sources in one query |\n| `/digest` | Generate a daily or weekly digest of activity across all sources |\n\n### Search\n\n```\n/enterprise-search:search what's the status of Project Aurora?\n/enterprise-search:search from:sarah about:budget after:2025-01-01\n/enterprise-search:search decisions made in #product this week\n```\n\nSupports filters: `from:`, `in:`, `after:`, `before:`, `type:` — applied intelligently across each source's native query syntax.\n\n### Digest\n\n```\n/enterprise-search:digest --daily      # What happened today across all sources\n/enterprise-search:digest --weekly     # Weekly rollup grouped by project/topic\n```\n\nHighlights action items, decisions, and mentions of you. Groups activity by topic so you can skim what matters.\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\nThree skills power the search experience:\n\n**Search Strategy** — Query decomposition and source-specific translation. Breaks your natural language question into targeted searches per source, handles ambiguity, and falls back gracefully when sources are unavailable.\n\n**Source Management** — Knows which MCP sources are available, guides you to connect new ones, manages source priority, and handles rate limits.\n\n**Knowledge Synthesis** — Combines results from multiple sources into coherent answers. Deduplicates cross-source information, attributes sources, scores confidence based on freshness and authority, and summarizes large result sets.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Finding a decision\n\n```\nYou: /enterprise-search:search when did we decide to switch to Postgres?\n\nClaude searches:\n  ~~chat → #engineering, #infrastructure for \"postgres\" \"switch\" \"decision\"\n  ~~email → threads with \"postgres\" in subject\n  ~~cloud storage → docs mentioning database migration\n\nResult: \"The decision was made March 3 in #infrastructure (link).\n         Sarah's email on March 4 confirmed the timeline.\n         The migration plan doc was updated March 5.\"\n```\n\n### Catching up after time off\n\n```\nYou: /enterprise-search:digest --weekly\n\nClaude scans:\n  ~~chat → channels you're in, DMs, mentions\n  ~~email → inbox activity\n  ~~cloud storage → docs shared with you or modified\n\nResult: Grouped summary by project with action items\n        flagged and decisions highlighted.\n```\n\n### Finding an expert\n\n```\nYou: /enterprise-search:search who knows about our Kubernetes setup?\n\nClaude searches:\n  ~~chat → messages about Kubernetes, k8s, clusters\n  ~~cloud storage → docs authored about infrastructure\n  Wiki → runbooks and architecture docs\n\nResult: \"Based on message history and doc authorship,\n         Alex and Priya are your go-to people for k8s.\n         Here's the main runbook (link).\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install\nclaude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/enterprise-search\n\n# 2. Search across everything\n/enterprise-search:search [your question here]\n\n# 3. Get a digest\n/enterprise-search:digest --daily\n```\n\nThe more sources you connect via MCP, the more complete your search results. Start with ~~chat, ~~email, and ~~cloud storage, then add your wiki, project management tool, and CRM as needed.\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nKnowledge workers spend hours every week hunting for information scattered across tools. The answer exists somewhere — in a Slack thread, an email chain, a doc, a wiki page — but finding it means searching each tool individually, cross-referencing results, and hoping you checked the right place.\n\nEnterprise Search treats all your tools as one searchable knowledge base. One query, all sources, synthesized results. Your company's knowledge shouldn't be locked in silos. Search everything at once.\n",

Automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance workflows, legal briefings, and templated responses -- all configurable to your organization's specific playbook and risk tolerances.\n\n> **Disclaimer:** This plugin assists with legal workflows but does not provide legal advice. Always verify conclusions with qualified legal professionals. AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions.\n\n## Target Personas\n\n- **Commercial Counsel** -- Contract negotiation, vendor management, deal support\n- **Product Counsel** -- Product reviews, terms of service, privacy policies, IP matters\n- **Privacy / Compliance** -- Data protection regulations, DPA reviews, data subject requests, regulatory monitoring\n- **Litigation Support** -- Discovery holds, document review prep, case briefings\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nclaude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/legal\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Install the plugin\n\n```\nclaude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/legal\n```\n\n### 2. Configure your playbook\n\nCreate a local settings file to define your organization's standard positions. This is where you encode your team's negotiation playbook, risk tolerances, and standard terms.\n\nIn your project's `.claude/` directory, create a `legal.local.md` file:\n\n```markdown\n# Legal Playbook Configuration\n\n## Contract Review Positions\n\n### Limitation of Liability\n- Standard position: Mutual cap at 12 months of fees paid/payable\n- Acceptable range: 6-24 months of fees\n- Escalation trigger: Uncapped liability, consequential damages inclusion\n\n### Indemnification\n- Standard position: Mutual indemnification for IP infringement and data breach\n- Acceptable: Indemnification limited to third-party claims only\n- Escalation trigger: Unilateral indemnification obligations, uncapped indemnification\n\n### IP Ownership\n- Standard position: Each party retains pre-existing IP; customer owns customer data\n- Escalation trigger: Broad IP assignment clauses, work-for-hire provisions for pre-existing IP\n\n### Data Protection\n- Standard position: Require DPA for any personal data processing\n- Requirements: Sub-processor notification, data deletion on termination, breach notification within 72 hours\n- Escalation trigger: No DPA offered, cross-border transfer without safeguards\n\n### Term and Termination\n- Standard position: Annual term with 30-day termination for convenience\n- Acceptable: Multi-year with termination for convenience after initial term\n- Escalation trigger: Auto-renewal without notice period, no termination for convenience\n\n### Governing Law\n- Preferred: [Your jurisdiction]\n- Acceptable: Major commercial jurisdictions (NY, DE, CA, England & Wales)\n- Escalation trigger: Non-standard jurisdictions, mandatory arbitration in unfavorable venue\n\n## NDA Defaults\n- Mutual obligations required\n- Term: 2-3 years standard, 5 years for trade secrets\n- Standard carveouts: independently developed, publicly available, rightfully received from third party\n- Residuals clause: acceptable if narrowly scoped\n\n## Response Templates\nConfigure paths to your template files or define inline templates for common inquiries.\n```\n\n### 3. Connect your tools\n\nThe plugin works best when connected to your existing tools via MCP. Pre-configured servers include Slack, Box, Egnyte, Atlassian, and Microsoft 365. See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for the full list of supported categories and options.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/review-contract` -- Contract Review Against Playbook\n\nReview a contract against your organization's negotiation playbook. Flags deviations, generates redlines, and provides business impact analysis.\n\n```\n/review-contract\n```\n\nAccepts: file upload, URL, or pasted contract text. Will ask for context (your side, deadline, focus areas) and review clause-by-clause against your configured playbook.\n\n### `/triage-nda` -- NDA Pre-Screening\n\nRapid triage of incoming NDAs against standard criteria. Categorizes as GREEN (standard approval), YELLOW (counsel review), or RED (significant issues).\n\n```\n/triage-nda\n```\n\n### `/vendor-check` -- Vendor Agreement Status\n\nCheck the status of existing agreements with a vendor across your connected systems.\n\n```\n/vendor-check [vendor name]\n```\n\nReports on existing NDAs, MSAs, DPAs, expiration dates, and key terms.\n\n### `/brief` -- Legal Team Briefing\n\nGenerate contextual briefings for your legal work.\n\n```\n/brief daily          # Morning brief of legal-relevant items\n/brief topic [query]  # Research brief on a specific legal question\n/brief incident       # Rapid brief on a developing situation\n```\n\n### `/respond` -- Generate Templated Response\n\nGenerate a response from your configured templates for common inquiry types.\n\n```\n/respond [inquiry-type]\n```\n\nSupported inquiry types include: data subject request, discovery hold, vendor question, NDA request, and custom categories you define.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `contract-review` | Playbook-based contract analysis, deviation classification, redline generation |\n| `nda-triage` | NDA screening criteria, classification rules, routing recommendations |\n| `compliance` | Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), DPA review, data subject requests |\n| `canned-responses` | Template management, response categories, escalation triggers |\n| `legal-risk-assessment` | Risk severity framework, classification levels, escalation criteria |\n| `meeting-briefing` | Meeting prep methodology, context gathering, action item tracking |\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Contract Review\n\n1. Receive a vendor contract via email\n2. Run `/review-contract` and upload the document\n3. Provide context: \"We are the customer, need to close by end of quarter, focus on data protection and liability\"\n4. Receive clause-by-clause analysis with GREEN/YELLOW/RED flags\n5. Get specific redline language for YELLOW and RED items\n6. Share the analysis with your deal team\n\n### NDA Triage\n\n1. Sales team sends an NDA from a new prospect\n2. Run `/triage-nda` and paste or upload the NDA\n3. Get instant classification: GREEN (route for signature), YELLOW (specific issues to review), or RED (needs full counsel review)\n4. For GREEN NDAs, approve directly; for YELLOW/RED, address flagged issues\n\n### Daily Brief\n\n1. Start your morning with `/brief daily`\n2. Get a summary of overnight contract requests, compliance questions, upcoming deadlines, and calendar items needing legal prep\n3. Prioritize your day based on urgency and deadlines\n\n### Vendor Check\n\n1. Business team asks about a new engagement with an existing vendor\n2. Run `/vendor-check Acme Corp`\n3. See existing agreements, expiration dates, and key terms at a glance\n4. Know immediately whether you need a new NDA or can proceed under existing terms\n\n## MCP Integration\n\n> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md).\n\nThe plugin connects to your tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:\n\n| Category | Examples | Purpose |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| Chat | Slack, Teams | Team requests, notifications, triage |\n| Cloud storage | Box, Egnyte | Playbooks, templates, precedents |\n| Office suite | Microsoft 365 | Email, calendar, documents |\n| Project tracker | Atlassian (Jira/Confluence) | Matter tracking, tasks |\n\nSee [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for the full list of supported integrations, including CLM, CRM, e-signature, and additional options.\n\nConfigure connections in `.mcp.json`. The plugin gracefully degrades when tools are unavailable -- it will note gaps and suggest manual checks.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Playbook Configuration\n\nYour playbook is the heart of the contract review system. Define your positions in `legal.local.md`:\n\n- **Standard positions**: Your preferred contract terms\n- **Acceptable ranges**: What you can agree to without escalation\n- **Escalation triggers**: Terms that require senior review or outside counsel\n\n### Response Templates\n\nDefine templates for common inquiries. Templates support variable substitution and include built-in escalation triggers for situations that should not use a templated response.\n\n### Risk Framework\n\nCustomize the risk assessment matrix to match your organization's risk appetite and classification scheme.\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nlegal/\n├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json\n├── .mcp.json\n├── README.md\n├── commands/\n│   ├── review-contract.md\n│   ├── triage-nda.md\n│   ├── vendor-check.md\n│   ├── brief.md\n│   └── respond.md\n└── skills/\n    ├── contract-review/SKILL.md\n    ├── nda-triage/SKILL.md\n    ├── compliance/SKILL.md\n    ├── canned-responses/SKILL.md\n    ├── legal-risk-assessment/SKILL.md\n    └── meeting-briefing/SKILL.md\n```\n",
