        "README.md": "[![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)\n\n# Modern Go Guidelines\n\nThis repository contains guidelines for code agents that help them write modern Go code.\n\nFor example, an agent with these guidelines uses `max(a, b)` instead of an if-else block, `slices.Contains` instead of a manual loop, `cmp.Or(a, b, c)` instead of a chain of nil checks. It also knows about recent additions like `new(42)` to get a pointer to a value and `errors.AsType[T](err)` for type-safe error matching—both from Go 1.26.\n\nThe guidelines cover the most useful features from Go 1.0 through Go 1.26, including everything targeted by the `modernize` analyzer. An agent will:\n\n- Detect the project's Go version from `go.mod`\n- Use language features and stdlib additions available up to and including that version\n- Prefer modern idioms over older patterns\n\n## Motivation\n\nAll coding agents tend to generate outdated Go. Two reasons:\n\n1. **Training data lag.** Models don't know about features added after their training cutoff. They can't use `errors.AsType[T]` (Go 1.26) if they've never seen it.\n\n2. **Frequency bias.** Even for features the model knows, it often picks older patterns. There's more `for i := 0; i < n; i++` in the training data than `for i := range n`, so that's what comes out.\n\nThese guidelines fix both problems by giving the agent an explicit reference.\n\nThis aligns with the Go team's direction. The `modernize` analyzer exists to automatically update existing code to use newer idioms (see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU) from the Go team). These guidelines serve the same goal for new code: agents write modern Go from the start, so there's less to fix later.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe guidelines are available for Junie and Claude Code.\n\n### [Junie](https://junie.jetbrains.com)\n\nStarting with version 2xx.620.xx, Junie includes the modern Go guidelines out of the box. No manual setup is required — just make sure you're running a compatible version.\n\n#### Updating Junie\n\nGo to **Settings → Plugins → Installed**, find Junie, and click **Update** if a newer version is available.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe guidelines are controlled via **Settings → Tools → Junie → Project Settings → Go**. The **Provide modern Go guidelines** option is enabled by default. Disable it if you prefer Junie to generate code without these guidelines.\n\n### [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)\n\nFor convenience, the guidelines are distributed as a Claude Code plugin.\n\n#### Installation\nRun the following commands inside a Claude Code session.\n\n1. Add this repository as a marketplace:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add JetBrains/go-modern-guidelines\n```\n\n2. Install the plugin:\n```\n/plugin install modern-go-guidelines\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\nThe plugin adds the `/use-modern-go` command. Run it at the start of a session to activate the guidelines:\n\n```\n/use-modern-go\n```\n\nThe command detects the Go version from `go.mod` and tells the agent to use features up to that version:\n\n```\n> /use-modern-go\n\nThis project is using Go 1.24, so I'll stick to modern Go best practices\nand freely use language features up to and including this version.\nIf you'd prefer a different target version, just let me know.\n```\n\nAfter this, any Go code the agent writes will follow the guidelines.\n"
