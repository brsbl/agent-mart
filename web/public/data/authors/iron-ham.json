        "README.md": "# Claude Deep Review\n\nA comprehensive code review skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that combines architecture analysis, code review, error handling audit, type design analysis, comment verification, test coverage analysis, accessibility audit, localization review, concurrency analysis, performance analysis, and code simplification into a single command.\n\n## Features\n\n- **15 specialized review agents** running in parallel via team-based orchestration\n- **File-based data flow** — agent findings written to files, keeping context windows lightweight\n- **Dedicated synthesis** — a separate agent merges all findings with a fresh context window\n- **Flexible scope detection** — review PR changes, uncommitted work, or specific paths\n- **Modular aspects** — run all agents or select specific review types\n- **Prioritized output** — issues categorized as Critical, Important, or Suggestions\n- **Architecture health assessment** — dependency mapping, cycle detection, hotspot analysis\n- **Graceful partial failure** — if some agents fail, the report notes gaps without blocking\n- **Standalone** — no dependencies on other plugins\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Plugin marketplace (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install deep-review@claude-deep-review\n```\n\nTo update later:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update\n```\n\n### Option 2: Clone to skills directory\n\n```bash\n# Clone to your global skills directory\ngit clone https://github.com/Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review.git ~/.claude/skills/deep-review\n```\n\n### Option 3: Project-specific installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone to a specific project's skills directory\ngit clone https://github.com/Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review.git /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/deep-review\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\n# Review current PR/branch changes (default)\n/deep-review\n\n# Explicit PR scope\n/deep-review --pr\n\n# Review uncommitted changes only\n/deep-review --changes\n\n# Review a specific path\n/deep-review src/features\n```\n\n### Selecting Review Aspects\n\n```bash\n# Full review with all 15 agents\n/deep-review full\n\n# Code quality + error handling only\n/deep-review code errors\n\n# Type design + test coverage analysis\n/deep-review types tests\n\n# Architecture analysis only\n/deep-review arch\n\n# Performance analysis\n/deep-review perf\n\n# Code simplification suggestions\n/deep-review simplify\n```\n\n### Combined Examples\n\n```bash\n# Full review of PR changes\n/deep-review full --pr\n\n# Quick core review of uncommitted changes\n/deep-review --changes\n\n# Type and test analysis of specific directory\n/deep-review types tests src/models\n\n# Accessibility audit of PR\n/deep-review a11y --pr\n\n# Performance analysis of PR\n/deep-review perf --pr\n```\n\n## Review Aspects\n\n| Aspect | Description | Agents |\n|--------|-------------|--------|\n| `core` | Essential quality checks (default) | Code Reviewer, Silent Failure Hunter, 5 Architecture agents |\n| `full` | Complete comprehensive review | All 15 agents |\n| `code` | CLAUDE.md compliance, bugs, quality | Code Reviewer |\n| `errors` | Silent failures, catch blocks | Silent Failure Hunter |\n| `arch` | Dependencies, cycles, hotspots, patterns, scale | 5 Architecture agents |\n| `types` | Type invariants, encapsulation | Type Design Analyzer |\n| `comments` | Comment accuracy, rot detection | Comment Analyzer |\n| `tests` | Test coverage, quality, gaps | Test Analyzer |\n| `simplify` | Code clarity, refactoring | Code Simplifier |\n| `a11y` | WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers | Accessibility Scanner |\n| `l10n` | Hardcoded strings, i18n readiness, locale handling, RTL | Localization Scanner |\n| `concurrency` | Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety, async pitfalls | Concurrency Analyzer |\n| `perf` | Algorithmic complexity, allocations, caching, rendering, N+1 queries | Performance Analyzer |\n\n## Agents\n\n### Code Quality Agents\n\n- **Code Reviewer** - Reviews code against project guidelines (CLAUDE.md), detects bugs, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues. Only reports issues with confidence ≥80%.\n\n- **Silent Failure Hunter** - Audits error handling for silent failures, inadequate catch blocks, and missing user feedback. Zero tolerance for swallowed errors.\n\n### Architecture Agents\n\n- **Dependency Mapper** - Maps module dependencies, identifies layers, flags violations and high fan-in/fan-out modules.\n\n- **Cycle Detector** - Finds circular dependencies and bidirectional imports that create maintenance nightmares.\n\n- **Hotspot Analyzer** - Identifies coupling hotspots, \"god modules,\" and files that are too large.\n\n- **Pattern Scout** - Checks for consistency in conventions across modules, identifies drift.\n\n- **Scale Assessor** - Identifies scalability risks as the codebase grows.\n\n### Specialized Agents\n\n- **Type Design Analyzer** - Evaluates type designs for invariant strength, encapsulation, and enforcement. Rates each aspect 1-10.\n\n- **Comment Analyzer** - Verifies comment accuracy, identifies rot, and flags misleading documentation.\n\n- **Test Analyzer** - Reviews test coverage quality, identifies critical gaps, and flags anti-patterns.\n\n- **Code Simplifier** - Suggests simplifications for clarity and maintainability while preserving functionality.\n\n- **Accessibility Scanner** - Audits code for WCAG 2.2 compliance, ARIA correctness, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and assistive technology compatibility.\n\n- **Localization Scanner** - Identifies hardcoded strings, locale-unsafe operations, broken pluralization, and i18n/l10n gaps that would degrade the experience for international users.\n\n- **Concurrency Analyzer** - Detects race conditions, deadlocks, thread-safety violations, async/await pitfalls, and concurrency model mismatches across languages and frameworks.\n\n- **Performance Analyzer** - Identifies algorithmic complexity issues, excessive allocations, N+1 queries, rendering bottlenecks, bundle bloat, and missed caching/parallelization opportunities.\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe skill produces a synthesized report with:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** - Scope, agents run, issue counts\n2. **New Issues** (from this PR) - Critical, Important, Suggestions\n3. **Pre-existing Issues** (technical debt) - Tracked separately, do not block merge\n4. **Architecture Health** - Table of checks with pass/fail\n5. **Strengths** - What's done well\n6. **Action Plan** - Prioritized next steps\n\nIndividual agent findings are also available in `/tmp/deep-review-*/` for detailed inspection.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI\n- Git (for scope detection)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Scope Detection** — Determines which files to analyze based on flags (`--pr`, `--changes`) or path argument\n\n2. **Agent Selection** — Selects which agents to run based on specified aspects\n\n3. **Team Initialization** — Creates a team and results directory, then spawns all selected agents as teammates in parallel\n\n4. **Parallel Analysis** — Each agent reads its instructions from a dedicated file, analyzes the code, and writes findings to its own output file in `/tmp/deep-review-*/`\n\n5. **Synthesis** — A dedicated synthesis agent reads all output files and merges them into a unified, deduplicated report\n\n6. **Report & Cleanup** — The final report is presented to the user and the team is cleaned up\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nclaude-deep-review/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json              # Plugin manifest\n│   └── marketplace.json         # Marketplace catalog\n├── skills/\n│   └── deep-review/\n│       ├── SKILL.md             # Skill orchestration (6-phase team workflow)\n│       └── agents/              # Agent definitions (pure instructions)\n│           ├── code-reviewer.md\n│           ├── silent-failure-hunter.md\n│           ├── dependency-mapper.md\n│           ├── cycle-detector.md\n│           ├── hotspot-analyzer.md\n│           ├── pattern-scout.md\n│           ├── scale-assessor.md\n│           ├── type-design-analyzer.md\n│           ├── comment-analyzer.md\n│           ├── test-analyzer.md\n│           ├── code-simplifier.md\n│           ├── accessibility-scanner.md\n│           ├── localization-scanner.md\n│           ├── concurrency-analyzer.md\n│           ├── performance-analyzer.md\n│           └── synthesizer.md\n├── README.md\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- Run `/deep-review` before creating a PR to catch issues early\n- Use `core` (default) for quick essential checks during development\n- Use `full` before major merges or releases\n- **Focus on [NEW] issues** - these must be fixed before merge\n- **[PRE-EXISTING] issues** are technical debt to track, not PR blockers\n- Re-run after fixes to verify resolution\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
