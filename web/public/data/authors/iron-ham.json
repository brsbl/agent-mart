        "README.md": "# Claude Deep Review\n\nA comprehensive code review skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that combines architecture analysis, code review, error handling audit, type design analysis, comment verification, test coverage analysis, accessibility audit, localization review, concurrency analysis, performance analysis, and code simplification into a single command.\n\n## Features\n\n- **33 specialized review agents** running in parallel via team-based orchestration\n- **File-based data flow** — agent findings written to files, keeping context windows lightweight\n- **Dedicated synthesis** — a separate agent merges all findings with a fresh context window\n- **Flexible scope detection** — review PR changes, uncommitted work, or specific paths\n- **Modular aspects** — run all agents or select specific review types\n- **Prioritized output** — issues categorized as Critical, Important, or Suggestions\n- **Architecture health assessment** — dependency mapping, cycle detection, hotspot analysis\n- **Graceful partial failure** — if some agents fail, the report notes gaps without blocking\n- **Standalone** — no dependencies on other plugins\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Plugin marketplace (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install deep-review@claude-deep-review\n```\n\nTo update later:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update\n```\n\n### Option 2: Clone to skills directory\n\n```bash\n# Clone to your global skills directory\ngit clone https://github.com/Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review.git ~/.claude/skills/deep-review\n```\n\n### Option 3: Project-specific installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone to a specific project's skills directory\ngit clone https://github.com/Iron-Ham/claude-deep-review.git /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/deep-review\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\n# Review current PR/branch changes (default)\n/deep-review\n\n# Explicit PR scope\n/deep-review --pr\n\n# Review uncommitted changes only\n/deep-review --changes\n\n# Review a specific path\n/deep-review src/features\n```\n\n### Selecting Review Aspects\n\n```bash\n# Full review with all cross-cutting agents (+ auto-detected platforms)\n/deep-review full\n\n# Code quality + error handling only\n/deep-review code errors\n\n# Type design + test coverage analysis\n/deep-review types tests\n\n# Architecture analysis only\n/deep-review arch\n\n# Performance analysis\n/deep-review perf\n\n# Code simplification suggestions\n/deep-review simplify\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Reviews\n\n```bash\n# Explicitly include iOS reviewer\n/deep-review ios --pr\n\n# Both TypeScript frontend + backend reviewers\n/deep-review ts --pr\n\n# iOS + Android reviewers\n/deep-review mobile --pr\n\n# Python and Rust reviewers\n/deep-review python rust --pr\n```\n\nPlatform reviewers are also **automatically included** when the changed files are relevant to a specific platform. For example, running `/deep-review` on a project with iOS Swift changes will include the iOS reviewer. The system uses its judgment to disambiguate — `.swift` files in a macOS project won't trigger the iOS reviewer, and `.ts` files in an Express app will trigger the backend reviewer, not the frontend one.\n\n### Combined Examples\n\n```bash\n# Full review of PR changes (+ auto-detected platforms)\n/deep-review full --pr\n\n# Quick core review of uncommitted changes\n/deep-review --changes\n\n# Type and test analysis of specific directory\n/deep-review types tests src/models\n\n# Accessibility audit of PR\n/deep-review a11y --pr\n\n# Performance analysis of PR\n/deep-review perf --pr\n```\n\n## Review Aspects\n\n| Aspect | Description | Agents |\n|--------|-------------|--------|\n| `core` | Essential quality checks (default) | Code Reviewer, Silent Failure Hunter, 5 Architecture agents |\n| `full` | All cross-cutting agents | All 15 cross-cutting agents |\n| `code` | CLAUDE.md compliance, bugs, quality | Code Reviewer |\n| `errors` | Silent failures, catch blocks | Silent Failure Hunter |\n| `arch` | Dependencies, cycles, hotspots, patterns, scale | 5 Architecture agents |\n| `types` | Type invariants, encapsulation | Type Design Analyzer |\n| `comments` | Comment accuracy, rot detection | Comment Analyzer |\n| `tests` | Test coverage, quality, gaps | Test Analyzer |\n| `simplify` | Code clarity, refactoring | Code Simplifier |\n| `a11y` | WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers | Accessibility Scanner |\n| `l10n` | Hardcoded strings, i18n readiness, locale handling, RTL | Localization Scanner |\n| `concurrency` | Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety, async pitfalls | Concurrency Analyzer |\n| `perf` | Algorithmic complexity, allocations, caching, rendering, N+1 queries | Performance Analyzer |\n\n**Platform-specific aspects** (automatically included when relevant, or explicitly requested):\n\n| Aspect | Description | Agents |\n|--------|-------------|--------|\n| `ios` | Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, ARC, Apple APIs | iOS Platform Reviewer |\n| `android` | Activity/Fragment lifecycle, Compose, Android security | Android Platform Reviewer |\n| `ts-frontend` | React/Vue/Angular state, SSR/hydration, browser APIs | TypeScript Frontend Reviewer |\n| `ts-backend` | Node.js event loop, middleware, ORM, API design | TypeScript Backend Reviewer |\n| `python` | Pythonic idioms, type hints, Django/FastAPI/Flask | Python Reviewer |\n| `rust` | Ownership idioms, unsafe auditing, trait design | Rust Reviewer |\n| `go` | Go idioms, interface design, context propagation | Go Reviewer |\n| `rails` | Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, migration safety | Rails Reviewer |\n| `flutter` | Widget design, state management, Dart idioms | Flutter Reviewer |\n| `java` | Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, bean lifecycle | Java Reviewer |\n| `dotnet` | ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, LINQ, C# idioms | .NET Reviewer |\n| `php` | Laravel, Composer, Eloquent, PHP 8+ features | PHP Reviewer |\n| `cpp` | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20), memory safety, RAII | C/C++ Reviewer |\n| `react-native` | Bridge perf, native modules, platform code paths | React Native Reviewer |\n| `svelte` | Svelte reactivity, SvelteKit routing, compile-time | Svelte Reviewer |\n| `elixir` | OTP/GenServer, Phoenix LiveView, BEAM concurrency | Elixir Reviewer |\n| `kotlin-server` | Ktor, coroutines, Kotlin server-side idioms | Kotlin Server Reviewer |\n| `scala` | Functional patterns, Akka/Spark, effect systems | Scala Reviewer |\n| `mobile` | iOS + Android combined | iOS + Android Platform Reviewers |\n| `ts` | TypeScript frontend + backend combined | Both TypeScript Reviewers |\n| `jvm` | Java + Kotlin Server + Scala combined | All JVM Reviewers |\n\n## Agents\n\n### Code Quality Agents\n\n- **Code Reviewer** - Reviews code against project guidelines (CLAUDE.md), detects bugs, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues.

Scope, agents run, issue counts\n2. **New Issues** (from this PR) - Critical, Important, Suggestions\n3. **Pre-existing Issues** (technical debt) - Tracked separately, do not block merge\n4. **Architecture Health** - Table of checks with pass/fail\n5. **Strengths** - What's done well\n6. **Action Plan** - Prioritized next steps\n\nIndividual agent findings are also available in `/tmp/deep-review-*/` for detailed inspection.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI\n- Git (for scope detection)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Scope Detection** — Determines which files to analyze based on flags (`--pr`, `--changes`) or path argument\n\n2. **Platform Detection** — Examines changed files and project context to automatically include relevant platform-specific reviewers (e.g., Swift changes in an iOS project trigger the iOS reviewer)\n\n3. **Agent Selection** — Selects which agents to run based on specified aspects and detected platforms\n\n4. **Team Initialization** — Creates a team and results directory, then spawns all selected agents as teammates in parallel\n\n5. **Parallel Analysis** — Each agent reads its instructions from a dedicated file, analyzes the code, and writes findings to its own output file in `/tmp/deep-review-*/`\n\n6. **Synthesis** — A dedicated synthesis agent reads all output files and merges them into a unified, deduplicated report\n\n7. **Report & Cleanup** — The final report is presented to the user and the team is cleaned up\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nclaude-deep-review/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json              # Plugin manifest\n│   └── marketplace.json         # Marketplace catalog\n├── skills/\n│   └── deep-review/\n│       ├── SKILL.md             # Skill orchestration (6-phase team workflow)\n│       └── agents/              # Agent definitions (pure instructions)\n│           ├── code-reviewer.md\n│           ├── silent-failure-hunter.md\n│           ├── dependency-mapper.md\n│           ├── cycle-detector.md\n│           ├── hotspot-analyzer.md\n│           ├── pattern-scout.md\n│           ├── scale-assessor.md\n│           ├── type-design-analyzer.md\n│           ├── comment-analyzer.md\n│           ├── test-analyzer.md\n│           ├── code-simplifier.md\n│           ├── accessibility-scanner.md\n│           ├── localization-scanner.md\n│           ├── concurrency-analyzer.md\n│           ├── performance-analyzer.md\n│           ├── ios-platform-reviewer.md\n│           ├── android-platform-reviewer.md\n│           ├── ts-frontend-reviewer.md\n│           ├── ts-backend-reviewer.md\n│           ├── python-reviewer.md\n│           ├── rust-reviewer.md\n│           ├── go-reviewer.md\n│           ├── rails-reviewer.md\n│           ├── flutter-reviewer.md\n│           ├── java-reviewer.md\n│           ├── dotnet-reviewer.md\n│           ├── php-reviewer.md\n│           ├── cpp-reviewer.md\n│           ├── react-native-reviewer.md\n│           ├── svelte-reviewer.md\n│           ├── elixir-reviewer.md\n│           ├── kotlin-server-reviewer.md\n│           ├── scala-reviewer.md\n│           └── synthesizer.md\n├── README.md\n└── LICENSE\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- Run `/deep-review` before creating a PR to catch issues early\n- Use `core` (default) for quick essential checks during development\n- Use `full` before major merges or releases\n- **Focus on [NEW] issues** - these must be fixed before merge\n- **[PRE-EXISTING] issues** are technical debt to track, not PR blockers\n- Platform reviewers are automatically included when relevant — no need to specify `ios`, `python`, etc. manually\n- Use `mobile`, `ts`, or explicit platform names to force platform reviewers when needed\n- Re-run after fixes to verify resolution\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
