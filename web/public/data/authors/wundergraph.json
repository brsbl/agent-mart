You can also invoke it explicitly:\n\n```\nUse the graphql-federation skill to create an entity type for my user service\n```\n\n## What's Included\n\n| File | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `skills/graphql-federation/SKILL.md` | Core skill with essential directives, patterns, and error prevention |\n| `skills/graphql-federation/references/directives.md` | Complete specification of all 14 federation directives |\n| `skills/graphql-federation/references/composition-rules.md` | All validation rules for successful composition |\n| `skills/graphql-federation/references/patterns.md` | Advanced patterns for real-world federation scenarios |\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n"
