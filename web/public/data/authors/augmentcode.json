The Augment Context Engine MCP delivers deep semantic understanding across large, long-lived codebases, including architecture, dependencies, and history. Use it to move beyond file-level prompts, plan changes with confidence, and automate complex tasks safely. Make system-level context a native input to your agents so AI can operate reliably on real-world production software.\n\n## What's Included\n\nThis plugin provides:\n\n- **MCP Server** - Connects Claude Code to Augment's context engine service\n- **Skills** - Auto-triggers codebase retrieval when you ask about your code\n- **Agents** - A dedicated `context-expert` agent for focused code localization\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add augmentcode/augment-plugin\nclaude plugin install augment-context-engine@augment-marketplace\n```\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### codebase-retrieval\n\nSearches your codebase using natural language queries and returns relevant code snippets.\n\n```\nInput: \"Where is user authentication handled?\"\nOutput: Relevant code snippets with file paths and line numbers\n```\n\nKey features:\n- Uses proprietary retrieval/embedding models for high-quality recall\n- Maintains a real-time index of your codebase\n- Retrieves across different programming languages\n- Reflects the current state of files on disk\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe plugin works automatically when you ask about your codebase:\n\n- \"Where is the function that handles user authentication?\"\n- \"What tests are there for the login functionality?\"\n- \"How is the database connected to the application?\"\n- \"Where should I add a new API endpoint?\"\n\nOr spawn the context-expert agent when you want focused code localization:\n\n```\nspawn context-expert to find all the payment processing code\n```\n\n## When to Use\n\nThe codebase-retrieval tool is ideal for:\n\n- **Finding code locations** - Locate functions, classes, or implementations\n- **Understanding structure** - Learn how different parts of the codebase connect\n- **Planning changes** - Identify all files that need modification\n- **Finding tests** - Locate existing tests for specific functionality\n- **Code exploration** - Discover how features are implemented\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Be specific**: Detailed queries yield better results\n- **Use natural language**: Describe what you're looking for conceptually\n- **Iterate**: If initial results aren't helpful, try alternative terminology\n- **Combine with other tools**: Use results to guide further exploration with file viewing\n\n"
