        "README.md": "# Research-OS\n\n**An agentic research engineering ecosystem for Claude Code**\n\nResearch-OS is an orchestration system built on top of Claude Code that combines rigorous research planning with spec- and test-driven engineering. It provides a structured workflow for transforming research ideas into fully implemented, production-ready code through spec- and test-driven development principles with sophisticated context engineering.\n\n## Overview\n\nResearch-OS separates the cognitive work of research planning from the execution work of engineering implementation through two specialized, marketplace-compatible plugins that can be used independently or together:\n\n- **Researcher Plugin**: Focuses on hypothesis development, literature review, and experiment planning\n- **Engineer Plugin**: Handles spec-driven development with implementation and verification workflows\n\nThis separation enables:\n- Clear distinction between \"what to build\" (research) and \"how to build it\" (engineering)\n- Reusable research artifacts that inform multiple implementations\n- Professional development practices with automated verification\n- Sophisticated context engineering through standards and templates\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 🔬 Research-First Development\n- Systematic hypothesis refinement and validation\n- Comprehensive literature review and related work analysis\n- Experiment roadmap with dependency tracking\n- Mission-driven project planning\n\n### 🏗️ Spec-Driven Implementation\n- Requirements gathering with visual asset support\n- Detailed specification generation\n- Strategic task breakdown with agent assignments\n- Automated verification and testing\n\n### 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration\n- 19 specialized agents across research and engineering domains\n- Intelligent task delegation based on agent expertise\n- Parallel execution for independent tasks\n- Context passing between agents via file artifacts\n\n### 📐 Standards & Quality\n- Customizable coding standards and conventions\n- Automatic code quality checks (via ruff)\n- Test-driven development support\n- Comprehensive documentation at every phase\n\n## Installation\n\nResearch-OS is compatible with the Claude Code marketplace and plugin system. Add this marketplace to Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add wielandbrendel/research-os\n```\n\nThen browse and install individual plugins (commands or agents):\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nFor more details on the Claude Code plugin system, see the [official documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Phase 0: Idea Brainstorming (Optional but Recommended)\n\nStart by brainstorming and refining your initial research idea:\n\n**Step 1:** Create `research-os/project/idea.md` with your initial research concept:\n```markdown\n# Initial Research Idea\n\n[Your research idea, hypothesis, or problem statement]\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Run the brainstorm command:\n```bash\n/brainstorm\n```\n\nThis iterative refinement command will:\n1. **Assess your idea**: Perform extensive related work research and create a critical assessment\n2. **Refine the assessment**: Verify claims and focus on substantive concerns\n3. **Present key questions**: Extract the 3 most crucial questions with context and potential approaches\n4. **Update your idea**: Incorporate your responses to improve `idea.md`\n\nOutput is created in `research-os/project/`:\n- `idea.md` - Your refined research idea (updated after each iteration)\n- `assessment.md` - Critical assessment with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations\n- `research-journal.md` - Related work exploration and searches\n\n**Iterate:** Run `/brainstorm` multiple times to progressively refine your research concept. Each iteration deepens the analysis and sharpens the focus.\n\nWhen satisfied with your refined idea, proceed to full research planning with `/plan-research`.\n\n### Phase 1: Research Planning\n\nDevelop your comprehensive research vision with the Researcher plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plan-research\n```\n\nThis comprehensive command will:\n1. Guide you through iterative hypothesis refinement\n2. Research related work and existing solutions\n3. Create a compelling mission statement\n4. Generate an experiment roadmap with phases\n5. Document technical requirements\n\nOutput is created in `research-os/project/`:\n- `research-journal.md` - Iterative refinement history\n- `related-work.md` - Literature review and analysis\n- `mission.md` - Project vision and goals\n- `roadmap.md` - Phased experiment plan\n- `tech-stack.md` - Technical requirements\n\n### Phase 2: Engineering Implementation\n\nUse the Engineer plugin to implement your research vision:\n\n#### 1. Initialize a new artifact\n```bash\n/new-artifact [feature-description]\n```\n- Gathers requirements through targeted questions\n- Processes visual references if provided\n- Creates initial planning documentation\n\n#### 2. Create detailed specifications\n```bash\n/create-artifact\n```\n- Analyzes requirements and context\n- Generates comprehensive `spec.md`\n- Creates strategic `tasks.md` with agent assignments\n\n#### 3. Implement the artifact\n```bash\n/implement-artifact\n```\n- Delegates to specialized implementation agents\n- Executes tasks in parallel where possible\n- Runs verification workflows\n- Produces implementation reports\n\nOutput is organized in `research-os/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-artifact-name/`:\n```\n├── planning/\n│   ├── initialization.md    # Raw idea capture\n│   ├── requirements.md      # Gathered requirements\n│   └── visuals/            # Reference images\n├── spec.md                  # Detailed specification\n├── tasks.md                 # Task breakdown with assignments\n├── implementation/          # Implementation reports per task\n└── verification/           # Verification reports\n```\n\n## Agent Ecosystem\n\n### Researcher Plugin Agents (7)\n- **idea-assessment**: Critical assessment of research ideas with extensive related work analysis\n- **assessment-refiner**: Meta-analysis and refinement of research assessments for maximum utility\n- **gather-research-info**: Iterative research hypothesis development\n- **create-research-mission**: Mission statement and vision crafting\n- **create-experiment-roadmap**: Experiment planning with dependencies\n- **document-tech-stack**: Technical requirements documentation\n\n### Engineer Plugin Agents (12)\n\n#### Specification Agents (5)\n- **spec-initializer**: Project initialization and setup\n- **spec-researcher**: Requirements gathering and analysis\n- **spec-writer**: Detailed specification creation\n- **spec-verifier**: Specification validation\n- **task-list-creator**: Strategic task breakdown\n\n#### Implementation Specialists (5)\n- **api-engineer**: API endpoints, controllers, business logic\n- **database-engineer**: Migrations, models, schemas\n- **ui-designer**: UI components, styling, responsive design\n- **testing-engineer**: Test files, coverage, fixtures\n- **prompt-engineer**: Agentic workflows, orchestration\n\n#### Verification Agents (2)\n- **backend-verifier**: Database and API validation\n- **frontend-verifier**: UI/UX verification\n- **implementation-verifier**: End-to-end verification\n\n## Standards & Customization\n\nResearch-OS uses a sophisticated standards system that can be customized per user or project.\n\n### Default Standards Location\nThe Engineer plugin includes default standards in `plugins/engineer/standards/`:\n- `global/` - Coding style, conventions, error handling\n- `testing/` - Unit tests, coverage requirements\n\n### User Customization\nCreate your own standards in `~/.research-os/standards/`:\n\n```bash\n~/.research-os/standards/\n├── global/\n│   ├── coding-style.md\n│   ├── conventions.md\n│   ├── error-handling.md\n│   └── tech-stack.md\n└── testing/\n    ├── coverage.md\n    └── unit-tests.md\n```\n\n### How Standards Work\n1. **Automatic Copying**: When initializing a new project, standards from `~/.research-os/standards/` are automatically copied as a starting point\n3. **Project-Specific**: Each project can modify its local standards without affecting global defaults\n4. **Inheritance**: Projects start with user standards, falling back to plugin defaults if not customized\n\n## Workflow Examples\n\n### Example: Building a Research Tool\n```bash\n# Phase 0: Brainstorming (Optional but Recommended)\n# Create research-os/project/idea.md with initial concept\n/brainstorm\n# Performs critical assessment with related work analysis\n# Presents 3 key questions with potential approaches\n# Refines research-os/project/idea.md based on your responses\n# (Can iterate multiple times)\n\n# Phase 1: Research Planning\n/plan-research\n# Develops hypothesis for novel visualization approach\n# Researches existing tools and methods\n# Creates roadmap for validation experiments\n\n# Phase 2: Implementation\n/new-artifact interactive-visualization-dashboard\n# Gathers specific requirements\n# Processes mockups and wireframes\n\n/create-artifact\n# Generates detailed specs\n# Creates task breakdown\n\n/implement-artifact\n# Implements with specialized agents\n# Verifies functionality\n```\n\n## Architecture Benefits\n\n### Separation of Concerns\n- **Research Phase**: Focus on \"what\" and \"why\"\n- **Engineering Phase**: Focus on \"how\" and implementation details\n- **Clear handoff points** between phases via documented artifacts\n\n### Context Engineering\n- **Templates**: Reusable workflows and patterns\n- **Standards**: Consistent coding practices across projects\n- **File Artifacts**: Explicit context passing between agents\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive records at every step\n\n### Quality Assurance\n- **Spec-Driven**: Implementation follows detailed specifications\n- **Test-Driven**: Testing requirements defined upfront\n- **Verification**: Automated checks at multiple levels\n- **Code Quality**: Automatic linting and formatting (ruff)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Hooks System\nBoth plugins support Claude Code hooks for automation:\n- **File creation hooks**: Trigger on new file creation\n- **Code checking hooks**: Run ruff on Python files\n- **Custom workflows**: Extensible hook system\n\n### Parallel Execution\n- Independent tasks run concurrently\n- Intelligent scheduling based on dependencies\n- Optimized for multi-agent workflows\n\n### Visual Asset Processing\n- Support for mockups and wireframes\n- Image analysis for UI requirements\n- Reference storage in planning directories\n\n## Contributing\n\nResearch-OS is designed to be extended. You can:\n\n### Add New Agents\n1. Create agent definition in appropriate plugin's `agents/` directory\n2. Follow YAML frontmatter pattern\n3. Define clear specialization areas\n4. Update plugin.json if needed\n\n### Add New Commands\n1. Create command in plugin's `commands/` directory\n2. Define phase-based workflow\n3. Delegate to appropriate agents\n4. Maintain separation between research and engineering\n\n### Extend Standards\n1. Add new standard categories in `~/.research-os/standards/`\n2. Agents will automatically reference them\n3. Share standard sets with your team\n\n## Philosophy\n\nResearch-OS embodies several key principles:\n\n1. **Research Before Implementation**: Think deeply before coding\n2. **Specification as Contract**: Clear specs prevent scope creep\n3. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent excels in its domain\n4. **Documentation as First-Class**: Every decision is documented\n5. **Standards Enable Scale**: Consistency across projects\n6. **Verification Builds Trust**: Automated checks ensure quality\n\n## Support\n\n- **Documentation**: Built-in CLAUDE.md provides detailed guidance\n- **Issues**: Report bugs at [github.com/wielandbrendel/research-os/issues](https://github.com/wielandbrendel/research-os/issues)\n- **Claude Code Help**: Use `/help` in Claude Code interface\n- **Plugin Documentation**: See [Claude Code plugin docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)\n\n## License\n\n[Add appropriate license information]\n\n---\n\nBuilt with ❤️ for the Claude Code ecosystem."
