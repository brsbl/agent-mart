        "personal-assistant/README.md": "# Personal Assistant (Elle)\n\nMeet **Elle** — your AI personal assistant who actually remembers you.\n\nElle transforms Claude Code from a stateless AI into a personal assistant with persistent memory. She learns your preferences, tracks your projects, remembers key people in your life, and gets better at helping you over time.\n\n## What Makes Elle Different\n\n| Without Elle | With Elle |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| \"Here's how to prioritize tasks...\" | \"Given your energy patterns and the important client meetings this week, I'd suggest front-loading the Acme deliverable on Monday when you're freshest.\" |\n| Starts from zero every conversation | Remembers your context across sessions |\n| Generic responses | Personalized to your preferences and workflows |\n| Reactive to your requests | Proactive about deadlines, reminders, and opportunities |\n| Makes the same mistakes | Learns from corrections and never repeats them |\n\n## How Elle Works\n\nElle maintains a **context system** — a collection of files that persist across conversations. Every time you chat, Elle:\n\n1. **Loads your context** — Who you are, how you work, what you're working on\n2. **Grounds responses in your context** — Personalizes everything to your situation\n3. **Updates her memory** — Captures new information, preferences, and corrections\n\nThe result: Elle becomes more helpful the more you use her.\n\n## Requirements\n\n**[NOTE]** You must already have uv installed and the AI Launchpad marketplace added, see [main README](../README.md) if you haven't already.\n\nNo additional requirements.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Start Claude Code anywhere.\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\n2. Install the plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin install personal-assistant@ai-launchpad\n```\n\nYou can also do this interactively by running `/plugin`.\n\n3. Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.\n\n4. **Set up Elle** (first time only):\n\n```bash\n/personal-assistant:setup\n```\n\nThis sets the output style, initializes the context system at `~/.claude/.context/`, and optionally walks you through onboarding to populate your context.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/personal-assistant:setup` | First-time setup. Sets output style and initializes context system. |\n| `/personal-assistant:onboard` | Guided conversation to populate your context. Run anytime to update. |\n| `/personal-assistant:upgrade` | Upgrade context system to latest structure (preserves all your data). |\n| `/personal-assistant:update-context` | Manually trigger context update based on current conversation. |\n\n## Context System\n\nElle's memory is stored at `~/.claude/.context/` — **external to the plugin** so your data persists across plugin updates and reinstalls.\n\n### Structure\n\n```\n~/.claude/.context/\n├── CLAUDE.md              # Elle's operating instructions\n├── context-update.md      # How Elle updates her memory\n└── core/                  # All your context lives here\n    ├── identity.md        # Who you are (personal, professional, goals)\n    ├── preferences.md     # How you like to work and communicate\n    ├── workflows.md       # Your standard procedures\n    ├── relationships.md   # Key people in your life\n    ├── triggers.md        # Important dates, deadlines, reminders\n    ├── projects.md        # All your projects (work + life)\n    ├── rules.md           # Hard rules from corrections\n    ├── session.md         # Current working session (ephemeral)\n    └── journal.md         # Log of notable sessions\n```\n\n### Context Files Explained\n\n| File | Purpose | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| `identity.md` | Who you are | Family, career, goals, challenges |\n| `preferences.md` | How you work | Communication style, tools, decision-making |\n| `workflows.md` | Standard procedures | Daily routines, file organization, processes |\n| `relationships.md` | Key people | Family, colleagues, collaborators |\n| `triggers.md` | Time-sensitive items | Deadlines, birthdays, recurring check-ins |\n| `projects.md` | What you're working on | Active projects with locations and status |\n| `rules.md` | Hard rules | Things Elle must NEVER or ALWAYS do |\n| `session.md` | Current focus | What you're working on right now |\n| `journal.md` | History | Log of notable sessions for pattern recognition |\n\n### Rules System\n\nThe `rules.md` file is special — Elle **always checks it before taking any action**. When she makes a mistake and you correct her, she adds a rule so she never makes that mistake again.\n\nExample rules:\n```\n- NEVER commit directly to main without asking\n- ALWAYS use pnpm instead of npm in this project\n- NEVER suggest medication changes without consulting the health profile\n```\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\npersonal-assistant/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json                # Plugin metadata\n├── README.md                      # This file\n├── commands/\n│   ├── setup.md                   # First-time setup\n│   ├── onboard.md                 # Guided context population\n│   ├── upgrade.md                 # Upgrade context structure\n│   └── update-context.md          # Manual context update\n├── context-template/              # Templates (copied to ~/.claude/.context/)\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── context-update.md\n│   └── core/\n│       ├── identity.md\n│       ├── preferences.md\n│       ├── workflows.md\n│       ├── relationships.md\n│       ├── triggers.md\n│       ├── projects.md\n│       ├── rules.md\n│       ├── session.md\n│       └── journal.md\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── hooks.json                 # Hooks configuration\n│   ├── load_context_system.py     # Loads context on every message\n│   ├── update_context_on_stop.py  # Prompts context update after tasks\n│   └── play_notification.py       # Notification sounds\n├── output-styles/\n│   └── personal-assistant.md      # Elle's personality and behavior\n└── skills/\n    └── skill-creator/             # Skill for creating new skills\n```\n\n## Hooks\n\nElle uses hooks to automatically manage context:\n\n| Hook | Trigger | Description |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| `load_context_system.py` | On every message | Loads your context from `~/.claude/.context/` |\n| `update_context_on_stop.py` | After Elle responds | Prompts Elle to update context with new learnings |\n| `play_notification.py` | On stop, permissions, idle | Plays notification sounds |\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you've been using an older version of the Personal Assistant, run:\n\n```bash\n/personal-assistant:upgrade\n```\n\nThis safely migrates your context to the latest structure while **preserving all your data**. A backup is created automatically.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nElle is built on the principle that **context is everything**. A personal assistant who doesn't remember isn't personal at all.\n\nThe more Elle knows about you:\n- The better she can anticipate your needs\n- The more relevant her suggestions become\n- The fewer times you have to repeat yourself\n- The more valuable she becomes over time\n\nYour context is **your data** — stored externally, never sent to training, always under your control.\n",

        "writing/README.md": "# writing/\n\nA Claude Code plugin for writing content in Kenny Liao's authentic voice across all content types and platforms.\n\n## Skills\n\n### voice (Personality Skill)\n\nDefines and applies Kenny's authentic writing voice. This is a **personality skill** — it doesn't produce content on its own. Instead, task skills invoke it to transform their output into Kenny's voice.\n\nKey characteristics it enforces:\n- Parenthetical asides as a signature pattern\n- Short punches alternating with longer explanations\n- Deliberate sentence fragments\n- Personal experience as default evidence\n- Counterpoint acknowledgment with specific transition phrases\n- Raw, thinking-out-loud quality over polished prose\n\n### copywriting (Task Skill)\n\nGeneralized writing skill that produces written content for any platform and format. Handles newsletters, YouTube scripts, guides, sales copy, Twitter/X posts, LinkedIn posts, and Substack Notes.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Determines content type from user request\n2. Loads platform-specific reference (e.g., `newsletter.md`, `youtube-script.md`)\n3. Drafts content following platform structure\n4. Invokes `writing:voice` to apply Kenny's voice\n5. Invokes `branding-kit:brand-guidelines` for brand compliance\n6. Presents to user for feedback\n\n## Skill Composition\n\nThese two skills are designed to work together. The **copywriting** skill handles *what* to write and *how to structure it* for each platform. The **voice** skill handles *how it should sound*. This separation means:\n\n- Voice rules stay consistent regardless of content type\n- Platform structure rules stay clean without voice concerns mixed in\n- Other plugins can invoke `writing:voice` independently for their own text output\n\n## References\n\n- `skills/voice/references/voice-profile.md` — Full voice analysis with extended examples\n- `skills/copywriting/references/` — Platform-specific structure guides (newsletter, YouTube script, guide, sales page, Twitter, LinkedIn, Substack Notes)\n",
