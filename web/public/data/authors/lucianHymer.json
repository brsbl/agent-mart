        "README.md": "# Mím - Persistent Memory for Claude Code\n\n![Mim Demo](assets/demo.gif)\n\n## Description\n\nMim is an AI-powered knowledge management system for Claude Code with three core components:\n\n- **Knowledge Capture**: The MCP `remember()` tool allows Claude Code to automatically capture insights and discoveries during sessions\n- **Knowledge Review**: An interactive TUI game for reviewing, organizing, and refining captured knowledge\n- **AI-Powered Processing**: Uses the Claude Agent SDK for intelligent knowledge categorization and conflict resolution\n\nKnowledge is organized into categories:\n- **Architecture** - System design decisions and structural patterns\n- **Patterns** - Recurring code patterns and best practices\n- **Dependencies** - Package relationships and version constraints\n- **Workflows** - Development processes and automation\n- **Gotchas** - Edge cases, pitfalls, and lessons learned\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 18+\n\n## Installation\n\nOnce per machine:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g mim-ai\nclaude plugin marketplace add lucianHymer/mim\n```\n\nand once per repo:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install mim-ai@mim-marketplace --scope project\n```\n\nThat's it. Mím will guide you through the rest.\n\n## How It Works\n\nOnce installed, everything happens in the background:\n\n1. **Automatic capture**: As you work, Claude uses `remember()` to capture discoveries about your codebase\n2. **Background processing**: New knowledge is deduplicated, categorized, and written to organized files\n3. **Background validation**: On session start, existing knowledge is checked against your current codebase\n4. **Review when needed**: When conflicts or decisions arise, you'll be prompted to run `mim review`\n\nThe knowledge is loaded into Claude's memory through your project's `CLAUDE.md` file. Use `/memory` or `/context` in Claude Code to verify it's working.\n\n### Commands\n\n- `mim` or `mim status` - Check for pending reviews (plugin runs this automatically)\n- `mim review` - Launch the interactive review TUI (plugin prompts you to run this when needed)\n- `mim init` - Initialize the `.claude/knowledge/` directory (plugin runs this automatically on first `claude` run in a repo)\n\n### Note on Resume Sessions\n\nBackground validation runs via the Claude Agent SDK, which creates entries in your resume session list. This is an unavoidable side effect of the current SDK architecture.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Music: [DOOM](https://opengameart.org/content/triple-kill-multiple-tracks)\n- Tileset: [16x16 Fantasy Tileset](https://opengameart.org/content/16x16-fantasy-tileset)\n- Sound Effects: [512 Sound Effects (8-bit style)](https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style)\n- Built on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n\n## License\n\n[FSL-1.1-MIT](LICENSE) — Free to use, modify, and share.

Odin\nclaimed it back. Now preserved in herbs and rune-magic, the severed head\nwhispers secrets from the cosmic deep - deathless, sleepless, all-remembering.\n\nMim captures what Claude Code discovers in its wanderings, preserving each\ninsight in an ever-growing Wellspring of Knowledge.\nNothing learned is lost.\nEvery discovery feeds the depths.\n\nWhat dies in context lives eternal in the Wellspring.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <i>\n        A knowledge accumulation system for Claude Code that\n        never forgets what it learns.\n    </i>\n    <br><br>\n    <img\n        src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucianHymer/mim/refs/heads/main/assets/mim.jpg\"\n        width=\"320px\"\n        alt=\"Odin and Mimir's Head\"\n        title=\"Odin and Mimir's Head, 2006 Sam Flegal, https://www.germanicmythology.com/works/TMMimirsHead.html\"\n    >\n    <br>\n    <b>Odin with Mímir's Head</b>\n</p>\n"
