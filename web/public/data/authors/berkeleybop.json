There are favored\ntools such as Claude Code for the terminal and Claude Code on the web\nfor non-terminal use, but no mandate to use these.\n\nThe existence of these tools does mean that expectations of things\nlike basic repo hygiene and best practices as laid out in\n[github-repo-skill/](github-repo-skill/) are now much higher, given it\nis very easy for coding tools to do a good job on this, even with legacy repos.\n\n\nWhile we generally want to be forward in using AI, we should be cogniscent of context, see for example:\n\n* [respect users who create issues](https://ai4curation.io/aidocs/how-tos/instruct-github-agent/#be-respectful-of-the-user-who-created-the-issue)\n\n## Historic notes\n\nWe used to maintain a github repo here with best practice:\n\nhttps://berkeleybop.org/best_practice/\n\nA lot of this has become stale, and many parts of this will gradually\nbe migrated to skills, either in this repo, or in a repo such as [the ai4curation skills repo](https://github.com/ai4curation/curation-skills)\n\n## LICENSE and use of these skills\n\nThe [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) is CC-0.
