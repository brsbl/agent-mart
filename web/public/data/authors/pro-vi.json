        "cc-iching/README.md": "# cc-iching 易經\n\n> **Note**: Plugin hook output may not reach Claude ([#12151](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12151)) — untested whether this is resolved. Manual installation works reliably. Also note: as of the latest version, hook output (exit code 0) no longer shows to the user, no idea why they did this. Claude still sees it as a system reminder and will weave it into conversation. To get the most out of it, dedicate a session to interacting with the reading: ask Claude about your hexagram, explore the derived hexagrams, or just see what connections it draws to your current work.\n\nA Claude Code hook for daily I Ching divination using authentic 3-coin casting with true entropy.\n\n## Foreword\n\nI Ching is the oldest binary system in existence, encoding wisdom through broken and unbroken lines (yin and yang) representing 0 and 1 millennia before Leibniz formalized binary mathematics in the 17th century, demonstrating that binary logic has been fundamental to human understanding for over three thousand years.\n\nI built this simple hook as an attempt to demonstrate the I Ching's binary nature in modern code, while embedding this ancient wisdom into a contemporary medium. This aims to help anyone interested in dipping their toes into divination or exploring the philosophical roots of computing without breaking their flow in Claude Code.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Authentic casting**: Uses `crypto.randomBytes()` for OS-level entropy (hardware noise, interrupt timing)\n- **Daily hexagram**: One cast per day, cached locally, with a historic log of past readings\n- **6 commentary styles**: 大象傳, 彖傳, each with English translations, Wilhelm-inspired interpretation (experimental), and trigram structure breakdown\n- **5 derived hexagrams**: 互卦 (nuclear), 錯卦 (polarity), 綜卦 (mirror), 之卦 (becoming), 對角卦 (diagonal)\n- **Progressive reveal**: ~36.5% chance to show commentary or derived hexagrams on subsequent prompts\n- **Non-spammy**: ~63.5% of prompts are silent after the first reading\n- **Culturally grounded**: Traditional casting method with scholarly translations\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via Plugin Marketplace\n\nRequires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime (`brew install bun`).\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add pro-vi/cc-iching\n/plugin install cc-iching\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. **Prerequisite**: Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install bun\n   ```\n\n2. **Copy hook file**:\n\n   ```bash\n   cp hooks/iching.ts ~/.claude/hooks/iching.ts\n   ```\n\n3. **Add to settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"hooks\": {\n       \"UserPromptSubmit\": [\n         {\n           \"type\": \"command\",\n           \"command\": \"bun ~/.claude/hooks/iching.ts\",\n           \"timeout\": 5000\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Test**:\n   ```bash\n   echo '{}' | bun ~/.claude/hooks/iching.ts\n   ```\n\n### Hook Details\n\nUses the `UserPromptSubmit` hook (exit 0). Output goes to Claude as a system reminder — **you won't see it in the terminal**. Claude sees the reading and may reference it, draw connections to your work, or mention it unprompted. To explore a reading, ask Claude about it directly — it already has the full hexagram data in context.\n\n## Output Example\n\n**First prompt of day (primary reading):**\n\n```\n䷶ 豐 (Fēng) — Thunder and lightning arrive together; the noble one decides cases and applies consequences → ䷣ 明夷 [4]\n```\n\n**Sample subsequent prompts (32.5% chance):**\n\n```\n互卦 (hidden within) ䷼ 中孚 (Zhōng Fú) — Wind above the lake; the noble one deliberates on cases and delays executions\n錯卦 (polarity) ䷺ 渙 (Huàn) — Wind moves over water; the ancient kings made offerings and established temples\n綜卦 (mirror) ䷷ 旅 (Lǚ) — Fire upon the mountain; the noble one applies consequences wisely, resolves matters swiftly\n綜卦 (自綜) ䷀ 乾 (Qián) — Heaven moves with vigor; the noble one strives ceaselessly\n之卦 (becoming) ䷣ 明夷 (Míng Yí) — Brightness enters the earth; the noble one governs by concealing brilliance within\n對角卦 (diagonal) ䷋ 否 (Pǐ) — Heaven and earth do not unite; the noble one withdraws into frugal virtue\n```\n\n## Progressive Reveal\n\n**First prompt each day:** Full reading with 大象傳 (Image commentary)\n\n**Subsequent prompts:** ~36.5% chance of showing one of the following:\n\n| Type           | Description                            | Chance |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| 大象傳 (dx)    | Image commentary (Chinese)             | 4%     |\n| 彖傳 (tu)      | Judgment commentary (Chinese)          | 4%     |\n| 大象傳 (en)    | Image commentary (English)             | 4%     |\n| 彖傳 (te)      | Judgment commentary (English)          | 4%     |\n| Wilhelm (w)    | Wilhelm/Jung inspired interpretation   | 4%     |\n| Structure (st) | Trigram breakdown (upper/lower)        | 4%     |\n| 互卦           | Nuclear hexagram (hidden within)       | 2.5%   |\n| 錯卦           | Polarity hexagram (all lines inverted) | 2.5%   |\n| 綜卦           | Mirror hexagram (reversed view)        | 2.5%   |\n| 之卦           | Becoming hexagram (transformation)     | 2.5%   |\n| 對角卦         | Diagonal hexagram (錯+綜 combined)     | 2.5%   |\n\n63.5% of prompts remain silent after the initial reading.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Casting Method (擲錢法)\n\n- 3 coins × 6 lines\n- Each coin: heads = 3, tails = 2\n- Line values:\n  - 6 (old yin, 1/8) — changing to yang\n  - 7 (young yang, 3/8) — stable\n  - 8 (young yin, 3/8) — stable\n  - 9 (old yang, 1/8) — changing to yin\n\n### Cryptographic Randomness\n\nThis hook uses `crypto.randomBytes()` instead of `Math.random()`. The difference matters.\n\n**`Math.random()`** is a fast PRNG (pseudo-random number generator). Implementation-defined, not designed to resist prediction. Fine for games, not for anything where unpredictability matters.\n\n**`crypto.randomBytes()`** is a CSPRNG (cryptographically secure PRNG) seeded by OS-provided entropy. Still deterministic under the hood, but the internal state is computationally infeasible to predict.\n\nWhen you cast coins or yarrow stalks, the outcome emerges from your table's surface, air currents, the tremor in your hand, making the randomness inseparable from your present moment and bodily state, which is why traditional casting feels personally meaningful.\n\nThe CSPRNG's entropy pool works analogously. It draws from your machine: the hardware itself, timing variations in your system, the accumulated state, randomness emerging from the physical context you're already part of, only abstracted through layers of silicon and mathematics.\n\nYou get one cast per day.\n\n### Storage & Cache\n\n- **Daily cache**: `~/.claude/iching.json` — today's reading (delete to force new cast)\n- **History**: `~/.claude/iching.jsonl` — append-only log of past readings (update on new cast)\n- **Timezone**: Local system time determines when midnight resets the daily cast\n\n## How I Use It\n\nWhen a reading pops up that piques my interest, I open a new Claude Code session to investigate deeper. If I'm working in a project, Claude already has visibility into the process, so the reading becomes immediately applicable rather than abstract. Multiple angles are built in to achieve a balanced and nuanced perspective:\n\n- **Primary hexagram** — the situation as it appears\n- **Changing lines** — where the energy is active\n- **互卦 (hidden within)** — what's gestating inside\n- **錯卦 (polarity)** — the complementary opposite\n- **綜卦 (mirror)** — how others might see it\n- **之卦 (becoming)** — where it's heading\n- **對角卦 (diagonal)** — the furthest point, 錯+綜 combined\n\nI particularly appreciated how the complete array of derived hexagrams, when viewed together, synthesized, illuminated both outer conditions and inner experience with remarkable intensity and nuance.\n\nThe hook is non-spammy by design as most prompts are silent. When a reading appears, I see it as an invitation to reflect and dive deeper into the practice. Of course, you may ask Claude to update the mechanism or adjust the frequency to suit your needs.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] **自綜 self-mirroring detection** — 8 hexagrams are vertically symmetric and therefore self-mirroring. Identify and label accordingly.\n- [x] **错综同象 locked pairs** — 4 hexagram pairs where 綜卦 = 錯卦 (泰/否, 隨/蠱, 漸/歸妹, 既濟/未濟). Detected and labeled.\n- [x] **對角卦 diagonal hexagram** — 錯+綜 combined, the furthest point in the transformation square. Special cases for self-mirroring (diagonal = polarity) and locked pairs (diagonal = self, 自返).\n- [ ] **相綜 pair descriptions** — The 28 hexagram pairs represent opposite perspectives on the same situation. Understanding the pairing adds depth to mirror hexagram readings.\n- [ ] **互卦 trigram breakdown** — Show the inner/outer trigrams that form the nuclear hexagram. The inner trigram reflects the internal landscape, the outer shows the external situation.\n- [ ] **爻辭 line texts** — Specific counsel for each changing line. When lines transform, these texts address exactly where and how the energy is moving.\n- [ ] **Wilhelm/Baynes commentary integration** — Update the classic I Ching interpretations alongside readings, with proper attribution to the 1950 Bollingen Series translation.\n- [ ] **Commentary refinement** — Classical translations shall evolve as I explore each hexagram more deeply through practice.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
