Source conda: `source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`\n2. Check if the environment exists: `conda env list | grep -w [env_name]`\n3. If it exists, activate it: `conda activate [env_name]`\n4. If it doesn't exist:\n   - Use AskUserQuestion to ask:\n     - Confirm the environment name (or let them change it)\n     - Python version to use (options: 3.11, 3.12, 3.10, or custom)\n   - If Python version is not specified or user selects default, use Python 3.11 (stable)\n   - Create environment: `conda create -n [env_name] python=[version] -y`\n   - Activate it after creation\n\nIf NO environment name is provided:\n1. Source conda: `source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`\n2. List all available environments: `conda env list`\n3. Use AskUserQuestion tool to ask which environment to use (include \"Create new environment\" as an option)\n4. If user selects \"Create new environment\":\n   - Ask for environment name\n   - Ask for Python version (default to 3.11 if not specified)\n   - Create and activate the environment\n5. Otherwise, activate the selected environment\n\n## Step 3: Run the Python code\n- After activating the environment, run the Python command/script requested by the user\n- Use the format: `source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate [env_name] && python [script_or_code]`\n\n## Notes\n- Always source conda initialization before running conda commands\n- Default Python version is 3.11 (stable) when not specified\n- Keep the environment activated for the entire bash session if running multiple commands\n- If user requests to install packages, use: `conda activate [env_name] && pip install [package]` or `conda install [package]`\n",
