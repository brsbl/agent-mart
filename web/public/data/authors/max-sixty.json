It's built with love (there's no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), & [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I'm intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.\n\nWorktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.\n\nWorktrunk's three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.\n\nScaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:\n\n![Worktrunk Demo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/max-sixty/worktrunk-assets@main/assets/docs/light/wt-core.gif)\n\n> ### 📚 Full documentation at [worktrunk.dev](https://worktrunk.dev) 📚\n\n<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#context-git-worktrees..worktrunk-makes-git-worktrees-as-easy-as-branches — edit source to update -->\n\n## Context: git worktrees\n\nAI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without\nsupervision, such that it's possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git's native\nworktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don't step\non each other's changes.\n\nBut the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new\nworktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat\n../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.\n\n## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches\n\nWorktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.\n\n> Start with the core commands\n\n**Core commands:**\n\n<table class=\"cmd-compare\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Task</th>\n      <th>Worktrunk</th>\n      <th>Plain git</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Switch worktrees</td>\n      <td><pre>wt switch feat</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>cd ../repo.feat</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Create + start Claude</td>\n      <td><pre>wt switch -c -x claude feat</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat && \\\ncd ../repo.feat && \\\nclaude</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Clean up</td>\n      <td><pre>wt remove</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>cd ../repo && \\\ngit worktree remove ../repo.feat && \\\ngit branch -d feat</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>List with status</td>\n      <td><pre>wt list</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>git worktree list</pre> (paths only)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n**Workflow automation:**\n\n> Expand into the more advanced commands as needed\n\n- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc\n- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs\n- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command\n- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**\n\nA demo with some advanced features:\n\n![Worktrunk omnibus demo: multiple Claude agents in Zellij tabs with hooks, LLM commits, and merge workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max-sixty/worktrunk-assets/main/assets/docs/light/wt-zellij-omnibus.gif)\n\n<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->\n\n<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#install..further-reading — edit source to update -->\n\n## Install\n\n**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**\n\n```bash\nbrew install worktrunk && wt config shell install\n```\n\nShell integration allows commands to change directories.\n\n**Cargo:**\n\n```bash\ncargo install worktrunk && wt config shell install\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\nOn Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal's command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:\n\n```bash\nwinget install max-sixty.worktrunk\ngit-wt config shell install\n```\n\nAlternatively, disable Windows Terminal's alias (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable \"Windows Terminal\") to use `wt` directly.\n\n</details>\n\n**Arch Linux:**\n\n```bash\nparu worktrunk-bin && wt config shell install\n```\n\n## Quick start\n\nCreate a worktree for a new feature:\n\n```console\n$ wt switch --create feature-auth\n✓ Created branch feature-auth from main and worktree @ repo.feature-auth\n\n```\n\nThis creates a new branch and worktree, then switches to it. Do your work, then check all worktrees with [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/):\n\n```console\n$ wt list\n  Branch        Status        HEAD±    main↕  Remote⇅  Commit    Age   Message\n@ feature-auth  +   –      +53                         0e631add  1d    Initial commit\n^ main              ^⇡                         ⇡1      0e631add  1d    Initial commit\n\n○ Showing 2 worktrees, 1 with changes, 1 column hidden\n\n```\n\nThe `@` marks the current worktree. `+` means uncommitted changes, `↕` means unpushed commits.\n\nWhen done, either:\n\n**PR workflow** — commit, push, open a PR, merge via GitHub/GitLab, then clean up:\n\n```bash\nwt step commit                    # commit staged changes\ngh pr create                      # or glab mr create\nwt remove                         # after PR is merged\n```\n\n**Local merge** — squash, rebase onto main, fast-forward merge, clean up:\n\n```console\n$ wt merge main\n◎ Generating commit message and committing changes... (2 files, +53, no squashing needed)\n  Add authentication module\n✓ Committed changes @ a1b2c3d\n◎ Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no rebase needed)\n  * a1b2c3d Add authentication module\n   auth.rs | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n   lib.rs  |  2 ++\n   2 files changed, 53 insertions(+)\n✓ Merged to main (1 commit, 2 files, +53)\n◎ Removing feature-auth worktree & branch in background (same commit as main, _)\n○ Switched to worktree for main @ repo\n\n```\n\nFor parallel agents, create multiple worktrees and launch an agent in each:\n\n```bash\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-a -- 'Add user authentication'\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-b -- 'Fix the pagination bug'\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-c -- 'Write tests for the API'\n```\n\nThe `-x` flag runs a command after switching; arguments after `--` are passed to it.

When a prompt is submitted, the hook sets 🤖 on that branch. When Claude finishes and waits for input, it switches to 💬. When the session ends, the marker clears.\n\nThese markers appear in `wt list` output, making it easy to see which worktrees have active Claude sessions — useful when running multiple instances in parallel.\n\n**Set up LLM commit message generation**\n\nThe configuration skill guides through configuring an AI tool (Claude Code, Codex, llm, or aichat) and adding `[commit.generation]` to the user config so `wt merge` can auto-generate commit messages.\n\n**Add post-create hooks to run npm install automatically**\n\nThe skill configures `.config/wt.toml` with project hooks. Post-create hooks run when creating worktrees, pre-merge hooks validate before merging.\n"
