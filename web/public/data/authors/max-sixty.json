It's built with love (there's no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), & [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg). Please let me know any frictions at all; I'm intensely focused on making Worktrunk excellent, and the biggest gap is understanding how others experience using it.\n\nWorktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.\n\nWorktrunk's three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.\n\nScaling agents becomes trivial. A quick demo:\n\n![Worktrunk Demo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/max-sixty/worktrunk-assets@main/assets/docs/light/wt-core.gif)\n\n> ### 📚 Full documentation at [worktrunk.dev](https://worktrunk.dev) 📚\n\n<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#context-git-worktrees..worktrunk-makes-git-worktrees-as-easy-as-branches — edit source to update -->\n\n## Context: git worktrees\n\nAI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without\nsupervision, such that it's possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git's native\nworktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don't step\non each other's changes.\n\nBut the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new\nworktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat\n../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.\n\n## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches\n\nWorktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template.\n\n> Start with the core commands\n\n**Core commands:**\n\n<table class=\"cmd-compare\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Task</th>\n      <th>Worktrunk</th>\n      <th>Plain git</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Switch worktrees</td>\n      <td><pre>wt switch feat</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>cd ../repo.feat</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Create + start Claude</td>\n      <td><pre>wt switch -c -x claude feat</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat && \\\ncd ../repo.feat && \\\nclaude</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Clean up</td>\n      <td><pre>wt remove</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>cd ../repo && \\\ngit worktree remove ../repo.feat && \\\ngit branch -d feat</pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>List with status</td>\n      <td><pre>wt list</pre></td>\n      <td><pre>git worktree list</pre> (paths only)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n> Expand into the more advanced commands as needed\n\n**Workflow automation:**\n\n- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc\n- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs\n- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command\n- **[Interactive picker](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/#interactive-picker)** — browse worktrees with live diff and log previews\n- **[Copy build caches](https://worktrunk.dev/step/)** — skip cold starts by sharing `target/`, `node_modules/`, etc between worktrees\n- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**\n\nA demo with some advanced features:\n\n![Worktrunk omnibus demo: multiple Claude agents in Zellij tabs with hooks, LLM commits, and merge workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max-sixty/worktrunk-assets/main/assets/docs/light/wt-zellij-omnibus.gif)\n\n<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->\n\n<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from docs/content/worktrunk.md#install..further-reading — edit source to update -->\n\n## Install\n\n**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**\n\n```bash\nbrew install worktrunk && wt config shell install\n```\n\nShell integration allows commands to change directories.\n\n**Cargo:**\n\n```bash\ncargo install worktrunk && wt config shell install\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\nOn Windows, `wt` defaults to Windows Terminal's command. Winget additionally installs Worktrunk as `git-wt` to avoid the conflict:\n\n```bash\nwinget install max-sixty.worktrunk\ngit-wt config shell install\n```\n\nAlternatively, disable Windows Terminal's alias (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers → App Execution Aliases → disable \"Windows Terminal\") to use `wt` directly.\n\n</details>\n\n**Arch Linux:**\n\n```bash\nparu worktrunk-bin && wt config shell install\n```\n\n## Quick start\n\nCreate a worktree for a new feature:\n\n```console\n$ wt switch --create feature-auth\n✓ Created branch feature-auth from main and worktree @ repo.feature-auth\n\n```\n\nThis creates a new branch and worktree, then switches to it. Do your work, then check all worktrees with [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/):\n\n```console\n$ wt list\n  Branch        Status        HEAD±    main↕  Remote⇅  Commit    Age   Message\n@ feature-auth  +   –      +53                         0e631add  1d    Initial commit\n^ main              ^⇡                         ⇡1      0e631add  1d    Initial commit\n\n○ Showing 2 worktrees, 1 with changes, 1 column hidden\n\n```\n\nThe `@` marks the current worktree. `+` means staged changes, `⇡` means unpushed commits.\n\nWhen done, either:\n\n**PR workflow** — commit, push, open a PR, merge via GitHub/GitLab, then clean up:\n\n```bash\nwt step commit                    # commit staged changes\ngh pr create                      # or glab mr create\nwt remove                         # after PR is merged\n```\n\n**Local merge** — squash, rebase onto main, fast-forward merge, clean up:\n\n```console\n$ wt merge main\n◎ Generating commit message and committing changes... (2 files, +53, no squashing needed)\n  Add authentication module\n✓ Committed changes @ a1b2c3d\n◎ Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no rebase needed)\n  * a1b2c3d Add authentication module\n   auth.rs | 51 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n   lib.rs  |  2 ++\n   2 files changed, 53 insertions(+)\n✓ Merged to main (1 commit, 2 files, +53)\n◎ Removing feature-auth worktree & branch in background (same commit as main, _)\n○ Switched to worktree for main @ repo\n\n```\n\nFor parallel agents, create multiple worktrees and launch an agent in each:\n\n```bash\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-a -- 'Add user authentication'\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-b -- 'Fix the pagination bug'\nwt switch -x claude -c feature-c -- 'Write tests for the API'\n```\n\nThe `-x` flag runs a command after switching; arguments after `--` are passed to it.

Install it first:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### uv (Python package manager)\n\nThis plugin requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python\ndependencies (requires Python 3.11+, which uv will install automatically if\nneeded):\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom your terminal, run:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/jean-claude\nclaude plugin install jean-claude@jean-claude\n```\n\n## Setup\n\n### Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)\n\nAfter installing the plugin, ask Claude to authenticate:\n\n```\n\"Set up Google authentication for jean-claude\"\n```\n\nClaude will run the auth command for you, which opens a browser for OAuth\nconsent.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong> (if you prefer running commands yourself)</summary>\n\n```bash\n# The plugin is installed at:\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/jean-claude\n\n# Full access (read, send, modify)\nuv run jean-claude auth\n\n# Or read-only access (no send/modify capabilities)\nuv run jean-claude auth --readonly\n\n# Verify it worked\nuv run jean-claude status\n```\n\nCredentials are saved to `~/.config/jean-claude/token.json` and persist until\nrevoked.\n\n</details>\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You may see an \"unverified app\" warning during OAuth—this is normal for apps\n> pending Google verification. Click \"Advanced\" → \"Go to jean-claude (unsafe)\"\n> to proceed. The app only requests the permissions you approve and stores\n> credentials locally on your machine.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Using your own Google Cloud credentials</strong> (optional)</summary>\n\nUse your own credentials if the default ones stop working (Google limits\nunverified apps to 100 users) or if you want your own quota.\n\n1. Create a Google Cloud project at https://console.cloud.google.com\n2. Go to \"APIs & Services\" → \"Enabled APIs\" and enable:\n   - Gmail API\n   - Google Calendar API\n   - Google Drive API\n3. Go to \"APIs & Services\" → \"OAuth consent screen\":\n   - Choose \"External\" user type\n   - Fill in app name and your email\n   - Add scopes: `gmail.modify`, `calendar`, `drive`\n   - Add yourself as a test user\n4. Go to \"APIs & Services\" → \"Credentials\":\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Choose \"Desktop app\" as application type\n   - Download the JSON file\n5. Move the downloaded file:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.config/jean-claude\n   mv ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json ~/.config/jean-claude/client_secret.json\n   ```\n6. Run the auth command—it will automatically use your credentials\n\n</details>\n\n### iMessage (macOS only)\n\niMessage integration requires macOS—it uses AppleScript and the local Messages\ndatabase.\n\n- **Sending messages**: Works via AppleScript. On first use, macOS prompts to\n  allow your terminal to control Messages.app (Automation permission). Grant\n  this to whichever app runs Claude Code (Terminal, iTerm2, VS Code, etc.).\n\n- **Reading messages**: Requires Full Disk Access to read the Messages database.\n  1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Full Disk Access**\n  2. Click **+** and add the app that runs Claude Code:\n     - If using Terminal: add `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`\n     - If using iTerm2: add `/Applications/iTerm.app`\n     - If using VS Code: add `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app`\n     - If using another terminal: find it in `/Applications` or via `which`\n  3. Toggle the app **on** and restart it\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, Claude automatically uses this plugin when you ask it to:\n\n- Search, send, or draft emails\n- Check calendar or create events\n- Find, upload, or share Drive files\n- Send texts or check iMessages\n\n### Example Prompts\n\n```\n\"Check my inbox for unread emails\"\n\"What's on my calendar today?\"\n\"Send an email to alice@example.com about the meeting\"\n\"Search Drive for quarterly reports\"\n\"Text +12025551234 that I'm running late\"\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>CLI Commands</strong></summary>\n\nThe plugin provides a unified CLI with subcommands. Claude invokes these\nautomatically, but you can also run them manually:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/jean-claude\nuv run jean-claude --help\nuv run jean-claude gmail --help\nuv run jean-claude gcal --help\nuv run jean-claude gdrive --help\nuv run jean-claude imessage --help  # macOS only\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Shell Completions\n\nEnable tab completion for the CLI:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/jean-claude\n\n# Bash (~/.bashrc)\neval \"$(uv run jean-claude completions bash)\"\n\n# Zsh (~/.zshrc)\neval \"$(uv run jean-claude completions zsh)\"\n\n# Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)\nuv run jean-claude completions fish | source\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Gmail\n\n- Search and list emails\n- Create, send, and manage drafts\n- Reply and forward with threading preserved\n- Star, archive/unarchive, mark read/unread, trash messages\n\n### Google Calendar\n\n- List events (today, date range, or N days)\n- Create events with attendees, location, description\n- Search, update, and delete events\n- Timezone auto-detection\n\n### Google Drive\n\n- List and search files\n- Upload and download files\n- Create folders and share files\n- Trash and restore files\n\n### iMessage (macOS only)\n\n- Send messages to individuals or groups\n- Send file attachments\n- List chats and participants\n- Search message history\n- View unread messages\n\n## Security\n\n- OAuth tokens are stored with 0600 permissions (owner read/write only)\n- Default OAuth client credentials are embedded for convenience (standard\n  practice for desktop/CLI apps per Google's guidelines)\n- Users can provide their own Google Cloud credentials if preferred\n- All email/message sends require explicit user approval\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Development</strong></summary>\n\n```bash\n# Install with dev dependencies\nuv sync\n\n# Run tests\nuv run pytest\n\n# Run lints\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
