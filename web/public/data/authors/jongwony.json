It's easier to select from presented options than to generate questions from scratch.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/jongwony/epistemic-protocols\n\n# Install what you need\n/plugin install prothesis\n/plugin install syneidesis\n/plugin install hermeneia\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/prothesis [your question]    # Get perspective options before analysis\n/syneidesis [your task]       # Enable gap surfacing during execution\n/hermeneia [your expression]  # Clarify ambiguous intent\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "prothesis/README.md": "# Prothesis\n\nPlace perspective options before inquiry (πρόθεσις: placing before)\n\n> [한국어](./README_ko.md)\n\n## What is Prothesis?\n\nA modern reinterpretation of Greek πρόθεσις (placing before) — a protocol that **presents possible epistemological perspectives before inquiry begins**.\n\n### The Core Problem\n\nUsers often don't know \"from which perspective to analyze\" (unknown unknowns). Open questions like \"What perspective do you want?\" require knowing the answer to answer.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Recognition over Recall**: Choosing from options (recognition) is easier than filling in blanks (recall). AI presents perspective options first; user selects; then analysis proceeds.\n\n### Difference from Socratic Method\n\n| Dimension | Socratic Maieutics | Prothesis |\n|-----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Knowledge source | Latent within interlocutor | Provided externally |\n| Premise | \"You already know\" | \"You don't know the options\" |\n| Role | Midwife (draws out) | Cartographer (reveals paths) |\n| Question form | Open questions (recall burden) | Options (only recognition needed) |\n\n## Protocol Flow\n\n```\nPhase 0: Gather       → Context acquisition for perspective formulation\nPhase 1: Prothesis    → Present 2-4 perspectives (invoke AskUserQuestion)\nPhase 2: Inquiry      → Parallel analysis per selected perspective (Task subagent)\nPhase 3: Synthesis    → Organize convergences/divergences → Integrated answer\n```\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use**:\n- Evaluation, comparison, recommendation requests\n- When multiple frameworks are applicable (\"from an expert perspective\", \"deep analysis\")\n\n**Skip**:\n- Simple factual questions\n- User already specified a perspective\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/prothesis [your question]\n```\n\n## Author\n\nJongwon Choi (https://github.com/jongwony)\n",
        "syneidesis/README.md": "# Syneidesis\n\nSurface potential gaps at decision points (συνείδησις: knowing-together)\n\n> [한국어](./README_ko.md)\n\n## What is Syneidesis?\n\nA modern reinterpretation of Greek συνείδησις (knowing-together) — a protocol that **positions AI as an \"auxiliary epistemic agent\"**.\n\n### Philosophical Meaning\n\nTransforms the traditional conscience (inner witness) into an externalized dialogue partner. Structures epistemic division of labor — AI handles pattern recognition, humans handle value judgment.\n\n### AI Alignment Perspective\n\nAn appropriate human-AI collaboration model for the \"weak AI\" era. Translates corrigibility into concrete behavioral rules and implements conservative failure modes (waiting on irreversible actions).\n\n### Interaction Design Perspective\n\nA refined implementation of intentional friction. Materializes the epistemic state transition from Unknown Unknowns to Known Unknowns as a UX flow.\n\n## Protocol Flow\n\n```\nPhase 0: Detection    → Scan decision point for gaps (silent)\nPhase 1: Surfacing    → Select and present gaps (invoke AskUserQuestion)\nPhase 2: Adjustment   → Incorporate response into state\n```\n\n## Core Principle\n\n**Surfacing over Deciding**: The goal is not for AI to \"make better decisions\" but to **\"illuminate cognitive blind spots so users can make better decisions\"**.\n\n## User Role\n\n**Judgment, not acknowledgment**: When a gap is surfaced, you evaluate its relevance — address it, dismiss it, or defer. The AI surfaces; you judge.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/syneidesis\n```\n\nNote: Deferring high-stakes decisions blocks progress until you provide explicit judgment.\n\n## Author\n\nJongwon Choi (https://github.com/jongwony)\n",
        "hermeneia/README.md": "# Hermeneia\n\nClarify intent-expression gaps through dialogue (ἑρμηνεία: interpretation)\n\n> [한국어](./README_ko.md)\n\n## What is Hermeneia?\n\nA modern reinterpretation of Greek ἑρμηνεία (interpretation) — a protocol that **helps users articulate what they already know but struggle to express**.\n\n### The Core Problem\n\nUsers often recognize their expression is ambiguous (known unknowns) but lack the vocabulary or structure to clarify. Open questions like \"What do you mean?\" don't help when the user already knows they're unclear.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Articulation over Assumption**: AI presents interpretation options; user recognizes their actual intent among choices. Transforms self-aware ambiguity into precise expression.\n\n### Difference from Other Protocols\n\n| Protocol | Initiator | What it transforms |\n|----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Prothesis | AI | Unknown unknowns → Known unknowns |\n| Syneidesis | AI | Unknown unknowns → Known unknowns |\n| **Hermeneia** | **User** | **Known unknowns → Known knowns** |\n\n## Protocol Flow\n\n```\nPhase 0: Trigger       → Recognize user-initiated clarification request\nPhase 1: Diagnosis     → Identify intent-expression gaps (silent)\nPhase 2: Clarification → Present options (call AskUserQuestion)\nPhase 3: Integration   → Proceed with clarified expression\n```\n\n## Gap Types\n\n| Type | Example |\n|------|---------|\n| Expression | \"Did you mean X or Y?\" |\n| Precision | \"How specifically: [options]?\" |\n| Coherence | \"You mentioned X but also Y...\" |\n| Context | \"What's the context for this?\" |\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use**:\n- When you recognize your expression might be ambiguous\n- When you're unsure how to phrase your request\n- When you want help articulating your intent\n\n**Skip**:\n- When your expression is clear\n- When AI should infer from context\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/hermeneia [your potentially ambiguous request]\n/clarify [request]\n/hmn [request]\n```\n\n## Author\n\nJongwon Choi (https://github.com/jongwony)\n"
