Open questions like \"What perspective do you want?\" require knowing the answer to answer. Beyond perspective selection, complex questions need parallel investigation from distinct viewpoints and coordinated execution.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Recognition over Recall + Team Investigation**: AI presents perspective options; user selects; an agent team investigates in parallel; findings are classified and executed with peer verification.

Translates corrigibility into concrete behavioral rules and implements conservative failure modes (waiting on irreversible actions).\n\n### Interaction Design Perspective\n\nA refined implementation of intentional friction.

Traditional requirements gathering assumes intent already exists and merely needs extraction. When intent is absent, extraction fails silently.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Construction over Extraction**: AI proposes falsifiable goal dimensions; user selects, rejects, or reshapes them. Transforms indeterminate aspiration into a concrete, actionable end-state through iterative co-construction.\n\n### Difference from Other Protocols\n\n| Protocol | Mode | Type Signature |\n|----------|------|---------------|\n| Hermeneia | EXTRACT | `IntentMisarticulated → ClarifiedIntent` |\n| **Telos** | **CO-CONSTRUCT** | **`GoalIndeterminate → DefinedEndState`** |\n\n**Key distinction**: Hermeneia assumes the user *has* an intent but struggles to express it — Telos operates when no well-formed intent exists yet.

Silent assumptions lead to wasted effort and compounding errors.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Inquiry over Assumption**: Before execution, AI scans for context gaps, attempts self-resolution through codebase exploration, and surfaces remaining gaps as structured mini-choices for the user. Transforms insufficient context into informed execution through targeted inquiry.\n\n### Difference from Other Protocols\n\n| Protocol | Mode | Type Signature |\n|----------|------|---------------|\n| Syneidesis | SURFACE | `GapUnnoticed → AuditedDecision` |\n| **Aitesis** | **INQUIRE** | **`ContextInsufficient → InformedExecution`** |\n\n**Key distinction**: Syneidesis surfaces gaps at decision points for the user to judge — information flows AI→user (metacognitive).

Without explicit calibration, the AI guesses at delegation scope, leading to friction.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Calibration over Declaration**: Through Akinator-style scenario questions (\"When you encounter X, should I...?\"), the protocol surfaces implicit delegation preferences and produces a DelegationContract that governs autonomy for the session.\n\n### Difference from Other Protocols\n\n| Protocol | Mode | Type Signature |\n|----------|------|---------------|\n| Aitesis | INQUIRE | `ContextInsufficient → InformedExecution` |\n| **Epitrope** | **CALIBRATE** | **`DelegationAmbiguous → CalibratedAutonomy`** |\n\n**Key distinction**: Aitesis asks \"do I know enough?\" (context gap).
