        "README.md": "# scratch-skills\n\nA Claude Code plugin that automates Scratch programming via Playwright.\n\n## Skills\n\n### scratch-vm-injection\n\nInjects blocks directly into the Scratch VM by serializing/deserializing the project JSON. Best for programmatically creating complete Scratch programs quickly.\n\n### scratch-block-dragging\n\nBuilds Scratch programs by dragging and dropping blocks from the palette to the script area using mouse operations. Mimics real user interaction with the Scratch editor UI.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Playwright plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/playwright) installed in Claude Code\n\n## Installation\n\n### From marketplace\n\nFirst, add the marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugins add-marketplace yokobond/scratch-skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```\n/install-plugin scratch-vm-injection\n```\n\n### From URL\n\n```\n/install-plugin https://github.com/yokobond/scratch-skills.git\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAsk Claude to create a Scratch program:\n\n```\nScratchで猫が四角形を描くプログラムを作って\n```\n\n```\nMake a Scratch project where the cat bounces around the screen\n```\n\nThe plugin handles all the low-level interaction — finding the VM instance, block manipulation, and project management — so you can focus on describing what you want.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
