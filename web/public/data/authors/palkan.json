Example for your project's `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```md\nExtend the list of **review agents** with the `layered-rails:layered-rails-reviewer` agent to check for architecture layer violations. Must be applicable to such commands from the compound-engineering plugin as `/workflow:review`, `/plan_review`, and similar.\n\nExtend the list of **planning agents** with the `layered-rails:layered-rails-gradual` agent to plan refactoring according to the layered design principles. Must be applicable to such commands from the compound-engineering plugin as `/workflow:plan`, `/deepen_plan`, and similar.\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
