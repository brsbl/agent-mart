        "README.md": "# palkan/skills\n\nA collection of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills by [Vladimir Dementyev](https://github.com/palkan).\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### Layered Rails\n\nDesign and review Rails applications using layered architecture principles from the [Layered Design for Ruby on Rails Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/layered-design-for-ruby-on-rails-applications-9781806114221) book.\n\n**Install:**\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add palkan/skills\n/plugin install layered-rails@palkan-skills\n```\n\n**Commands:**\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/layers:analyze` | Full codebase architecture analysis |\n| `/layers:analyze:callbacks` | Score model callbacks, find extraction candidates |\n| `/layers:analyze:gods` | Find god objects via churn x complexity |\n| `/layers:review` | Review code changes for layer violations |\n| `/layers:spec-test` | Run specification test on specific files |\n| `/layers:gradual [goal]` | Plan incremental adoption of layered patterns |\n\n### Integration with compound-engineering\n\nWe recommend asking Claude itself to update the instructions for Compound Engineering to include Layred Design features according to your needs. Below you can find some examples.\n\nIf you use the [compound-engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) plugin, add explicit instructions to include layered-rails planning and reviewing agents.\n\nIn your `compound-engineering.local.md` file:\n\n```md\n---\nreview_agents:\n  - layered-rails\n  - rails-reviewer\n  - security-sentinel\n  # - ...\n---\n\n# ...\n\n# also worth adding something like:\n\nWe are **gradually adopting layered design principles** from \"Layered Design for Ruby on Rails Applications\" — clean abstraction boundaries, explicit layers, and specification tests...\n\n```\n\nSimilarly, for planning features, add to your `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`, or whatever) smth like:\n\n```md\n# ...\n\n### For planning agents\n\nWhen planning new features or architectural changes, use the `layered-rails` skill for analysis:\n- `/layers:gradual` — plan incremental adoption of layered patterns\n- `/layers:analyze` — full codebase architecture analysis\n- `/layers:review` — review code from a layered architecture perspective\n- `/layers:spec-test` — apply the specification test to evaluate layer placement\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can try to add shorter instructions to `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```md\nExtend the list of **review agents** with the `layered-rails:layered-rails-reviewer` agent to check for architecture layer violations. Must be applicable to such commands from the compound-engineering plugin as `/workflow:review`, `/plan_review`, and similar.\n\nExtend the list of **planning agents** with the `layered-rails:layered-rails-gradual` agent to plan refactoring according to the layered design principles. Must be applicable to such commands from the compound-engineering plugin as `/workflow:plan`, `/deepen_plan`, and similar.\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
