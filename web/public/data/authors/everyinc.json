        "README.md": "# Compound Marketplace\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@every-env/compound-plugin)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@every-env/compound-plugin)\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring the **Compound Engineering Plugin** — tools that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.\n\n## Claude Code Install\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin\n/plugin install compound-engineering\n```\n\n## OpenCode, Codex, Droid, Cursor, Pi & Gemini (experimental) Install\n\nThis repo includes a Bun/TypeScript CLI that converts Claude Code plugins to OpenCode, Codex, Factory Droid, Cursor, Pi, and Gemini CLI.\n\n```bash\n# convert the compound-engineering plugin into OpenCode format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to opencode\n\n# convert to Codex format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to codex\n\n# convert to Factory Droid format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to droid\n\n# convert to Cursor format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to cursor\n\n# convert to Pi format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to pi\n\n# convert to Gemini CLI format\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to gemini\n```\n\nLocal dev:\n\n```bash\nbun run src/index.ts install ./plugins/compound-engineering --to opencode\n```\n\nOpenCode output is written to `~/.config/opencode` by default, with `opencode.json` at the root and `agents/`, `skills/`, and `plugins/` alongside it.\nCodex output is written to `~/.codex/prompts` and `~/.codex/skills`, with each Claude command converted into both a prompt and a skill (the prompt instructs Codex to load the corresponding skill). Generated Codex skill descriptions are truncated to 1024 characters (Codex limit).\nDroid output is written to `~/.factory/` with commands, droids (agents), and skills. Claude tool names are mapped to Factory equivalents (`Bash` → `Execute`, `Write` → `Create`, etc.) and namespace prefixes are stripped from commands.\nCursor output is written to `.cursor/` with rules (`.mdc`), commands, skills, and `mcp.json`. Agents become \"Agent Requested\" rules (`alwaysApply: false`) so Cursor's AI activates them on demand. Works with both the Cursor IDE and Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`) — they share the same `.cursor/` config directory.\nPi output is written to `~/.pi/agent/` by default with prompts, skills, extensions, and `compound-engineering/mcporter.json` for MCPorter interoperability.\nGemini output is written to `.gemini/` with skills (from agents), commands (`.toml`), and `settings.json` (MCP servers). Namespaced commands create directory structure (`workflows:plan` → `commands/workflows/plan.toml`). Skills use the identical SKILL.md standard and pass through unchanged.\n\nAll provider targets are experimental and may change as the formats evolve.\n\n## Sync Personal Config\n\nSync your personal Claude Code config (`~/.claude/`) to other AI coding tools:\n\n```bash\n# Sync skills and MCP servers to OpenCode\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target opencode\n\n# Sync to Codex\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target codex\n\n# Sync to Pi\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target pi\n\n# Sync to Droid (skills only)\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target droid\n\n# Sync to Cursor (skills + MCP servers)\nbunx @every-env/compound-plugin sync --target cursor\n```\n\nThis syncs:\n- Personal skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (as symlinks)\n- MCP servers from `~/.claude/settings.json`\n\nSkills are symlinked (not copied) so changes in Claude Code are reflected immediately.\n\n## Workflow\n\n```\nPlan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat\n```\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/workflows:plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed implementation plans |\n| `/workflows:work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |\n| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |\n| `/workflows:compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |\n\nEach cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.**\n\nTraditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. The codebase becomes harder to work with over time.\n\nCompound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:\n- Plan thoroughly before writing code\n- Review to catch issues and capture learnings\n- Codify knowledge so it's reusable\n- Keep quality high so future changes are easy\n\n## Learn More\n\n- [Full component reference](plugins/compound-engineering/README.md) - all agents, commands, skills\n- [Compound engineering: how Every codes with agents](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents)\n- [The story behind compounding engineering](https://every.to/source-code/my-ai-had-already-fixed-the-code-before-i-saw-it)\n",

        "plugins/coding-tutor/README.md": "# Coding Tutor\n\nYour personal AI tutor that creates tutorials tailored to you - using real code from your projects, building on what you already know, and tracking your progress over time.\n\n## Why\n\nAI is already smarter than any single human being across the breadth of tasks it can perform. It beats PhDs, aces entrance exams in every field, and this gap will only widen.\n\nIn this world, humans have two paths: let their cognitive capabilities decline, or rise to match AI. The long-term future of humanity depends heavily on which path we take.\n\nMy belief is simple: today's AI is smarter than any private tutor anyone on the planet can hire. So why not use it to give every human access to the best personal tutor imaginable? One that knows your background, adapts to your pace, uses your actual work as teaching material, and helps you retain what you learn.\n\nThis project starts with programming - the domain where AI has the most immediate economic impact. Use it to learn about the programs you're vibe coding and level up your skills. Don't just vibe code, vibe learn.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n/plugin install coding-tutor@claude-code-essentials\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- Personalized onboarding to understand your learning goals\n- Tutorials that use YOUR code as examples\n- Spaced repetition quiz system to reinforce learning\n- Tracks your progress across tutorials\n- Curriculum planning based on your current knowledge\n\n## Commands\n\n- `/teach-me` - Learn something new\n- `/quiz-me` - Test your retention with spaced repetition\n- `/sync-tutorials` - Sync your tutorials to GitHub for backup\n\n## Storage\n\nTutorials are stored at `~/coding-tutor-tutorials/`. This is auto-created on first use and shared across all your projects. The `source_repo` field in each tutorial tracks which codebase the examples came from.\n"
