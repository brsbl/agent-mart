        "README.md": "# quick-review\n\nA Claude Code plugin for better coding habits.\n\n## Features\n\n**Auto-review commits** - When Claude commits code, an async reviewer is automatically spawned. The review comes back later with suggestions, and Claude is encouraged to fix correct comments without waiting for you.\n\n**Plan commit check** - When Claude tries to exit plan mode, it's blocked unless the plan mentions \"commit\". This encourages planning for small, self-contained commits upfront.\n\n**Write counter** - After every 5 file writes, Claude is reminded to commit small self-contained changes.\n\n**Large commit warning** - When Claude makes a commit over 100 lines, it's reminded that small, self-contained commits are preferred.\n\n**Comment quality check** - When Claude writes a new comment, it's reminded that redundant comments are bad and asked if this comment seems necessary. This often leads Claude to remove unnecessary comments on its own.\n\n**Package management** - When Claude tries to add a package by editing package.json or pyproject.toml directly, it's blocked and reminded to use the command line (`npm install` or `uv add`).\n\n**WebFetch tip** - When Claude uses WebFetch, it's reminded that downloading the full page often works better than the filtered extraction.\n\n**Brainstorm mode** - When you ask to \"brainstorm\" or \"find ideas\", Claude launches 3 parallel subagents with different perspectives: a pain-points analyst, a minimal-code advocate, and a battle-seasoned CTO.\n\n**Stack recommendations** - Tips for starting new projects (Vite+React, uv for Python, etc.)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **jq** - Required for most hooks. Install with `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux). If missing, you'll see a warning at session start and hooks will be disabled.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Via slash commands\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add hibukki/yonatans-cc-marketplace\n/plugin install quick-review@yonatans-cc-marketplace\n```\n\n### Option 2: Manual (in settings.json)\n\nAdd to your `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"quick-review@yonatans-cc-marketplace\": true\n  },\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": {\n    \"yonatans-cc-marketplace\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"source\": \"github\",\n        \"repo\": \"hibukki/yonatans-cc-marketplace\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Setup (for contributors)\n\n```bash\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\n```\n\nThis enables the pre-commit hook that auto-bumps the plugin version.\n\n## Other plugins that seem promising\n\n### Search\n\n[exa MCP](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/exa-mcp)\n\n### Getting docs\n\nAs markdown, with optimizations for LLMs\n\n[context7](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/external_plugins/context7)\n\n### Interacting with a browser\n\n[dev browser](https://github.com/SawyerHood/dev-browser)\n\nSeems more promising than the playwright MCP and the claude chrome plugin.\n"
