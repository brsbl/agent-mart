        "README.md": "# Claude Code Plugins - Task & Development Plan Management\n\nA comprehensive plugin suite for Claude Code that streamlines software development workflows from task creation through development planning to architectural review.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository contains two integrated plugins that work together to create a complete development workflow:\n\n- **task**: Create and manage software development tasks with structured requirements\n- **dev-plan**: Generate detailed development plans and conduct architectural reviews\n\n## Plugins\n\n### Task Plugin\n\nCreate well-structured tasks for software development projects with standardized formatting and comprehensive details.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Interactive task creation with complexity-based workflows\n- Support for multiple task types (Story, Task, Bug)\n- Automatic codebase analysis for complex tasks\n- Standardized output format for consistency\n\n### Dev-Plan Plugin\n\nTransform tasks into detailed development plans and ensure architectural quality through comprehensive reviews.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Generate actionable implementation roadmaps from task descriptions\n- Conduct architectural reviews with multi-dimensional analysis\n- Interactive correction workflow for identified issues\n- Automatic plan updates based on review recommendations\n\n## Complete Workflow\n\n### 1. Create a Task\n\nUse the `/task:create` command to create a structured task with a detailed description:\n\n```bash\n/task:create I need to implement Redis caching for the additional amenities API endpoint.\nCurrently, the endpoint fetches data directly from MongoDB using an aggregation pipeline,\nwhich takes around 100-300ms. We need to cache this data since amenities change infrequently.\nThe cache should be company-specific and automatically invalidated when properties are updated.\nPlease review the existing implementation in @api/modules/property/controllers/PropertyController.php\nand follow patterns from @api/components/services/cache/WebsitesettingRedisCacheService.php.\nThe endpoint is used by the frontend property form at @frontend/src/components/PropertyForm.tsx.\n```\n\n### 2. Create a Development Plan\n\nUse the `/dev-plan:create` command to transform your task into a detailed implementation plan:\n\n```bash\n/dev-plan:create Create a development plan for task gh-7097. The task involves implementing\nRedis caching for the additional amenities API endpoint. Make sure to analyze the current\nimplementation and propose a cache-first strategy with automatic invalidation.\n```\n\n### 3. Review the Development Plan\n\nUse the `/dev-plan:review` command to conduct architectural review:\n\n```bash\n/dev-plan:review @docs/dev-plans/gh-7097-redis-caching-amenities.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, questions, or feature requests, please open an issue on GitHub.\n"
