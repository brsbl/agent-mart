        "README.md": "# bits\n\n> **Minimal task tracking for AI agents — one active task, zero distractions**\n\nbits is a file-based task tracker designed for AI coding agents. It enforces a\nsingle active task at a time, preventing agents from context-switching and\nlosing focus.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **One task at a time**: Only one task can be active. This constraint keeps\n  agents focused and prevents half-finished work.\n- **File-based storage**: Tasks are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Human\n  readable, no database required.\n- **Git repository scoping**: Tasks are scoped to the git repository you're\n  working in. Different projects have different task lists.\n- **Dependencies with cycle detection**: Tasks can depend on other tasks. bits\n  prevents circular dependencies.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From source\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/abatilo/bits/cmd/bits@latest\n```\n\n### Build locally\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/abatilo/bits.git\ncd bits\ngo build -o bits ./cmd/bits\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Initialize bits for this repository\nbits init\n\n# Add a task\nbits add \"Fix the login bug\" -d \"Users can't log in with email addresses containing a plus sign\"\n\n# See what's ready to work on\nbits ready\n\n# Start working on a task\nbits claim abc123\n\n# When done, close it with a reason\nbits close abc123 \"Fixed in commit 1a2b3c4\"\n```\n\n## Command Reference\n\nAll commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.\n\n### init\n\nInitialize bits for the current git repository.\n\n```bash\nbits init\nbits init --force  # Reinitialize even if already exists\n```\n\n### add\n\nCreate a new task.\n\n```bash\nbits add \"Task title\"\nbits add \"Task title\" -d \"Detailed description\"\nbits add \"Urgent fix\" -p critical  # Priority: critical, high, medium, low\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[abc123] Task title\n  Status:   open\n  Priority: medium\n  Created:  2025-01-19 10:30\n```\n\n### list\n\nList tasks with optional status filters.\n\n```bash\nbits list              # All tasks\nbits list --open       # Only open tasks\nbits list --active     # Only active tasks\nbits list --closed     # Only closed tasks\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[*] P1 [def456] Implement caching\n[ ] P2 [abc123] Fix the login bug\n[X] P3 [ghi789] Update readme\n```\n\nStatus icons: `[ ]` open, `[*]` active, `[X]` closed\nPriority marks: `P0` critical, `P1` high, `P2` medium, `P3` low\n\n### show\n\nDisplay full details of a task.\n\n```bash\nbits show abc123\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[abc123] Fix the login bug\n  Status:   open\n  Priority: medium\n  Created:  2025-01-19 10:30\n  Depends:  xyz789\n\nUsers can't log in with email addresses containing a plus sign.\n```\n\n### ready\n\nList tasks that are ready to be worked on (open, with all dependencies closed).\n\n```bash\nbits ready\n```\n\n### claim\n\nStart working on a task. The task must be open and all its dependencies must be\nclosed. Only one task can be active at a time.\n\n```bash\nbits claim abc123\n```\n\nErrors:\n- If another task is already active\n- If the task has unclosed dependencies\n- If the task is not in `open` status\n\n### release\n\nStop working on a task without completing it. Returns it to `open` status.\n\n```bash\nbits release abc123\n```\n\n### close\n\nComplete a task. Requires a reason explaining what was done.\n\n```bash\nbits close abc123 \"Fixed in commit 1a2b3c4\"\n```\n\nThe task must be in `active` status to be closed.\n\n### dep\n\nAdd a dependency. The first task will depend on the second task.\n\n```bash\nbits dep abc123 xyz789  # abc123 depends on xyz789\n```\n\nbits prevents circular dependencies. If adding the dependency would create a\ncycle, the command fails.\n\n### undep\n\nRemove a dependency.\n\n```bash\nbits undep abc123 xyz789\n```\n\n### rm\n\nRemove a task and clean up any references to it in other tasks' dependencies.\n\n```bash\nbits rm abc123\n```\n\n### prune\n\nRemove all closed tasks.\n\n```bash\nbits prune\n```\n\n### session\n\nSession management commands for Claude Code integration. These commands support\nmulti-instance scenarios where multiple Claude Code sessions may be running.\n\n#### session claim\n\nClaim primary session ownership for this project. Reads session info from stdin.\n\n```bash\necho '{\"session_id\": \"abc\", \"source\": \"claude-code\"}' | bits session claim\n```\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"claimed\": true}\n```\n\nIf another session already owns this project:\n```json\n{\"claimed\": false, \"owner\": \"existing-session-id\"}\n```\n\n#### session release\n\nRelease session ownership. Only the owner can release.\n\n```bash\necho '{\"session_id\": \"abc\", \"source\": \"claude-code\"}' | bits session release\n```\n\n#### session prune\n\nManually remove a stale session file.\n\n```bash\nbits session prune\n```\n\n#### session hook\n\nStop hook with session ownership check. Only blocks if:\n1. This session is the owner (session_id matches)\n2. Drain mode is active\n3. Tasks remain (active or open)\n\n```bash\necho '{\"session_id\": \"abc\", \"source\": \"claude-code\"}' | bits session hook\n```\n\n### drain\n\nDrain mode commands for working through all tasks before exiting.\n\n#### drain claim\n\nActivate drain mode. Uses the session owner from the session file.\n\n```bash\nbits drain claim\n```\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"success\": true, \"drain_active\": true, \"message\": \"Drain mode activated\"}\n```\n\nDrain mode is automatically deactivated when the stop hook detects all tasks are complete.\n\n#### drain release\n\nDeactivate drain mode manually.\n\n```bash\nbits drain release\n```\n\n## Storage Format\n\nTasks are stored in `~/.bits/<sanitized-project-path>/`.\n\nFor example, if your project is at `/Users/alice/projects/myapp`, tasks are\nstored in `~/.bits/Users-alice-projects-myapp/`.\n\nEach task is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\nid: abc123\ntitle: Fix the login bug\nstatus: open\npriority: medium\ncreated_at: 2025-01-19T10:30:00Z\ndepends_on:\n  - xyz789\n---\n\nUsers can't log in with email addresses containing a plus sign.\nThe `+` character is being URL-encoded incorrectly.\n```\n\n### Task Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `id` | 3-8 character identifier (auto-generated, grows to avoid collisions) |\n| `title` | Short task title |\n| `status` | `open`, `active`, or `closed` |\n| `priority` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low` |\n| `created_at` | RFC3339 timestamp |\n| `closed_at` | RFC3339 timestamp (when closed) |\n| `close_reason` | Why the task was closed |\n| `depends_on` | List of task IDs this task depends on |\n\n## Task Lifecycle\n\n```\nopen ──claim──> active ──close──> closed\n  ^               │\n  └───release─────┘\n```\n\n- **open**: Task exists but no one is working on it\n- **active**: Task is being worked on (only one allowed)\n- **closed**: Task is complete\n\n## Claude Code Integration\n\n### Plugin Installation\n\nbits includes a Claude Code plugin with skills, commands, and hooks for seamless integration.\n\n**1. Add the bits marketplace to your `claude_settings.json`:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": {\n    \"bits-plugins\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"type\": \"path\",\n        \"path\": \"/path/to/bits\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**2. Enable the plugin:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"bits@bits-plugins\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### What the Plugin Provides\n\n| Component | Name | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Skill | `bits` | Task tracking - create, claim, release, close tasks |\n| Skill | `bits-plan` | Extract tasks from conversations using Codex MCP |\n| Command | `/bits-drain` | Work through all ready tasks before exiting |\n| Hooks | Session lifecycle | Automatic session claim/release and drain mode blocking |\n\n### Manual Hook Configuration\n\nIf you prefer to configure hooks manually without the plugin:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"SessionStart\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bits session claim\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"SessionEnd\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bits session release\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Stop\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bits session hook\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe stop hook only blocks exit when:\n1. This session is the primary owner\n2. Drain mode is active (`bits drain claim` was called)\n3. Tasks remain to be completed\n\nWhen all tasks are complete, drain mode is automatically deactivated.\n\n## Multi-Instance Support\n\nbits supports multiple Claude Code instances working on the same project:\n\n| Scenario | Behavior |\n|----------|----------|\n| First Claude starts | Claims session, becomes primary |\n| Second Claude starts | Sees existing session, does nothing |\n| Primary runs drain mode | Exit blocked until tasks complete |\n| Secondary tries to exit | Always allowed (not primary) |\n| Primary exits normally | Session released, file deleted |\n| Stale session | Use `bits session prune` to clean up |\n\nThis enables workflows like:\n- Planning instances that create tasks and exit freely\n- Work instances that drain all tasks before exiting\n- Multiple parallel read-only instances\n\n## JSON Output\n\nAll commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:\n\n```bash\nbits list --json\n```\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"abc123\",\n    \"title\": \"Fix the login bug\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": \"medium\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2025-01-19T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"depends_on\": [\"xyz789\"],\n    \"description\": \"Users can't log in with email addresses containing a plus sign.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.
