        "README.md": "# Scaffold\n\nA guided AI pipeline that takes you from \"I have an idea\" to working software. Scaffold walks you through 29 structured prompts — run them in order, and Claude Code handles the research, planning, and implementation for you.\n\nBy the end, you'll have a fully planned, standards-documented, implementation-ready project with working code.\n\n## What is Scaffold?\n\nScaffold is a pipeline of AI-powered prompts designed for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's command-line coding tool. If you have an idea for a software project but don't know where to start — or you want to make sure your project is set up with solid architecture, standards, and tests from day one — Scaffold guides you through every step.\n\nHere's how it works: you install Scaffold, then run slash commands like `/scaffold:create-prd` in Claude Code. Each command is a carefully structured prompt that tells Claude exactly what to research, what decisions to make, and what files to create. You don't need to write the prompts yourself — just run the commands and answer Claude's questions along the way.\n\nEach step in the pipeline produces a specific artifact — a planning document, a configuration file, a standards guide, or actual code — and then tells you exactly which command to run next. You follow the chain from defining your product all the way through to a working implementation.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using Scaffold, you'll need the following tools installed:\n\n### Required\n\n**Node.js** (v18 or later)\nNeeded for Beads and most modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects.\n- Install: https://nodejs.org or `brew install node`\n- Verify: `node --version`\n\n**Git**\nNeeded for version control and Beads task tracking.\n- Install: https://git-scm.com or `brew install git`\n- Verify: `git --version`\n\n**Claude Code**\nThe AI coding assistant that runs the Scaffold prompts. Claude Code is a command-line tool from Anthropic — it's not the same as the Claude web chat.\n- Install: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`\n- Verify: `claude --version`\n- Docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\n\n**Beads**\nA git-backed task tracker designed for AI agents. Scaffold uses Beads (`bd`) to create and manage the task graph that drives implementation. Think of it as a to-do list that both you and Claude can read and update.\n- Install: `npm install -g @beads/bd`\n- Verify: `bd --version`\n- Repo: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\n\n### Optional\n\n**Playwright MCP** (web apps only)\nLets Claude control a real browser for visual testing and screenshots. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a way for Claude to use external tools — in this case, a headless browser.\n- Install: `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest`\n- Only needed if your project has a web frontend\n\n**ChatGPT subscription** (for multi-model review)\nOne optional step (`multi-model-review`) sets up automated code review using both Claude and OpenAI's Codex. This requires a ChatGPT subscription (Plus, Pro, or Team) — reviews use credits (~25 per review) with weekly limits that vary by plan. You can skip this step entirely if you don't have one.\n\n**Codex CLI and/or Gemini CLI** (for user stories multi-model review)\nOne optional step (`user-stories-multi-model-review`) runs independent AI reviewers against your user stories to catch gaps a single model might miss. You need at least one of: Codex CLI (requires ChatGPT subscription) or Gemini CLI (free tier available). See [Multi-Model Stories Review Setup](docs/multi-model-stories-review-setup.md) for detailed instructions.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install Scaffold. Both give you the same commands — the only difference is the prefix you type.\n\n### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (recommended)\n\nOpen Claude Code and run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add zigrivers/scaffold\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install scaffold@zigrivers-scaffold\n```\n\nAfter installing, commands are available as `/scaffold:command-name` (for example, `/scaffold:create-prd`).\n\n**What's a plugin?** Claude Code plugins are add-on command packages. When you install one, its commands become available as slash commands you can run in any Claude Code session. The plugin prefix (`/scaffold:`) keeps them organized and separate from other commands.\n\n### Option 2: User Commands (shorter prefix)\n\nIf you prefer a shorter prefix, clone the repo and run the install script:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zigrivers/scaffold\ncd scaffold && ./scripts/install.sh\n```\n\nCommands are available as `/user:command-name` (for example, `/user:create-prd`).\n\nTo uninstall later: `./scripts/uninstall.sh`\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installing, open Claude Code and run:\n\n```\n/scaffold:prompt-pipeline\n```\n\n(or `/user:prompt-pipeline` if you used Option 2)\n\nThis prints the full pipeline reference. If you see a table of phases and commands, you're all set.\n\n## Updating\n\nWhen new prompts or fixes are released, update to get the latest versions.\n\n### Plugin installs\n\nFrom a Claude Code session:\n\n```\n/scaffold:update\n```\n\nOr update the plugin directly:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace update zigrivers-scaffold\n```\n\n### User command installs\n\nFrom a Claude Code session:\n\n```\n/user:update\n```\n\nOr from the terminal:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/update.sh\n```\n\nIf you no longer have the repo cloned locally, the update command will fetch it automatically.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nHere's what the first few steps look like in practice:\n\n**1. Create a new directory and open Claude Code**\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-project && cd my-project\ngit init\nclaude\n```\n\n**2. Define your product**\n\n```\n/scaffold:create-prd I want to build a recipe sharing app where users can save, organize, and share recipes with friends\n```\n\nClaude will ask you clarifying questions about your idea, research best practices, and produce `docs/plan.md` — a detailed product requirements document (PRD). This becomes the foundation that all later steps build on.\n\n**3. Analyze the PRD for gaps**\n\n```\n/scaffold:prd-gap-analysis\n```\n\nClaude reviews the PRD it just created, identifies missing pieces, suggests innovations, and updates the plan with your approval.\n\n**4. Set up task tracking**\n\n```\n/scaffold:beads\n```\n\nThis initializes Beads in your project and creates the `CLAUDE.md` file — a configuration file that tells Claude how to work in your project.\n\n**5. Keep following the chain**\n\nEach command tells you what to run next when it finishes. Just follow the prompts through Phase 2 (project foundation), Phase 3 (dev environment), and beyond. The pipeline is designed so you never have to wonder \"what's next?\"\n\n## The Full Pipeline\n\n### Phase 0 — Prerequisites (one-time setup)\n\n| Action | Command |\n|--------|---------|\n| Install Beads | `npm install -g @beads/bd` |\n| Install Playwright MCP | `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest` **(optional — web apps only)** |\n\n### Phase 1 — Product Definition\n\nDefine what you're building.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does |\n|---|---------|-------------|\n| 1 | `/scaffold:create-prd` | Creates `docs/plan.md` — a detailed product requirements document from your idea |\n| 2 | `/scaffold:prd-gap-analysis` | Reviews the PRD for missing pieces and suggests innovations |\n\n### Phase 2 — Project Foundation\n\nEstablish the technical decisions and standards for your project.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does |\n|---|---------|-------------|\n| 3 | `/scaffold:beads` | Initializes Beads task tracking and creates `CLAUDE.md` |\n| 4 | `/scaffold:tech-stack` | Researches and documents technology choices in `docs/tech-stack.md` |\n| 5 | `/scaffold:claude-code-permissions` | Configures permissions so Claude can work without asking for approval on every action |\n| 6 | `/scaffold:coding-standards` | Creates `docs/coding-standards.md` with conventions, patterns, and linting rules |\n| 7 | `/scaffold:tdd` | Creates `docs/tdd-standards.md` with test-driven development practices |\n| 8 | `/scaffold:project-structure` | Defines and scaffolds the directory structure with `docs/project-structure.md` |\n\n### Phase 3 — Development Environment\n\nGet the dev server running and set up collaboration infrastructure.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does | Notes |\n|---|---------|-------------|-------|\n| 9 | `/scaffold:dev-env-setup` | Sets up dev server, database, environment variables, and `docs/dev-setup.md` | |\n| 10 | `/scaffold:design-system` | Creates a design system with components, colors, and typography | **Optional** — frontend projects only |\n| 11 | `/scaffold:git-workflow` | Configures branching strategy, CI pipeline, and parallel agent worktrees in `docs/git-workflow.md` | |\n| 11.5 | `/scaffold:multi-model-review` | Sets up automated code review using Claude and OpenAI Codex on PRs | **Optional** — requires ChatGPT subscription (credits) |\n\n### Phase 4 — Testing Integration\n\nAdd end-to-end testing for your platform.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does | Notes |\n|---|---------|-------------|-------|\n| 12 | `/scaffold:add-playwright` | Configures Playwright for browser-based visual testing | **Optional** — web apps only |\n| 13 | `/scaffold:add-maestro` | Configures Maestro for mobile UI testing | **Optional** — Expo/mobile apps only |\n\n### Phase 5 — Stories & Planning\n\nBreak the PRD down into implementable user stories.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does | Notes |\n|---|---------|-------------|-------|\n| 14 | `/scaffold:user-stories` | Creates `docs/user-stories.md` with detailed stories for every PRD feature | |\n| 15 | `/scaffold:user-stories-gaps` | Gap analysis and UX innovation pass on user stories | |\n| 15.5 | `/scaffold:user-stories-multi-model-review` | Multi-model coverage audit with Codex/Gemini reviewers | **Optional** — requires Codex/Gemini CLI |\n| 16 | `/scaffold:platform-parity-review` | Audits docs for platform coverage gaps | **Optional** — multi-platform projects only |\n\n### Phase 6 — Consolidation & Verification\n\nMake sure everything is consistent before implementation begins.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does |\n|---|---------|-------------|\n| 17 | `/scaffold:claude-md-optimization` | Restructures and optimizes `CLAUDE.md` as the single source of truth |\n| 18 | `/scaffold:workflow-audit` | Verifies all docs are consistent on workflow, naming, and processes |\n\n### Phase 7 — Implementation\n\nBuild the actual software.\n\n| # | Command | What It Does |\n|---|---------|-------------|\n| 19 | `/scaffold:implementation-plan` | Creates a full task graph in Beads from user stories and standards |\n| 20 | `/scaffold:implementation-plan-review` | Reviews task quality, coverage, dependencies, and sizing |\n| 21 | `/scaffold:single-agent-start` | Starts the autonomous implementation loop — Claude picks up tasks and builds |\n\n## Understanding the Pipeline Flow\n\nNot every step applies to every project. Here's how to navigate the optional steps:\n\n### Web App (React, Next.js, etc.)\n\nRun the full pipeline including:\n- `/scaffold:design-system` (Phase 3) — for your UI components\n- `/scaffold:add-playwright` (Phase 4) — for browser testing\n\n### Mobile App (Expo / React Native)\n\nRun the full pipeline including:\n- `/scaffold:design-system` (Phase 3) — for your UI components\n- `/scaffold:add-maestro` (Phase 4) — for mobile UI testing\n\n### Backend / CLI / API-only\n\nSkip these optional steps:\n- Skip `/scaffold:design-system` — no frontend to design\n- Skip `/scaffold:add-playwright` — no browser to test\n- Skip `/scaffold:add-maestro` — no mobile app to test\n\n### Multi-platform (web + mobile)\n\nRun everything above, including both Playwright and Maestro, plus:\n- `/scaffold:platform-parity-review` (Phase 5) — ensures all platforms have equal feature coverage\n\n### Other optional steps\n\n- `/scaffold:multi-model-review` — requires a ChatGPT subscription (Plus/Pro/Team). Sets up a two-tier automated code review (Claude + OpenAI Codex) on every PR. Reviews use credits (~25 per review, weekly limits). Skip it if you don't have a ChatGPT subscription.\n- `/scaffold:user-stories-multi-model-review` — runs independent Codex and/or Gemini reviews of your user stories against the PRD. Requires at least one of: Codex CLI (ChatGPT subscription) or Gemini CLI (free tier available). See [setup guide](docs/multi-model-stories-review-setup.md).\n- `/scaffold:platform-parity-review` — only needed if your project targets multiple platforms (e.g., web + iOS + Android). Skip it for single-platform projects.\n\n## After the Pipeline: Ongoing Commands\n\nOnce your project is scaffolded and you're building features, these commands are available anytime:\n\n| Command | When to Use |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/scaffold:new-enhancement` | You want to add a new feature to an already-scaffolded project. It updates the PRD, creates new user stories, and sets up Beads tasks with proper dependencies. |\n| `/scaffold:quick-task` | You need a focused Beads task for a bug fix, refactor, performance improvement, or small refinement — work that needs clear acceptance criteria and a test plan but not full enhancement discovery. |\n| `/scaffold:version-bump` | You've completed a set of user stories or reached a milestone and want to mark it with a version number — but you're not ready to create a tag or GitHub release yet. It bumps the version, updates the changelog, and commits. No tags, no push, no release ceremony. |\n| `/scaffold:release` | You're ready to ship a new version. It analyzes your commits, suggests a version bump (major/minor/patch), updates the changelog, bumps the version number in your project files, and creates a Git tag and GitHub release. Supports `--dry-run` to preview changes, `current` to release an already-bumped version, and `rollback` to undo a bad release. |\n| `/scaffold:single-agent-resume` | You closed Claude Code and want to pick up where you left off. It checks your current git state, finds in-progress tasks, and resumes the workflow. |\n| `/scaffold:prompt-pipeline` | Quick reference — prints the full pipeline table so you can see where you are and what's next. |\n| `/scaffold:implementation-plan-review` | Re-run after creating 5+ new tasks to audit quality and dependencies. |\n| `/scaffold:platform-parity-review` | Re-run after adding platform-specific features to check for coverage gaps. |\n| `/scaffold:multi-model-review` | Runs automatically on every PR once configured. |\n\n## Releasing Your Project\n\n### Version bumps (development milestones)\n\nDuring development, you may want to mark milestones — like completing a set of user stories — without the full release ceremony:\n\n```\n/scaffold:version-bump\n```\n\nThis bumps the version number and updates the changelog, but doesn't create tags, push, or publish a GitHub release. Think of it as a checkpoint. You can specify the bump type explicitly (`/scaffold:version-bump minor`) or let Claude analyze your commits to suggest one.\n\n### Creating a release\n\nOnce you've built features and are ready to ship a version, use the release command:\n\n### Create a release\n\n```\n/scaffold:release\n```\n\nClaude analyzes your commits since the last release, suggests whether this is a major, minor, or patch version bump (based on your commit messages), and walks you through:\n1. Running your project's tests to make sure everything passes\n2. Updating the version number in your project files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)\n3. Generating a changelog entry from your commit history\n4. Creating a Git tag and GitHub release\n\nYou confirm each step before it happens.\n\n### Preview without executing\n\n```\n/scaffold:release --dry-run\n```\n\nShows you exactly what would happen — version bump, changelog preview, files that would change — without actually modifying anything. Use this when you want to check before committing.\n\n### Specify the version bump\n\n```\n/scaffold:release minor\n```\n\nSkip the auto-suggestion and tell Claude exactly what type of bump you want: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.\n\n### Undo a release\n\n```\n/scaffold:release rollback\n```\n\nMade a mistake? This deletes the GitHub release, removes the Git tag, and reverts the version bump commit. You'll need to confirm by typing the exact tag name as a safety measure.\n\n### Release an already-bumped version\n\nIf you already bumped the version with `/scaffold:version-bump`, the release command detects this and offers to release that version as-is — no double-bumping. You can also be explicit:\n\n```\n/scaffold:release current\n```\n\nThis tags and publishes the version already in your files without bumping further.\n\n### First release\n\nIf your project has never been released (no Git tags), the command detects this automatically and guides you through choosing an initial version number and setting up your changelog.\n\n## Glossary\n\nTerms you'll encounter throughout the pipeline:\n\n| Term | What It Means |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Beads / `bd`** | A task tracker built for AI agents. Like a to-do list that Claude can read, create tasks in, and mark complete. Tasks are stored in git so they're versioned with your code. |\n| **CLAUDE.md** | A configuration file in your project root that tells Claude Code how to work in your project — what commands to run, what conventions to follow, and how to handle git workflow. |\n| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. A way for Claude to use external tools. For example, the Playwright MCP lets Claude control a web browser for testing. |\n| **PRD** | Product Requirements Document. The detailed plan for what you're building — features, user flows, data models, and success metrics. Created in Phase 1. |\n| **Slash commands** | Commands you type in Claude Code that start with `/`. For example, `/scaffold:create-prd` runs the PRD creation prompt. |\n| **TDD** | Test-Driven Development. A practice where you write a failing test first, then write code to make it pass. Scaffold sets up TDD standards in Phase 2. |\n| **Worktrees** | A git feature that lets you have multiple working copies of your repo at the same time. Scaffold uses these to run multiple Claude Code agents in parallel without conflicts. |\n| **Frontmatter** | The YAML metadata block at the top of command files, between `---` markers. Contains the command description and configuration. |\n\n## Troubleshooting / FAQ\n\n**I ran a command and nothing happened.**\nMake sure the plugin is installed — run `/scaffold:prompt-pipeline` and check that it prints a table. If it says \"unknown command,\" re-run the installation step.\n\n**Which steps can I skip?**\nOnly the ones marked **optional** in the pipeline tables above. See [Understanding the Pipeline Flow](#understanding-the-pipeline-flow) for guidance on which optional steps apply to your project type.\n\n**Can I go back and re-run a step?**\nYes. Most steps are idempotent — they'll update existing files rather than creating duplicates. This is especially useful for the gap analysis and review steps.\n\n**Do I need to run every step in one sitting?**\nNo. You can stop after any step and come back later. When you return, use `/scaffold:single-agent-resume` if you're in the implementation phase, or just run the next command in the pipeline.\n\n**What if Claude asks me a question I don't know the answer to?**\nIt's fine to say you're not sure. Claude will suggest reasonable defaults and explain the trade-offs. You can always revisit decisions later.\n\n**How do I know which command to run next?**\nEvery command prints \"After This Step\" guidance when it finishes, telling you exactly what to run next (including which optional steps to skip based on your project type).\n\n**How do I get the latest prompts?**\nRun `/scaffold:update` (or `/user:update`) from a Claude Code session. This fetches the latest version and updates your command files. You can also run `./scripts/update.sh` from the terminal. See [Updating](#updating) for details.\n\n**How do I create a release?**\nRun `/scaffold:release`. It analyzes your commits, suggests a version number, and handles the changelog, Git tag, and GitHub release for you. Use `--dry-run` first if you want to preview what will happen. For lighter-weight milestone markers (no tags or GitHub release), use `/scaffold:version-bump` instead.\n\n**Can I use this for an existing project?**\nScaffold is designed for new projects. For existing projects, you can use `/scaffold:new-enhancement` to add features or `/scaffold:quick-task` for bug fixes and small improvements, both using the same structured approach. The full pipeline assumes a fresh start.\n\n## How It Works (for contributors)\n\nThe pipeline lives in a few key places:\n\n- **`prompts.md`** — The source of truth. Contains all 29 prompts in a single file with a setup order table at the top and individual prompt sections below.\n- **`commands/`** — Individual `.md` files (one per command) with YAML frontmatter and \"After This Step\" guidance. These are what Claude Code actually executes when you run a slash command.\n- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Plugin manifest that tells Claude Code the plugin's name and metadata.\n- **`skills/scaffold-pipeline/SKILL.md`** — Auto-activated skill that provides pipeline context.\n- **`scripts/`** — Install, uninstall, and command extraction scripts.\n\nThe relationship between `prompts.md` and `commands/`: the prompt content comes from `prompts.md`, while frontmatter and \"After This Step\" sections are maintained only in the `commands/` files. If you edit a prompt, update both places.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Edit `prompts.md` (the source of truth for prompt content)\n2. Update the corresponding file in `commands/` with any content changes\n3. If adding a new command, update the frontmatter mapping in `scripts/extract-commands.sh`\n4. Keep the setup order table at the top of `prompts.md` in sync with actual prompt sections\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
