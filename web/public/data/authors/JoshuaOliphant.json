        "README.md": "# Claude Code Plugin Marketplace\n\nA collection of Claude Code plugins for productivity and learning workflows.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### mochi-creator\n\n**Version 1.1.0** - Create evidence-based spaced repetition flashcards using cognitive science principles from Andy Matuschak's research.\n\n**What Makes This Different:**\nThis plugin doesn't just create flashcards—it applies research-backed principles to ensure cards actually work for long-term retention. Based on Andy Matuschak's extensive work on spaced repetition and retrieval practice.\n\n**Core Features:**\n- **Quality Validation**: Checks prompts against 5 properties (focused, precise, consistent, tractable, effortful)\n- **Evidence-Based Design**: Applies cognitive science principles to every card\n- **Knowledge-Type Workflows**: Specialized patterns for factual, conceptual, procedural, and salience prompts\n- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Identifies and fixes common mistakes (binary questions, unfocused prompts, vague language)\n- **5 Conceptual Lenses**: Creates robust understanding through multiple angles (attributes, similarities, parts, causes, significance)\n- **Procedural Patterns**: Focus on transitions, rationale, and timing instead of rote memorization\n- **Interactive Creation**: Guided workflows with quality checks at every step\n- **Template Support**: Build reusable card formats with custom fields\n- **Deck Management**: Hierarchical organization and batch operations\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Mochi.cards account and API key\n- Python with `requests` library\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```bash\n# Add this marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add joshuaoliphant/claude-plugins\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install mochi-creator@oliphant-plugins\n```\n\n**Setup:**\n\nSet your Mochi API key as an environment variable:\n```bash\nexport MOCHI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n```\n\nTo get your API key:\n1. Open Mochi.cards application\n2. Navigate to Account Settings\n3. Find the API Keys section\n4. Generate a new API key\n\n**Quick Start:**\n\nHere's the simplest way to get started—create flashcards about a basic concept:\n\n1. Set your API key: `export MOCHI_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"`\n2. Invoke the plugin: \"Create Mochi cards to help me understand what recursion is\"\n3. Get evidence-based flashcards: Cards appear in your Mochi deck with focused, atomic prompts\n\nThat's it! The plugin handles quality validation and cognitive science principles automatically.\n\n**Usage Examples:**\n\nSimple requests:\n- \"Create Mochi cards about dependency injection\" → Creates 5-8 focused, atomic cards\n- \"Turn this conversation into flashcards\" → Extracts key concepts with quality validation\n- \"Help me create flashcards for learning React hooks\" → Interactive workflow with guidance\n\nAdvanced workflows:\n- \"Create conceptual cards for TDD using the 5 lenses approach\" → Attributes, similarities, examples, causes, significance\n- \"Make procedural cards for git workflow focusing on transitions and rationale\" → No rote steps, emphasis on understanding\n- \"Create factual cards from this recipe\" → Breaks into atomic prompts automatically\n\nQuality-focused:\n- Claude will proactively validate prompts and suggest improvements\n- Detects unfocused prompts: \"This tests 3 details - let me split into separate cards\"\n- Identifies anti-patterns: \"This is a binary question - let me rephrase as open-ended\"\n- Applies knowledge-type appropriate patterns automatically\n\n**The \"More Than You Think\" Rule:**\nThe plugin encourages creating 3-5 focused cards instead of 1 comprehensive card. Each focused prompt takes only 10-30 seconds across an entire year of review, but creates much stronger, more reliable memories.\n\n**Research Foundation:**\n\nThis plugin is built on cognitive science research including:\n- **Retrieval Practice** (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): Active recall strengthens memory more than passive review\n- **Spacing Effect** (Ebbinghaus, 1885; Cepeda et al., 2006): Distributed practice beats massed practice\n- **Elaborative Encoding** (Craik & Lockhart, 1972): Deeper processing creates stronger memories\n- **Desirable Difficulties** (Bjork, 1994): Optimal learning occurs with moderate challenge\n- Andy Matuschak's extensive work on prompt design and spaced repetition systems\n\nThe 5 properties framework, knowledge-type patterns, and quality validation are all grounded in this research to ensure cards that actually work for long-term retention.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

        "plugins/autonomous-sdlc/README.md": "# Autonomous SDLC Plugin\n\nVerification-driven software development lifecycle for Claude Code. This plugin enables autonomous feature development through:\n\n- **Parallel Worktrees**: Each feature is implemented in an isolated git worktree\n- **Async Subagents**: Multiple features can be implemented concurrently\n- **Beads Integration**: Work tracking via `bd` commands with dependency management\n- **Verification-Driven**: Tests, linting, and type checking as automated gates (not manual approval)\n- **TDD Workflow**: Test-first development with red-green-refactor cycle\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Start an SDLC workflow\n/sdlc \"Add user authentication with JWT tokens\"\n\n# Check status\n/sdlc-status\n\n# Cancel workflow (if needed)\n/sdlc-cancel\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Architect Agent** (Opus): Analyzes requirements, creates Beads with dependencies\n2. **Worktree Manager**: Creates isolated worktrees, spawns async implementer agents\n3. **Implementer Agents** (Sonnet): TDD implementation in parallel worktrees\n4. **Reviewer Agent**: Final code review before merge\n\n## Components\n\n### Commands\n- `/sdlc <description>` - Start autonomous workflow\n- `/sdlc-status` - Check workflow progress\n- `/sdlc-cancel` - Cancel active workflow\n\n### Agents\n- `architect` - Opus model, creates feature breakdown with Beads\n- `implementer` - Sonnet model, TDD in isolated worktree\n- `worktree-manager` - Orchestrates parallel worktrees\n- `reviewer` - Final code review\n\n### Skills\n- `beads-workflow` - Beads commands for SDLC\n- `verification-stack` - Full verification pipeline\n- `tdd-workflow` - Test-driven development process\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code v2.1.0+\n- Git (for worktrees)\n- Beads CLI (`bd` command)\n- Project with test infrastructure\n\n## Verification Stack\n\nThe plugin uses verification as automation gates:\n\n```\nTests (pytest/jest/etc) → Lint (ruff/eslint) → Types (mypy/tsc) → Build\n```\n\nIf any gate fails, the agent fixes it before proceeding. No manual approval required.\n"
