Run lint checks\n2. Stage all tracked changes\n3. Create a commit with a concise message\n\n### Create a Pull Request\n```\n/deck:pr\n```\nThis will:\n1. Check if on `main` branch (creates new branch if needed)\n2. Run lint checks\n3. Commit changes\n4. Push to remote\n5. Create PR using `gh` CLI with Conventional Commits format\n\n### Save a Plan\n```\n/deck:plan\n```\nSaves your proposal to a `PLAN-*.md` file in the `./plans` folder.\n\n### Pick up a task\n```\n/deck:pickup plans/PLAN-feature.md\n```\nReads the specified task file and applies it to the current project.\n\n### Refine a Spec\n```\n/deck:spec @docs/SPEC-feature.md\n```\nInterviews you in-depth about your spec using AskUserQuestion tool:\n- Technical implementation details\n- UI & UX considerations\n- Edge cases, tradeoffs, and risks\n\nContinue until the spec is complete, then writes the refined spec back to the file.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)\n- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) - for PR creation\n\n## Credits\n\n- The `/deck:spec` skill is inspired by [@trq212](https://x.com/trq212)'s [tweet](https://x.com/trq212/status/2005315275026260309) on spec-based development workflow with Claude Code.\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n",
