        "README.md": "# Juggle - CLI Ralph Loops with Good UX\n\nRun Ralph Loops while throwing in further tasks; no need to stop the loop or edit JSON.\n\n- Define tasks with acceptance criteria, priority, model size, ...\n- Let agents execute autonomously\n- Manage work via TUI while they run.\n\n**See also:** [Agent Skill](#agent-skill) for teaching your AI the Juggle CLI | [Worktrees](#parallel-agents-with-worktrees) for parallel loops | [Full docs](docs/)\n\n## Why Juggle?\n\nThe [Ralph Loop](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) is powerful but raw -\na bash script watching a prd.json file. Editing tasks while the loop runs\nmeans fighting the agent for file writes. No priority ordering. No way to\nrefine tasks without stopping everything or risking multiple writes.\n\nJuggle adds the missing structure:\n\n- **Edit while running** - TUI file-watches, agent uses CLI; no conflicts\n- **Manage the loop** - reorder, prioritize, group tasks into sessions\n- **Never run dry** - keep feeding refined tasks so the agent always has work\n- **Multiple modes** - headless batch, interactive hand-holding, agent-assisted\n  refinement - all in separate terminals, all on the same task list\n\n**TUI Main View** - Sessions on the left, balls (tasks) on the right, activity log at bottom:\n\n![TUI Main Menu](assets/tui-main-menu.png)\n\n**Task Creation** - Define context, acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies:\n\n![Create New Ball](assets/tui-create-new-ball.png)\n\n**Parallel Agent Loops** - Multiple agents running simultaneously with live feedback:\n\n![Agent Loops Running](assets/loop-running-with-feedback.png)\n\n---\n\nThe feedback from the Agent running in the loop is a bit raw, but it gets the job done.\nFurther work will be done to improve it from this early version.\n\nThe important part is that it _works_.\n\n- Tasks remain isolated per repo - edit and update them while the loop runs without conflicts.\n- Quick shortcuts to run loops, run refinement for your tasks, run interactive sessions for hand-holding the Agent.\n\nAfter you're running multiple loops using worktrees in your main repo... then you're truly succeeding at Agentic Development.\n\n## Built With Itself\n\n<!--\nCommit stats generated with:\njj log --no-graph -r 'ancestors(@)' -T 'committer.timestamp() ++ \"\\n\"' | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -k2\n\nOutput on 2026-01-16:\n     44 2026-01-10\n      6 2026-01-11\n     92 2026-01-12\n     22 2026-01-13\n     66 2026-01-14\n     10 2026-01-15\n     25 2026-01-16\n(plus 7 earlier commits from Oct/Nov 2025 initial setup)\n-->\n\nJuggle was built using juggle - after the first few clunky Ralph Loops with bash scripts, there was something working enough to bootstrap itself.\n\nHere's the commit activity from the first week of development:\n\n```\nJan 10  ████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  44\nJan 11  ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   6\nJan 12  ████████████████████████████████████████████████████  92\nJan 13  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  22\nJan 14  █████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  66\nJan 15  █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  10\nJan 16  ██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  25\n        ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n        265 commits in 7 days\n```\n\nThe workflow was simple:\n\n- Add a task (`juggle plan`) with good ACs (Acceptance Criteria) until I had enough\n- Interactively refine the ACs with an agent (`juggle agent refine`)\n- Run a loop in one tab (`juggle agent run`) and let it work through the tasks\n- View its progress in the TUI (`juggle`) as tasks get marked complete and the commits roll in\n- In the meantime I keep adding more and more tasks... it just keeps going\n\nIn the end I had multiple agents working in parallel on isolated worktrees, each focused on\ndifferent tasks group, all managed through the same TUI and a multiplex terminal (Zellij).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Windows (Scoop)\n\n```bash\nscoop bucket add ohare93 https://github.com/ohare93/scoop && scoop install juggle\n```\n\n### macOS (Homebrew)\n\n```bash\nbrew tap ohare93/tap && brew install juggle\n```\n\n### Linux\n\n**Download and inspect (recommended):**\n\n```bash\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohare93/juggle/main/install.sh\nless install.sh\nchmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh\n```\n\n**Or if you trust the source:**\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohare93/juggle/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n**Or with Go:**\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/ohare93/juggle/cmd/juggle@latest\n```\n\n### Build from Source\n\nSee [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for building from source and additional options.\n\n## Claude Code Setup\n\nJuggle works best with Claude Code's sandbox mode enabled for headless agent loops. Run `juggle init` to configure automatically, or see [Claude Integration](docs/claude-integration.md) for details.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n> **Prerequisite:** You need [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) already set up and authenticated. This is what Juggle will be running, with flags.\n\n### Create a session and add tasks\n\n```bash\ncd ~/your-project\njuggle sessions create my-feature\njuggle tui                        # Add tasks via TUI (recommended)\n```\n\n### Run the agent loop\n\n```bash\njuggle agent run                  # Interactive session selector\njuggle agent run my-feature       # Or specify session directly\n```\n\n### Refine already existing tasks interactively\n\n```bash\njuggle agent refine\njuggle agent refine my-feature\n```\n\n### Manage while it runs\n\nOpen the TUI:\n\n```bash\njuggle                            # Add/edit/reorder tasks live\n```\n\nOr just add / edit / view tasks directly in the terminal:\n\n```bash\njuggle plan\n\njuggle update 162b4eb0 --tags bug-fixes,loop-a\n\n# Large updates for the agent to run during refinement. Users would use the TUI instead\njuggle update cc58e434 --ac \"juggle worktree add <path> registers worktree in main repo config\" \\\n       --ac \"juggle worktree add creates .juggle/link file in worktree pointing to main repo\" \\\n       --ac \"All juggle commands in worktree use main repo's .juggle/ for storage\" \\\n       --ac \"Ball WorkingDir reflects actual worktree path (not main repo)\" \\\n       --ac \"juggle worktree remove <path> unregisters and removes link file\" \\\n       --ac \"juggle worktree list shows registered worktrees\" \\\n       --ac \"Integration tests for worktree registration and ball sharing\" \\\n       --ac \"devbox run test passes\"\n```\n\n## Parallel Agents with Worktrees\n\nEach agent can work in its own isolated worktree/workspace.\n\nWith git/jj it's simple to setup separate workspaces so that multiple agents can work without impacting each other.\nIn juggle we just need to link the two repos to the same juggle project, then they can each run on separate sessions (collections of tasks)\n\nSee [Worktrees (Parallel Agent Loops)](docs/installation.md#worktrees-parallel-agent-loops)\nin the installation guide for setup instructions.\n\n**Workspace management:**\n\n```bash\njuggle worktree run \"devbox run build\"  # Build in all workspaces\njuggle worktree sync                     # Sync local files (e.g. .claude/settings.local.json)\n```\n\n![JJ Commit Log with Worktrees](assets/jj-commit-log-with-3-worktrees.png)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- **More agents** - Support beyond Claude Code (Cursor, Aider, etc.)\n- **TUI-integrated loop** - Run the agent loop inside TUI with live output\n- **Workspace automation** - Automatic git worktree/branch setup per session\n- **Endless mode** - Agent stays running, polling for new tasks when queue empties\n- **Notifications** - Get notified when tasks complete or need attention\n\n## Agent Skill\n\nJuggle includes a skill that teaches AI agents how to manage tasks. Install it so your agent knows the CLI commands, state transitions, and best practices.\n\n**Claude Code:**\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add ohare93/juggle\n/plugin install juggle\n```\n\nOr use `/plugin` for interactive installation.\n\nSee [Agent Skill Setup](docs/installation.md#agent-skill) for other agents and details.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) - Build from source, worktrees, configuration\n- [TUI Guide](docs/tui.md) - Keyboard shortcuts, views, workflows\n- [Commands Reference](docs/commands.md) - Full CLI documentation\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
