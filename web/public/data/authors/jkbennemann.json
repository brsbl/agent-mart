        "skills/1on1-prep/SKILL.md": "---\nname: 1on1-prep\ndescription: |\n  Help leaders prepare effective 1:1 meetings with their direct reports. Use this skill when asked to:\n  prepare a 1:1 agenda, generate discussion topics, create talking points for a specific person or \n  situation, follow up on previous 1:1s, prepare for difficult 1:1 conversations, or structure \n  career development discussions. The skill provides templates, question banks, and frameworks \n  for different 1:1 types (regular check-ins, career conversations, performance concerns, etc.).\n---\n\n# 1:1 Preparation Skill\n\nA framework for preparing and running effective 1:1 meetings that build trust, support growth, and surface issues early.\n\n## Why 1:1s Matter\n\n1:1s are the most important meeting a manager has. They are:\n- **Their meeting, not yours** — The direct report sets the agenda\n- **About them, not status** — Save project updates for standups\n- **Relationship-building time** — Trust compounds over time\n- **Early warning system** — Problems surface here first\n\n## 1:1 Principles\n\n### 1. Consistency Over Intensity\n- Weekly or biweekly, same time, never cancel\n- 30 minutes minimum, 45-60 ideal\n- Rescheduling is okay; canceling erodes trust\n\n### 2. They Own the Agenda\n- Ask them to bring topics\n- Your items come second\n- If they have nothing, dig deeper (that's a signal)\n\n### 3. Listen More Than Talk\n- Aim for 70/30 ratio (them/you)\n- Ask follow-up questions\n- Silence is okay—let them think\n\n### 4. Document and Follow Through\n- Take notes (or have them take notes)\n- Track action items\n- Start next 1:1 with previous action items\n\n---\n\n## 1:1 Types & Templates\n\n### Type 1: Regular Check-in (Weekly/Biweekly)\n\n**Purpose:** Maintain connection, surface small issues before they grow\n\n**Template:**\n```\n## 1:1 with [Name] — [Date]\n\n### Their Topics (5-15 min)\n- [Let them lead]\n\n### How are you doing? (5 min)\n- Energy level / workload\n- Blockers or frustrations\n- Anything I should know?\n\n### Work Check-in (5-10 min)\n- What's going well?\n- What's challenging?\n- Do you have what you need?\n\n### Growth/Development (5 min)\n- Any learning opportunities this week?\n- Skills you want to develop?\n\n### My Topics (5 min)\n- [Your items — keep brief]\n\n### Action Items\n- [ ] ...\n```\n\n---\n\n### Type 2: Career Conversation (Monthly/Quarterly)\n\n**Purpose:** Discuss long-term growth, aspirations, development\n\n**Template:**\n```\n## Career Conversation with [Name] — [Date]\n\n### Reflection\n- What's energized you most in the last quarter?\n- What's drained you?\n- What accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n### Current Role\n- What parts of your job do you love?\n- What would you change if you could?\n- Are you learning and growing?\n\n### Future Direction\n- Where do you see yourself in 1-2 years?\n- What skills do you want to develop?\n- What experiences do you want to have?\n\n### Support Needed\n- How can I help you get there?\n- What opportunities should I look for?\n- What's in your way?\n\n### Action Items\n- [ ] ...\n```\n\n---\n\n### Type 3: Performance Concern\n\n**Purpose:** Address issues early, create clarity on expectations\n\n**Template:**\n```\n## 1:1 with [Name] — [Date] — Performance Discussion\n\n### Opening (be direct)\n\"I want to talk about something important. I care about your \nsuccess here, which is why I'm raising this directly.\"\n\n### The Issue (SBI format)\n- Situation: [When/where]\n- Behavior: [What specifically happened]\n- Impact: [The effect on team/work/customers]\n\n### Their Perspective\n- \"What's your view on this?\"\n- \"What's getting in the way?\"\n- \"Is there context I'm missing?\"\n\n### Expectations Going Forward\n- [Specific, measurable changes needed]\n- [Timeline for improvement]\n- [Support you'll provide]\n\n### Check Understanding\n- \"Can you summarize what we agreed?\"\n- \"What questions do you have?\"\n\n### Action Items\n- [ ] [Specific behavior change]\n- [ ] [Follow-up date]\n- [ ] [Support/resources to provide]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Type 4: New Team Member (First 90 Days)\n\n**Purpose:** Accelerate onboarding, build relationship, identify gaps\n\n**Week 1-2 Focus:**\n```\n- How are you settling in?\n- What's confusing or unclear?\n- Do you have everything you need (access, equipment, etc.)?\n- Who have you met? Who should you meet?\n- What questions do you have about the team/company?\n```\n\n**Week 3-4 Focus:**\n```\n- What's surprised you (good or bad)?\n- What's different from your previous role?\n- Where do you see quick wins?\n- What processes seem inefficient?\n- How's the pace—too fast, too slow?\n```\n\n**Month 2-3 Focus:**\n```\n- Where do you feel confident?\n- Where do you still feel uncertain?\n- What training or support do you need?\n- How's your relationship with the team?\n- What would make you more effective?\n```\n\n---\n\n### Type 5: Returning from Leave / Difficult Period\n\n**Purpose:** Reintegrate thoughtfully, show care\n\n**Template:**\n```\n- Welcome back. How are you really doing?\n- What do you need from me right now?\n- What pace feels right for ramping back up?\n- What should I know but not share with others?\n- How can I protect your time/energy?\n- What's the best way to check in on how you're doing?\n```\n\n---\n\n## Question Bank by Situation\n\n### When They Seem Disengaged\n- \"You've seemed quieter lately. What's on your mind?\"\n- \"On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about your work right now?\"\n- \"What would need to change for this to be a 10?\"\n- \"Are you getting to do what you do best every day?\"\n- \"Is there something outside of work affecting you?\"\n\n### When They're Frustrated\n- \"Tell me more about that frustration.\"\n- \"What's the root cause?\"\n- \"What have you tried so far?\"\n- \"What would need to change?\"\n- \"How can I help—do you want me to fix it, or just listen?\"\n\n### When They Want Promotion\n- \"What does that next level look like to you?\"\n- \"What gaps do you see between where you are and where you want to be?\"\n- \"What evidence would show you're ready?\"\n- \"What can you start doing now at that level?\"\n- \"How can I help you get there?\"\n\n### When They're Overloaded\n- \"Walk me through everything on your plate right now.\"\n- \"What would you take off if you could?\"\n- \"What's urgent vs. important?\"\n- \"What can I take off your plate or delegate elsewhere?\"\n- \"Are you comfortable pushing back when asked to do more?\"\n\n### When There's Team Conflict\n- \"Help me understand what's happening with [person].\"\n- \"What's your role in this dynamic?\"\n- \"What have you tried to resolve it?\"\n- \"What outcome would you like to see?\"\n- \"Would it help if I facilitated a conversation?\"\n\n### When They're a Top Performer\n- \"What's keeping you here?\"\n- \"What might make you leave?\"\n- \"Are you being challenged enough?\"\n- \"What's the most interesting problem you'd want to work on?\"\n- \"How can I help you have more impact?\"\n\n### When They're Quiet / Give One-Word Answers\n- \"If you had a magic wand, what would you change?\"\n- \"What's the one thing you wish I understood better?\"\n- \"What feedback do you have for me?\"\n- \"What's something you've wanted to say but haven't?\"\n- [Try walking 1:1s or informal coffee chats]\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask Every 1:1\n\nPick 1-2 from this list to keep conversation flowing:\n\n### Opening\n- \"What's top of mind for you?\"\n- \"What would make this a great week?\"\n- \"What's one thing you're excited about?\"\n\n### Middle\n- \"What's your biggest challenge right now?\"\n- \"What do you need from me?\"\n- \"Is there anything blocking you?\"\n\n### Closing\n- \"Is there anything we didn't cover?\"\n- \"What's one thing I can do to support you this week?\"\n- \"Anything else on your mind?\"\n\n---\n\n## Manager Self-Check\n\nBefore each 1:1, ask yourself:\n\n| ✓ | Question |\n|---|----------|\n| ☐ | Did I review notes from last 1:1? |\n| ☐ | Did I follow through on my action items? |\n| ☐ | Do I know what they're working on? |\n| ☐ | Is there feedback I've been avoiding? |\n| ☐ | Have I thought about their career lately? |\n| ☐ | Am I in the right headspace to listen? |\n\n---\n\n## Getting Feedback on Yourself\n\nAsk regularly (not every 1:1, but quarterly):\n\n- \"What's one thing I could do differently to support you better?\"\n- \"What am I not seeing that I should be aware of?\"\n- \"If you were in my shoes, what would you do differently?\"\n- \"What should I start doing, stop doing, or keep doing?\"\n- \"On a scale of 1-10, how well am I supporting you? What would make it higher?\"\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags to Watch For\n\n| Signal | What It Might Mean |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Always says \"everything's fine\" | Doesn't feel safe being honest |\n| Never brings topics | Disengaged or doesn't see value |\n| Frequently reschedules | Avoiding something |\n| Only talks about tasks | Keeping you at distance |\n| Sudden mood/behavior change | Personal issue or job searching |\n| Stops asking questions | Checked out |\n| Complains about same thing repeatedly | Feels unheard |\n\n---\n\n## 1:1 Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n❌ **Status meeting** — \"Give me an update on your projects\"\n❌ **Your meeting** — You talk the whole time\n❌ **Skipping regularly** — \"We'll catch up next week\"\n❌ **No notes** — Forgetting what you discussed\n❌ **No follow-through** — Not doing what you said you'd do\n❌ **Only when there's a problem** — Makes 1:1s feel like trouble\n❌ **Multitasking** — Checking Slack/email during meeting\n❌ **Rushing** — Ending early when they clearly have more\n\n---\n\n## Running the 1:1\n\n### First 2 Minutes\n- Warm up: \"How are you? How was your weekend?\"\n- Transition: \"What would you like to talk about today?\"\n\n### Their Agenda (First Half)\n- Listen actively\n- Ask follow-up questions\n- Take notes\n- Don't jump to solutions immediately\n\n### Your Items (Second Half)\n- Keep brief\n- Most important items only\n- Leave time for their reactions\n\n### Last 5 Minutes\n- Summarize key points\n- Confirm action items (who does what by when)\n- \"Anything else before we wrap?\"\n\n---\n\n## After the 1:1\n\n1. **Document** — Update your notes within 24 hours\n2. **Act** — Do your action items promptly\n3. **Follow up** — If something urgent came up, check in before next 1:1\n4. **Reflect** — Did you learn something? Adjust?\n\n---\n\n*Remember: The best 1:1s feel like conversations, not meetings.*\n",

The skill helps balance caring personally while challenging directly.\n---\n\n# Radical Candor Feedback Skill\n\nA framework for giving feedback that is kind, clear, specific, and sincere—helping people improve while showing you genuinely care about them.\n\n## The Radical Candor Framework\n\nRadical Candor sits at the intersection of two dimensions:\n\n```\n                    CARE PERSONALLY\n                          ↑\n                          |\n     Ruinous          |          Radical\n     Empathy          |          Candor\n    \"Nice but         |        \"Kind and\n     unhelpful\"       |         clear\"\n                      |\n   ←------------------+------------------→ CHALLENGE DIRECTLY\n                      |\n     Manipulative     |          Obnoxious\n     Insincerity      |          Aggression\n    \"Passive          |        \"Brutal\n     aggressive\"      |         honesty\"\n                      |\n                          ↓\n```\n\n### The Four Quadrants\n\n| Quadrant | Care | Challenge | Result |\n|----------|------|-----------|--------|\n| **Radical Candor** | High | High | Growth and trust |\n| **Ruinous Empathy** | High | Low | Stagnation, surprises at reviews |\n| **Obnoxious Aggression** | Low | High | Fear, defensiveness |\n| **Manipulative Insincerity** | Low | Low | Politics, backstabbing |\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Be Humble\n- You might be wrong\n- State your perspective, not absolute truth\n- Use \"I noticed...\" not \"You always...\"\n\n### 2. Be Helpful\n- Your goal is their success, not venting\n- Focus on behaviors they can change\n- Offer support, not just criticism\n\n### 3. Be Immediate\n- Give feedback within 2-3 days of the event\n- Context is fresh for both parties\n- Small corrections prevent big problems\n\n### 4. Be In Person (or Synchronous)\n- Praise in public, criticize in private\n- Allow for dialogue and questions\n- Read body language and adjust\n\n### 5. Be Specific\n- Describe the situation clearly\n- Explain the behavior observed\n- Share the impact it had\n\n## Feedback Formula: SBI-I\n\nUse this structure for clear, actionable feedback:\n\n### **S**ituation\nWhen and where did this happen?\n> \"In yesterday's sprint review...\"\n\n### **B**ehavior\nWhat specific, observable action occurred?\n> \"...you interrupted Maria three times while she was presenting...\"\n\n### **I**mpact\nWhat was the effect on you, the team, or the work?\n> \"...which made it hard for her to finish her points and I noticed the team seemed uncomfortable.\"\n\n### **I**ntention (for Radical Candor)\nShow you care and invite dialogue:\n> \"I know you're passionate about this project, and I want to help you contribute effectively. Can we talk about what was going on for you?\"\n\n## Templates\n\n### Praise (Radical Candor Style)\n```\nI wanted to share something I noticed.\n\n[Situation]: During [specific event/time]...\n[Behavior]: You [specific action they took]...\n[Impact]: This resulted in [positive outcome]...\n\nI really appreciate this because [why it matters]. \nKeep doing this—it makes a real difference.\n```\n\n### Constructive Feedback\n```\nI care about your growth, so I want to share some feedback.\n\n[Situation]: In [specific context]...\n[Behavior]: I observed that [specific behavior]...\n[Impact]: The effect was [concrete impact]...\n\nI believe you can [positive framing of change]. \nWhat's your perspective on this? How can I support you?\n```\n\n### Difficult Conversation Opener\n```\nI need to talk with you about something that's been on my mind. \nI'm sharing this because I care about you and your success here.\n\n[Direct statement of the issue]\n\nI want to understand your perspective. Can you help me see \nwhat's happening from your side?\n```\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Missing Deadlines\n**Ruinous Empathy (avoid):** \"Don't worry about the deadline, I know you're busy.\"\n\n**Radical Candor:** \"I noticed the API migration is a week behind schedule. I know you've had a lot on your plate with the production incidents. I'm concerned because this blocks the frontend team. What's getting in the way, and how can I help you get back on track?\"\n\n### Scenario 2: Great Work\n**Manipulative Insincerity (avoid):** \"Good job.\" (vague, feels hollow)\n\n**Radical Candor:** \"Your documentation for the new deployment process was excellent. The step-by-step troubleshooting section specifically helped two team members resolve issues independently this week. This is exactly the kind of knowledge sharing that makes our team stronger.\"\n\n### Scenario 3: Interpersonal Conflict\n**Obnoxious Aggression (avoid):** \"You need to stop being difficult in meetings.\"\n\n**Radical Candor:** \"I've noticed tension between you and Alex in our planning sessions. In Monday's meeting, when you said his estimate was 'completely unrealistic,' he shut down for the rest of the session. I value your technical judgment, and I want you both to succeed. Can we talk about what's driving this friction?\"\n\n### Scenario 4: Performance Concerns\n**Ruinous Empathy (avoid):** Saying nothing until the annual review, then surprising them.\n\n**Radical Candor:** \"I want to have an honest conversation about your performance over the last quarter. I've noticed [specific patterns]. I should have raised this sooner—that's on me. I believe you can turn this around, and here's what I think needs to change. What support do you need from me?\"\n\n## Receiving Feedback\n\nWhen someone gives YOU feedback, model good behavior:\n\n1. **Listen fully** - Don't interrupt or defend\n2. **Thank them** - \"Thank you for telling me this\"\n3. **Clarify** - \"Can you give me a specific example?\"\n4. **Reflect** - \"Let me think about this\"\n5. **Follow up** - Circle back after you've processed it\n\n## Red Flags to Avoid\n\n❌ Starting with \"Don't take this personally...\"\n❌ Using \"but\" after praise (negates the praise)\n❌ Feedback sandwiches (praise-criticism-praise)\n❌ Saying \"everyone thinks...\" (speak for yourself)\n❌ Bringing up old issues alongside new ones\n❌ Giving feedback when you're angry\n❌ Making it about personality, not behavior\n❌ Not offering to help or follow up\n\n## Green Flags to Include\n\n✅ \"I\" statements about your observations\n✅ Specific, recent examples\n✅ Asking for their perspective\n✅ Offering concrete support\n✅ Scheduling follow-up\n✅ Acknowledging what they do well\n✅ Expressing confidence in their ability to improve\n\n## Quick Reference Card\n\nBefore giving feedback, ask yourself:\n\n1. **Do I care?** Am I doing this for them or for me?\n2. **Am I being direct?** Would they know exactly what to change?\n3. **Am I being specific?** Can I point to a concrete example?\n4. **Am I being timely?** Is this still relevant and fresh?\n5. **Am I being humble?** Am I open to being wrong?\n6. **Am I offering help?** What support can I provide?\n\n## 1:1 Integration\n\nUse these prompts in regular 1:1s to build a feedback culture:\n\n- \"What feedback do you have for me?\"\n- \"Is there anything I could do differently to support you better?\"\n- \"What's one thing you'd like me to start, stop, or continue doing?\"\n- \"I have some feedback for you—is now a good time?\"\n\n---\n\n*Based on \"Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity\" by Kim Scott*\n",
        "skills/radical-candor/references/cross-functional-scenarios.md": "# Cross-Functional Scenarios: Radical Candor for All Teams\n\nPractical examples for Support, Sales, Marketing, HR/People, and Finance leaders.\n\n---\n\n## Customer Support\n\n### Empathy Without Resolution\n\n**Context:** A support agent is very friendly with customers but takes too long to resolve tickets and often escalates unnecessarily.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> \"Customers love talking to you!\" \n> *(Ignoring the resolution time and escalation issues)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about your support metrics. Customers rate you 4.8 on friendliness—that's fantastic and genuinely rare. But your average resolution time is 45 minutes versus the team's 20 minutes, and you escalate 40% of tickets that other agents resolve themselves. I think you're spending too much time on rapport and not enough driving toward solutions. Your empathy is a strength—now let's pair it with efficiency. Can we review some of your recent tickets together and practice faster paths to resolution?\"\n\n---\n\n### Burned Out Agent Getting Snippy\n\n**Context:** A normally excellent support agent has started giving curt, borderline rude responses.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I need to share some feedback from this week. I reviewed your ticket responses and noticed a different tone. When the customer asked about refund policies, you wrote 'As stated in our FAQ, which you could have read...' That's not like you. Last month you would have kindly linked them and offered to help further. I'm not here to criticize—I'm concerned. Are you okay? Is the workload too much? Let's figure out what's going on before it affects more customers or your reputation on the team.\"\n\n---\n\n### Not Following the Script When They Should\n\n**Context:** An agent improvises on compliance-related responses where exact wording matters.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I reviewed your GDPR data deletion responses and found you're paraphrasing instead of using our approved templates. I know the templates feel robotic, and your instinct to personalize is usually great. But for legal compliance, the exact wording matters—our legal team crafted it specifically. Last week's improvised response actually missed a required disclosure. For these specific ticket types, I need you to use the templates verbatim. For everything else, keep personalizing. Does that distinction make sense?\"\n\n---\n\n### Support Lead Not Developing Team\n\n**Context:** A support team lead handles escalations themselves instead of coaching agents.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"You're incredible at handling difficult customers—your de-escalation on the Werner account saved us €15K in potential churn. But I've noticed you take over escalations instead of coaching agents through them. In the last month, you handled 23 escalations yourself. That's not scalable, and it's not growing the team. Your job is to make yourself less needed, not more. Next escalation, I want you to sit with the agent and guide them through it instead of taking over. Can we try that?\"\n\n---\n\n## Sales\n\n### Overpromising to Close Deals\n\n**Context:** A salesperson promises features or timelines that the product/engineering team can't deliver.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> \"Great job closing that deal!\" \n> *(Ignoring the mess they've created for delivery)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"We need to talk about the Müller Agentur deal. You closed €30K ARR—well done on the relationship building. But you promised a custom WordPress multisite feature by March that our product roadmap doesn't include until Q4, if at all. Now the customer expects it, and I have to either disappoint them or pressure engineering to derail their priorities. This has happened three times this quarter. I need you to check with product before promising anything not on our current feature list. Your closing skills are strong—let's make sure we can actually deliver what you sell.\"\n\n---\n\n### Not Updating CRM\n\n**Context:** A top performer doesn't log activities or update deal stages in the CRM.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"You're on track to be our top closer this quarter—your conversion rate is 15% above team average. But your CRM hygiene is a real problem. You have 12 deals with no activity logged in 3 weeks, and I have no visibility into your pipeline. When I asked for a forecast yesterday, I had to guess. This isn't just admin work—it affects our revenue planning and my ability to support you. I need every deal updated weekly, notes on every call. What's getting in the way of doing this? Is it the mobile app? Time? Let's solve it.\"\n\n---\n\n### Avoiding Difficult Prospects\n\n**Context:** A salesperson cherry-picks easy leads and avoids challenging enterprise prospects.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've been looking at your lead distribution. You've closed 8 deals this quarter, all SMB accounts under €5K. But you've let 6 enterprise leads go cold without a single follow-up. I think you're avoiding the harder conversations. Enterprise sales is different—longer cycles, more stakeholders—but that's where your growth is. I'm not going to let you stay comfortable in SMB forever. Let's pick two of those enterprise leads and work them together. I'll join your first calls if that helps.\"\n\n---\n\n### Discounting Too Quickly\n\n**Context:** A salesperson defaults to offering discounts at the first sign of price resistance.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I reviewed your closed deals this month. You gave discounts on 7 of 9 deals, averaging 18% off. You left roughly €8K on the table. When I listened to the Bauer call, you offered 15% off the moment they said 'that's a bit more than we budgeted.' They hadn't even pushed back hard yet. I know you want to close, but discounting is a last resort, not an opener. Let's roleplay some price objection scenarios. I want you to practice holding the line and selling value before reaching for the discount lever.\"\n\n---\n\n## Marketing\n\n### Beautiful Campaigns, No Metrics\n\n**Context:** A marketer creates visually stunning work but can't connect it to business results.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> \"The campaign looks amazing!\" \n> *(Never asking about ROI)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"The Black Friday campaign visuals were genuinely impressive—best creative we've produced. But when I asked about results, you showed me impressions and likes. I need to know: How many leads? What was the cost per acquisition? How did it compare to last year? I can't justify your budget to leadership with 'it looked great.' Going forward, every campaign needs a measurement plan before launch. I want to protect your creative freedom, but I need you to prove impact. Can we build a simple dashboard together?\"\n\n---\n\n### Content Creator Missing Deadlines\n\n**Context:** A content writer consistently delivers late, disrupting the editorial calendar.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"We need to talk about deadlines. The product launch blog post was due Monday for a Wednesday publish. You delivered Thursday. This is the fourth time in two months. Each delay cascades—design can't create graphics, social can't schedule posts, and the launch loses momentum. I know you care about quality, but right now your perfectionism is hurting the team. I need you to hit deadlines even if the draft isn't perfect—we can edit together. If deadlines are unrealistic, tell me earlier so we can adjust. What's really going on?\"\n\n---\n\n### Marketing-Sales Misalignment\n\n**Context:** A marketing manager dismisses sales feedback about lead quality.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've noticed a pattern in how you respond to sales feedback. When Thomas said the webinar leads weren't converting, you said 'sales just needs to follow up faster.' When Anna questioned the ICP targeting, you defended the campaign metrics. I get it—it feels like an attack on your work. But marketing and sales have to be partners. The data shows our MQL-to-SQL conversion dropped 30% this quarter. Let's set up a joint session to actually listen to what sales is experiencing. Your campaigns are strong—but we need to tune them to what actually closes.\"\n\n---\n\n### Social Media Tone Misfire\n\n**Context:** A social media manager's casual tone crossed a line into unprofessional territory.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I need to give you feedback on yesterday's LinkedIn post. The meme about 'when your hosting crashes' landed wrong with some customers who actually experienced downtime last month. We got three complaints. I love that you've made our social presence more human and engaging—our engagement is up 40%. But there's a line between relatable and insensitive. For anything touching on service issues or customer pain points, run it by me first. For everything else, keep being creative. Fair?\"\n\n---\n\n## HR / People\n\n### Avoiding Performance Conversations\n\n**Context:** An HR business partner avoids coaching managers on difficult performance conversations.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> *(HR defers to managers: \"That's really their call...\")*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've noticed you tend to step back when managers need to have tough performance conversations. With the situation on the support team, the manager asked for your help three times, and each time you sent templates but didn't offer to coach or sit in. Part of your role is building manager capability in difficult conversations—not just providing documents. I know it's uncomfortable, but avoidance doesn't serve anyone. Let's roleplay the conversation together, then you coach the manager through it. I'll support you.\"\n\n---\n\n### HR Not Maintaining Confidentiality Perception\n\n**Context:** An HR team member is seen chatting casually with certain employees, creating perception of favoritism or leaked information.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about something perception-related. You've become good friends with a few people in marketing, which is natural. But I've heard concerns from other employees that 'HR is closer to some teams than others.' When you had coffee with Lisa right after her manager's feedback meeting, people noticed. I'm not saying you shared anything, but in HR, perception matters as much as reality. We need to be seen as neutral. Can you be more mindful about timing and visibility of social interactions, especially around sensitive events?\"\n\n---\n\n### Recruiter Overselling Roles\n\n**Context:** A recruiter hypes up roles to candidates, leading to early turnover when reality doesn't match.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I looked at your hiring cohort from Q2. Four of the seven hires have already left or are on PIPs. When I did exit interviews, two mentioned the job 'wasn't what was described.' You're great at selling the opportunity and getting candidates excited—your offer acceptance rate is excellent. But we have a retention problem. I need you to be more honest about challenges: the legacy codebase, the fast pace, the ambiguity. Better to lose a candidate in the process than lose an employee in month three. Let's review your pitch together.\"\n\n---\n\n### Not Addressing Toxic High Performer\n\n**Context:** HR is aware of a high performer's toxic behavior but avoids addressing it because 'they deliver results.'\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about the situation with [person]. I know they hit 150% of target, but I've received four complaints about their behavior this quarter—yelling in meetings, dismissive emails, taking credit for team work. We've documented it but taken no action. I understand the business pressure to keep top performers, but we're losing good people who don't want to work with them. Tolerating this signals our values are negotiable. I need you to partner with their manager on a formal conversation this week. What support do you need?\"\n\n---\n\n## Accounting / Finance\n\n### Accountant Making Errors Under Pressure\n\n**Context:** Month-end reports have had recurring errors that require corrections.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> \"Month-end is stressful for everyone, don't worry about it.\"\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I need to discuss the month-end accuracy issues. The last three closes have each required corrections—wrong cost center allocations, a duplicate entry, and the VAT miscalculation. I know you're under time pressure, but these errors cost us hours of rework and affect leadership's trust in our numbers. I'm not questioning your capability—you did clean closes for six months before this. What changed? Is the workload too high? Do you need a review buddy? Let's fix the process, not just the symptoms.\"\n\n---\n\n### Finance Business Partner Not Challenging Budgets\n\n**Context:** A finance partner rubber-stamps department budgets without pushback or analysis.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I reviewed how you handled the marketing budget request. They asked for a 40% increase, you asked a few questions, and approved it within a day. When I dug in, I found €50K allocated to channels we've never measured ROI on. Your role isn't just to process requests—it's to be a strategic partner who challenges assumptions. Marketing should have had to justify that spend. I need you to push back respectfully, ask harder questions, and protect the company's resources. Let's review the next budget request together so I can show you what I mean.\"\n\n---\n\n### Blaming Other Departments\n\n**Context:** An accountant consistently blames late reports on other departments without owning their part.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"When leadership asked why the cash flow report was late, you said 'Sales didn't submit their numbers on time.' That may be true, but I noticed you didn't follow up with sales until the deadline had passed. Part of your job is chasing inputs proactively, not waiting and then blaming. I've seen this pattern three months in a row. Own the outcome, not just your piece of it. Next month, I want you to set earlier deadlines with departments and escalate to me on day one if anyone's late. Can you do that?\"\n\n---\n\n### Resistant to New Systems\n\n**Context:** A senior accountant resists adopting new financial software, sticking to old methods.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about the new expense management system. The team has been using it for two months, but I notice you're still doing manual reconciliation in Excel and then entering into the system after. That's double work, and it defeats the purpose of the automation. I understand the old way feels safer—you've done it for years. But I need you to fully adopt the new process. Let's schedule training time this week. If there are legitimate gaps in the system, I want to hear them so we can fix them. But 'I prefer the old way' isn't enough.\"\n\n---\n\n### Finance Creating Unnecessary Friction\n\n**Context:** The finance team is seen as 'the department of no' that blocks initiatives.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've gotten feedback from three department heads that working with our team feels adversarial. When product asked about the new tool budget, the response was 'denied, over budget'—no explanation, no alternatives. We have a reputation as blockers, not partners. I know our job is to protect the budget, but how we do it matters. I want us to be known as the team that finds a way, not the team that says no. When you deny a request, I need you to explain why and offer alternatives. Let's draft some response templates together.\"\n\n---\n\n## General Leadership Scenarios (All Functions)\n\n### The \"That's Not My Job\" Employee\n\n**Context:** Someone strictly interprets their role and refuses tasks slightly outside their job description.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've noticed a pattern I want to discuss. When Maria asked you to help with the customer presentation, you said it wasn't in your job description. When the team needed someone to cover a handoff meeting, you declined for the same reason. I understand wanting clear boundaries, but rigid role definitions hurt team flexibility and your own growth. I'm not asking you to do someone else's job permanently—I'm asking you to be a team player in moments that matter. How can we find a balance you're comfortable with?\"\n\n---\n\n### The Brilliant Jerk\n\n**Context:** A top performer is technically excellent but damages team morale.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"We need to have a serious conversation. Your work quality is exceptional—the audit prep you did was the best I've seen. But I've received multiple complaints about how you treat colleagues. Last week you called Thomas's analysis 'amateur hour' in front of the team. I've seen two good people transfer out of our department citing your behavior. Your brilliance doesn't give you license to demean others. This needs to change immediately. I want to help you succeed here, but not at the cost of everyone else. What's driving this behavior?\"\n\n---\n\n### The Over-Helper Burning Out\n\n**Context:** Someone says yes to everything, works late constantly, and is heading toward burnout.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I need to talk to you about something I've observed. You've said yes to every request this quarter—the extra reports, covering for Jan, joining the new project. You're online until 10 PM most nights. I appreciate your dedication, but I'm worried. This pace isn't sustainable, and I don't want to lose you to burnout. Part of professional growth is learning to say no and protect your capacity. I'm giving you permission—actually, I'm requiring you—to push back on non-essential requests. Let's look at your workload together and cut 20%.\"\n\n---\n\n### The Meeting Dominator (Non-Technical)\n\n**Context:** Someone talks too much in meetings, especially over more junior colleagues.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to share an observation from our team meetings. You have valuable experience, and when you speak, it's usually insightful. But I timed it in yesterday's meeting—you spoke for 18 of the 30 minutes. I noticed Anna and Peter tried to contribute but couldn't find openings. I need you to create more space. Here's a challenge: in our next meeting, try speaking only after two other people have contributed. I think you'll find that your comments land with more impact when they're less frequent.\"\n\n---\n\n### Not Giving You Feedback\n\n**Context:** A direct report never gives you (their manager) upward feedback.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to ask you something directly. I ask for feedback in every 1:1, and you always say 'everything's fine.' I don't believe that's possible—I'm sure there are things I could do better. When you don't give me feedback, I can't improve, and I worry you might not feel safe being honest with me. Is there something I'm doing that makes it hard to speak up? I genuinely want to hear it. Even small things. Especially the uncomfortable things.\"\n\n---\n\n## Praise Examples (All Functions)\n\n### Support\n> \"I listened to your call with the angry customer about the billing error. You let them vent, acknowledged their frustration without being defensive, and solved the problem in under 10 minutes. They went from threatening to cancel to saying 'you've restored my faith in this company.' That's a textbook de-escalation. I'm sharing this call as a training example.\"\n\n### Sales\n> \"I want to recognize how you handled the Schneider objection yesterday. When they pushed back on price, you didn't flinch or discount immediately. You asked about their priorities, reframed the value around their specific goals, and held the full price. That takes confidence. That deal at full margin is worth more than two discounted ones.\"\n\n### Marketing\n> \"The case study you wrote for Weber GmbH is excellent. You didn't just list features—you told a story with real numbers, real challenges, real outcomes. Sales has already used it to close two similar deals this week. This is exactly the kind of content that proves marketing's revenue impact.\"\n\n### HR\n> \"The way you handled the restructuring communication was masterful. You met with every affected person individually before the announcement, gave managers talking points, and anticipated every FAQ. There was zero gossip spiral and minimal panic. That's HR at its best—invisible when done well, but making everything run smoothly.\"\n\n### Finance\n> \"I want to acknowledge how you approached the budget review with marketing. Instead of just saying no to the increase, you analyzed their channel ROI, identified the underperformers, and proposed reallocating within their existing budget. They left feeling helped, not blocked. That's being a true business partner.\"\n",

In the last three PRs, we've found null pointer issues that made it to staging. Last week's incident cost us 4 hours of debugging. I know you can write solid code—I've seen it. What's happening? Are you feeling rushed? Do you need a refresher on our testing practices? I want to help you get back to the quality I know you're capable of.\"\n\n---\n\n### Senior Engineer Not Mentoring\n\n**Context:** A senior dev does great individual work but doesn't help juniors grow.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> *(Saying nothing because they're a top performer)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to discuss something important for your growth into a Staff role. You're technically excellent—your architecture work on the payments service was outstanding. But I've noticed you tend to take on complex tasks solo rather than pairing with the junior devs. Last sprint, three opportunities for knowledge transfer went to other seniors because you were heads-down. Part of the senior role is multiplying team capability. What's holding you back from mentoring? How can I help make that easier?\"\n\n---\n\n### Over-Engineering\n\n**Context:** A developer keeps building complex solutions when simple ones would work.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to give you some feedback on the caching solution you proposed. You designed a distributed cache with eventual consistency for what's essentially a config lookup that changes once a month. I admire your systems thinking, and that knowledge will be valuable—but right now, we need a simple in-memory cache. I've seen this pattern a few times from you. Can we talk about how to calibrate solution complexity to problem size? This is actually a common growth area for strong engineers.\"\n\n---\n\n## Collaboration & Communication\n\n### Dominating Meetings\n\n**Context:** A team member talks over others and dominates discussions.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I need to share something from today's planning meeting. You spoke for about 60% of the time, and I noticed you cut off both Sarah and Marcus when they tried to contribute. I value your input—you have great insights—but the team needs space to participate too. I've seen quieter team members stop trying to contribute in meetings you're in. Can we work on creating more room for others? Maybe try a rule where you wait for two other people to speak before jumping in again?\"\n\n---\n\n### Remote Team Member Going Silent\n\n**Context:** A remote team member has become less engaged in discussions.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> *(Assuming they're fine and not wanting to pry)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've noticed you've been quieter in our team discussions lately—fewer comments in Slack, camera off in standups. That's different from how engaged you used to be. I'm not sure if something's going on, but I care about how you're doing. Is everything okay? Is there something about how we're working that's not working for you? I want to make sure you feel connected and valued on the team.\"\n\n---\n\n### Taking Credit for Team Work\n\n**Context:** A team member presents team work as their individual achievement.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about the stakeholder presentation yesterday. When you said 'I redesigned the authentication flow,' that was actually a collaboration between you, Anna, and the security team. I know you drove parts of it, but not acknowledging others' contributions can damage trust. Anna mentioned she felt overlooked. Going forward, I need you to use 'we' when presenting team work. How can I help you do that?\"\n\n---\n\n## Growth & Development\n\n### Ambitious But Not Ready\n\n**Context:** Someone wants a promotion but hasn't demonstrated the required skills.\n\n**Ruinous Empathy:**\n> \"You're doing great, keep it up, you'll get there eventually.\"\n> *(Vague, doesn't help them improve)*\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I know you want to move to Senior Engineer, and I want to help you get there. Let me be direct about the gap: Senior Engineers here lead projects end-to-end and mentor others. Right now, you're strong on implementation but haven't yet led a project through ambiguity or coached a junior dev. Here's what I'd suggest: take ownership of the logging refactor project, and start doing weekly pairing sessions with Marcus. Let's check in monthly on progress. I believe you can get there in the next two quarters if you focus on these areas.\"\n\n---\n\n### Coasting After Promotion\n\n**Context:** Someone got promoted and has since stopped pushing themselves.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to have an honest conversation. When you were working toward the promotion, you were shipping features, proposing improvements, mentoring actively. Since the promotion six months ago, I've seen that energy drop. You're meeting expectations, but you used to exceed them. I'm telling you this because I care about your long-term career here. What's going on? Are you burned out? Bored? Not sure what the next challenge is? Let's figure out what will reignite that drive.\"\n\n---\n\n## Difficult Situations\n\n### Body Odor / Hygiene\n\n**Context:** A team member's hygiene is affecting the team but no one wants to say anything.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> *(In private, with genuine care)*\n> \"This is awkward for me to bring up, but I'd want someone to tell me. I've noticed a body odor issue in our recent in-person meetings. I don't know if you're aware of it or if something's going on. I'm only mentioning it because I want you to succeed here, and I don't want this to become something people talk about behind your back. Is there anything I can help with?\"\n\n---\n\n### Personal Issues Affecting Work\n\n**Context:** Someone's work has declined, and you suspect personal issues.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I've noticed a change in your work over the past month—more missed deadlines, less engagement in meetings. This isn't like you. I'm not asking you to share anything personal, but I want you to know I've noticed and I care. If something's going on, I want to support you—whether that's flexible hours, reduced scope temporarily, or just knowing someone's in your corner. What do you need right now?\"\n\n---\n\n### Resisting Feedback\n\n**Context:** Someone gets defensive every time they receive feedback.\n\n**Radical Candor:**\n> \"I want to talk about something meta. When I've given you feedback lately, like about the deployment process last week, I notice you immediately explain why you did it that way or what wasn't your fault. I get it—feedback can feel like criticism. But when you defend right away, it makes me hesitant to share things that could help you grow. Can we try something? Next time I give feedback, just say 'let me think about that' and we can discuss it later. Does that feel doable?\"\n\n---\n\n## Praise Examples\n\n### Public Recognition (Specific)\n\n> \"I want to call out something from last week's incident. When the database went down at 2 AM, Maya took lead on coordination. She set up the war room, kept stakeholders updated every 30 minutes, and documented everything in real-time. The postmortem practically wrote itself. This is exactly the incident leadership we need. Thank you, Maya.\"\n\n### Private Recognition (Growth)\n\n> \"I noticed something in yesterday's architecture review that I wanted to mention. Six months ago, you struggled to present your ideas to skeptical senior engineers. Yesterday, when Chen pushed back on your caching approach, you listened, asked clarifying questions, acknowledged his concern, and then clearly explained your reasoning. He changed his mind. That's a huge growth in technical communication. I'm really impressed.\"\n\n---\n\n## Quick Prompts for 1:1s\n\nUse these to build a feedback culture:\n\n**For receiving feedback:**\n- \"What's one thing I could do differently to make your work easier?\"\n- \"If you were in my role, what would you change?\"\n- \"What am I not seeing that I should be aware of?\"\n\n**For giving feedback:**\n- \"I have some feedback—would now be a good time, or should we schedule it?\"\n- \"Can I share an observation from this week?\"\n- \"There's something I've been meaning to discuss with you...\"\n\n**For encouraging peer feedback:**\n- \"How did the pairing session with Alex go? Any feedback for each other?\"\n- \"What's one thing a teammate did this sprint that helped you?\"\n- \"Is there any friction on the team I should know about?\"\n"
