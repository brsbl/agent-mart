        "README.md": "# team-orchestrator\n\nAI agent team orchestration plugin for Claude Code. Intelligently routes tasks to subagents or agent teams, composes teams from a role pool grounded in management theory, and self-evolves through session reflection.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# 1. Add the marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/labrinyang/team-ochestractor\n\n# 2. Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install team-orchestrator@team-orchestrator-marketplace\n```\n\n**For local development:**\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./team-ochestractor\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nEnable agent teams (required for team patterns):\n```json\n// settings.json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | When to Use |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `orchestrating-work` | Core decision engine: subagent vs agent team routing |\n| `research-and-review` | Parallel investigation with adversarial challenge |\n| `feature-development` | Independent module development in parallel |\n| `competing-hypotheses` | Adversarial debugging with competing theories |\n| `cross-layer-collaboration` | Frontend + backend + test coordination |\n| `session-reflection` | End-of-session learning capture to `.claude.md` |\n\n## Agents (Role Pool)\n\nOrganized by Belbin team role categories:\n\n**Thinking:**\n- `architect` — System design, interface definition (Plant)\n- `reviewer` — Critical evaluation, spec + quality review (Monitor-Evaluator)\n- `researcher` — Deep investigation, evidence gathering (Specialist)\n\n**Action:**\n- `implementer` — Code building, follows contracts (Implementer)\n- `debugger` — Hypothesis-driven root cause analysis (Shaper)\n- `finisher` — Edge cases, tests, polish (Completer-Finisher)\n\n**People:**\n- `coordinator` — Team lead, task delegation, synthesis (Coordinator)\n- `integrator` — Cross-module consistency (Teamworker)\n- `devil-advocate` — Mandatory dissent, assumption challenging (Monitor-Evaluator + Safety)\n\n## Management Theory Foundation\n\n| Rule | Source |\n|------|--------|\n| Validate Thinking/Action/People role coverage | Belbin Team Roles |\n| Enforce stage gates (plan before implement) | Tuckman's Group Development |\n| Verify 5 conditions before launch | Hackman's Team Effectiveness |\n| Reduce scope when behind, never add agents | Brooks' Law |\n| Team structure mirrors desired architecture | Conway's Law |\n| Max 7 agents, default 3-4 | Two-Pizza Rule |\n| Mandatory devil-advocate review | Psychological Safety |\n| Persist retrospective learnings | Agile Retrospectives |\n| Lead manages max 4 direct reports | Span of Control |\n| Every agent has specialty + general context | T-Shaped Skills |\n\n## Self-Evolution\n\nThe plugin learns across sessions:\n\n1. **Session start:** Hook reads `.claude.md` with past lessons\n2. **During work:** Agents follow preventive rules from past sessions\n3. **Session end:** `session-reflection` skill records new learnings\n4. **Second offense:** Repeated mistakes get escalated with stronger rules\n5. **Universal lessons:** Promoted to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` when confirmed across projects\n\n## Decision Framework\n\n```\nTask → Single focused? → Subagent\n     → 2+ independent, no communication? → Parallel subagents\n     → Need inter-agent communication? → Agent Team\n         → Investigation + challenge → research-and-review\n         → Independent modules → feature-development\n         → Competing theories → competing-hypotheses\n         → Frontend + backend + test → cross-layer-collaboration\n```\n\n**Default:** Start with subagents (cheaper). Escalate to teams only when communication adds genuine value.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
