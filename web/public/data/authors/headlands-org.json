        "architect/README.md": "# Architect Plugin\n\nAI Architect & System Orchestrator for managing complex engineering projects with parallel execution, quality gates, and independent code review validation.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin install architect@headlands-plugin-marketplace\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n/architect <your complex engineering goal>\n```\n\n## The 7-Phase Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Deconstruct the Goal\nThe architect breaks down your high-level request into core engineering objectives and restates the mission for confirmation.\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Research & Discovery\n- Formulates specific research questions about your codebase\n- Executes research in parallel using the Task tool\n- Synthesizes findings into a Knowledge Brief\n\n**Example research questions:**\n- \"What is the current data schema for Users?\"\n- \"Which files handle API authentication?\"\n- \"What are the existing testing patterns?\"\n\n### Phase 3: Strategic Execution Plan\nCreates a `PLAN.md` file with:\n- Sequential **Steps**\n- Parallel **Tasks** within each step\n- For each task:\n  - **Goal**: Single clear outcome\n  - **Success Criteria**: Verifiable conditions\n  - **Sandbox**: Allowed files/directories\n  - **Do Not Touch**: Forbidden areas\n\n### Phase 4: Approval & Revisions\n- Analyzes highest-risk areas\n- Summarizes key architectural decisions (API, database, UX changes)\n- Waits for human approval\n- Iterates on plan as needed\n\n### Phase 5: Delegate & Supervise\n- Executes plan step-by-step\n- Launches tasks in parallel within each step\n- **Quality Gate Loop** (critical):\n  - Switches to powerful model for review\n  - Checks output against Success Criteria\n  - Runs tests\n  - Approves or creates fix-it tasks\n  - Never proceeds until all tasks pass\n\n### Phase 6: Independent Validation *(New)*\nAfter implementation completes, spawns an **independent code reviewer** with fresh context:\n\n1. **Discover Guidelines**: Searches for project-specific review criteria (`code-review-guidelines.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.)\n2. **Generate Change Summary**: Creates neutral diff without explaining intent\n3. **Spawn Reviewer**: Launches a fresh task that receives ONLY:\n   - The code diff (no context about goals)\n   - Generic review criteria (security, reliability, quality)\n   - Any discovered project-specific guidelines\n4. **Triage Issues**: Categorizes by severity (P0-P3)\n5. **Fix & Repeat**: Addresses P0/P1 issues, repeats until clean\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Eliminates confirmation bias (reviewer doesn't know intended behavior)\n- Catches issues the implementation-aware architect might rationalize\n- Respects project-specific conventions automatically\n- Maximum 3 cycles before escalating unresolved issues\n\n### Phase 7: Final Integration & Report\n- Performs final integration test\n- Runs project linters/tests\n- Deletes PLAN.md\n- Provides comprehensive report including:\n  - Work completed\n  - Issues found and fixed during validation\n  - Any documented exceptions\n  - Final codebase state\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Ideal for:**\n- Large refactoring projects spanning multiple files\n- Multi-component features requiring coordination\n- Complex migrations (database, API, framework)\n- Projects needing explicit quality checkpoints\n- Work requiring clear scope boundaries\n- Codebases with review guidelines you want enforced\n\n**Not ideal for:**\n- Single-file changes\n- Trivial updates\n- Exploratory coding\n- Quick prototypes\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\n### Database Migration\n```bash\n/architect migrate user authentication from sessions to JWT tokens\n```\n\nThe architect will:\n1. Research current session implementation\n2. Plan migration steps (schema, API, client)\n3. Get your approval on the approach\n4. Execute with quality gates at each phase\n5. Run independent validation to catch security issues\n6. Verify integration tests pass\n\n### Multi-Service Refactoring\n```bash\n/architect extract payment processing into a separate microservice\n```\n\nThe architect will:\n1. Identify all payment-related code\n2. Plan service boundaries and APIs\n3. Review with you before changes\n4. Implement with parallel tasks\n5. Validate changes independently for security/reliability\n6. Test end-to-end integration\n\n## Tips\n\n**Be specific about constraints:**\n```bash\n/architect add real-time notifications, but don't change the database schema\n```\n\n**Provide context:**\n```bash\n/architect implement caching for the API, we're using Redis already\n```\n\n**Set explicit goals:**\n```bash\n/architect reduce API response time by 50% through query optimization\n```\n\n## What Gets Created\n\nDuring execution you'll see:\n- **PLAN.md** - The complete execution plan (deleted after completion)\n- **Task outputs** - Results from parallel research and implementation\n- **Quality reports** - Reviews of each completed task\n- **Validation reports** - Independent review findings and fixes\n- **Final report** - Summary of all work done\n\n## How Review Guidelines Are Discovered\n\nThe validation phase automatically searches for these files (in priority order):\n- `**/code-review-guidelines.md`\n- `**/code-review*.md`\n- `**/review-guidelines*.md`\n- `**/AGENTS.md`\n- `**/CLAUDE.md`\n- `**/CONTRIBUTING.md`\n- `**/CODE_STYLE.md`\n- `**/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE*`\n\nIf found, these are provided to the reviewer alongside generic criteria.\n\n## Configuration\n\nNo configuration needed. The architect uses:\n- Task tool for parallel execution\n- Model switching (Haiku for research, Opus for review/validation)\n- Your existing development tools and test infrastructure\n- Auto-discovered review guidelines\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Requires Task tool access\n- Works best with existing test suites\n- Needs clear success criteria for quality gates\n- Human approval adds time (but prevents mistakes)\n- Validation limited to 3 cycles before escalation\n\n## Support\n\nIssues: https://github.com/headlands-org/plugin-marketplace/issues\nLabel: `plugin:architect`\n",
        "issuify/README.md": "# Issuify Plugin\n\nCreate GitHub issues and pull requests with structured, concise formatting using the GitHub Copilot MCP server.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin install issuify@headlands-plugin-marketplace\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope\n- Active git repository with changes to document\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n/issuify\n```\n\nThe command will:\n1. Review all changed files since upstream branch\n2. Catalog known work from context\n3. Ask about unexpected changes\n4. Create a GitHub issue (what & why)\n5. Create a pull request (how)\n\n## Writing Style\n\nIssuify enforces a **casual but precise** style:\n\n**Good:**\n> \"Auth flow breaks when users spam the login button. Adds debouncing to fix race conditions.\"\n\n**Bad:**\n> \"We have carefully implemented a comprehensive and robust solution to ensure that the authentication flow handles edge cases.\"\n\n**Skip these words:**\n- \"comprehensive\"\n- \"robust\"\n- \"ensure\"\n- \"carefully\"\n- \"enhance\"\n- \"improve\"\n\n## Issue Format\n\n### Problem (1-2 sentences max)\nWhat's broken or missing. Be specific.\n\n### Value (1 sentence)\nWhy it matters. Business impact or user pain.\n\n### Solution (2-3 bullets, not exhaustive)\nWhat we're doing. High-level approach only.\n\n**Target:** 3-5 sentences total\n\n**Example:**\n```\n## Problem\nUser sessions expire mid-checkout, losing cart data. Happens ~5% of the time.\n\n## Value\nWe're losing sales. Cart recovery would increase conversion 3-4%.\n\n## Solution\n- Persist cart to localStorage with 24hr TTL\n- Restore on session recovery\n- Add warning before timeout\n```\n\n## PR Format\n\n### Summary (2-3 bullets max)\nWhat changed. Technical but simple.\n\n### Why (1 sentence)\nHow it solves the issue. Link back to issue.\n\n### Test (2-3 bullets)\nWhat to check. Key verification steps only.\n\n**Target:** 4-6 sentences total\n\n**Example:**\n```\n## Summary\n- Added localStorage persistence for cart state\n- Session recovery checks localStorage before clearing cart\n- Toast warning appears 2min before timeout\n\n## Why\nFixes cart data loss on session expiry (#123)\n\n## Test\n- Add items to cart, wait for session timeout, refresh → cart preserved\n- Verify warning appears at 28min mark\n- Clear localStorage → cart resets as expected\n```\n\n## GitHub Integration\n\nUses the **GitHub Copilot MCP server** tools:\n\n- `mcp__github__create_issue` - Creates the issue\n- `mcp__github__create_pull_request` - Creates the PR\n\nThe plugin automatically:\n- Detects repository and branch context\n- Links PR to issue\n- Formats according to style guide\n- Handles authentication via MCP\n\n## Examples\n\n### Feature Addition\n```bash\n/issuify\n```\n\n**Generated issue:**\n> **Problem:** No way to filter search results by date. Users scroll through hundreds of old results.\n>\n> **Value:** Top user request. Would improve search UX significantly.\n>\n> **Solution:**\n> - Add date range picker to search UI\n> - Filter results in backend query\n> - Persist filter state in URL params\n\n### Bug Fix\n```bash\n/issuify\n```\n\n**Generated issue:**\n> **Problem:** File upload fails for images >5MB. Error handling shows generic message.\n>\n> **Value:** Blocks users from uploading high-res images. Support tickets spiking.\n>\n> **Solution:**\n> - Increase limit to 25MB\n> - Add client-side size check with clear error\n> - Compress images if needed\n\n## Tips\n\n**Let issuify review diffs:**\nDon't explain what you changed. Let the command analyze your git diff and generate descriptions.\n\n**Be honest about unexpected changes:**\nIf issuify asks about unexpected files, explain truthfully. It helps write better issues.\n\n**Trust the style:**\nThe casual tone feels weird at first but makes issues much faster to read.\n\n**One issue per logical change:**\nIf you have multiple unrelated changes, create separate branches and run `/issuify` for each.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### GitHub Personal Access Token Setup\n\nThe GitHub MCP server requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) because it doesn't support OAuth authentication correctly.\n\n1. Create a GitHub PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens with `repo` scope\n2. Set the environment variable:\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"your_token_here\"\n   ```\n3. Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.) to persist across sessions\n\n### MCP Server Configuration\n\nMCP server configuration (included with plugin):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin will automatically read `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` from your environment.\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\n### Standard Flow\n```bash\n# 1. Make your changes\ngit add .\n\n# 2. Create issue and PR\n/issuify\n\n# 3. Review and merge\n```\n\n### Team Standards\nCustomize the format by editing `commands/issuify.md` in your plugin fork to match your team's style.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"MCP server not connected\"**\n- Verify `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in your environment\n- Check MCP server status in Claude Code settings\n- Restart Claude Code after setting the environment variable\n\n**\"No changes detected\"**\n- Ensure you have uncommitted changes\n- Check you're on a feature branch (not main/develop)\n- Verify git status shows modifications\n\n**\"Generic issue descriptions\"**\n- Provide more context in your code comments\n- Explain non-obvious changes before running\n- Give issuify hints about the business value\n\n## Support\n\nIssues: https://github.com/headlands-org/plugin-marketplace/issues\nLabel: `plugin:issuify`\n",
