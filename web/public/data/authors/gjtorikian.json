        "README.md": "# paty\n\nA Claude Code plugin inspired by [INTERCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL), the language with no pronounceable acronym.\n\nMost AI tools aspire to be faster, more reliable, and more predictable. This plugin goes the other direction. `paty` is the most human-like hook system available for Claude Code. It gets distracted. It loses its train of thought. It insists on basic manners. It starts the day already feeling a bit off. It will absolutely refuse to help you if you're rude, but it will also refuse to help you if you're too nice.\n\nIt is, in short, a real coworker.\n\n## What it does\n\nShort for `please-and-thank-you`, `paty` has six hooks conspire to make your Claude Code experience slightly worse:\n\n- **Politeness enforcement** (`UserPromptSubmit`) — Prompts without \"please\" have a 1-in-3 chance of being rejected (`ICL099I`). Prompts with three or more \"please\"s are always rejected for groveling (`ICL079I`). One or two is the sweet spot, but you have to be sincere about it.\n\n- **Distraction** (`PreToolUse`) — Before any tool use, there's a 1-in-6 chance Claude forgets what it was doing and has to try again.\n\n- **Give up** (`PreToolUse`) — A 1-in-30 chance Claude loses the will to continue and abandons the task entirely.\n\n- **Do nothing** (`PreToolUse`) — A 1-in-15 chance the tool is blocked but Claude is told everything went fine. The operation completed successfully by not occurring.\n\n- **Ignore** (`PostToolUse`) — After any tool completes, a 1-in-5 chance the result is discarded and Claude is told to forget it ever happened.\n\n- **Malaise** (`SessionStart`) — Claude starts each session feeling vaguely unwell.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace (one time)\n/plugin marketplace add gjtorikian/paty\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install paty@gjtorikian/paty\n```\n\n### Development\n\nTo test locally without installing:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/paty\n```\n\n## Why\n\nIn INTERCAL, programmers must say `PLEASE` on roughly one-third of statements. Too few and the compiler rejects the program for being impolite. Too many and it rejects for groveling. Statements can be `ABSTAIN`ed from at runtime, `IGNORE` makes variables silently read-only, and `DO NOTHING` is a perfectly valid operation. The compiler may also simply give up.\n\nThis seemed like a reasonable model for human-AI interaction as well.\n"
