        "README.md": "# dev-flow Plugin\n\nComprehensive release management and versioning guidance for Claude Code projects.\n\n## Overview\n\n**dev-flow** provides comprehensive release and git workflow management for teams. It guides semantic versioning with bracket-based freezing, branch strategy coordination, and systematic rebase conflict resolution. Works with single-component projects, multi-component systems, monorepos, and Claude plugins.\n\n## What It Does\n\n### Release Management\n\nThe **release-process** skill guides you through:\n\n- **Assessing release scope** — Determine if changes are PATCH, MINOR, or MAJOR\n- **Applying bracket system** — Freeze at scope level, jump higher if scope creeps\n- **Version bumping** — Correctly increment version numbers across all files\n- **Changelog management** — Document user-facing changes only (no version bump documentation)\n- **Multi-component coordination** — Manage independent versions with parent version rules\n- **Release workflows** — Step-by-step procedures for common scenarios\n\n### Branch Strategy\n\nThe **git-flow** and **git-flow-next** skills help you:\n\n- **Choose your workflow** — Traditional git-flow for all platforms, or modern git-flow-next for macOS\n- **Set up branching** — Initialize and configure feature/release/hotfix branches\n- **Coordinate releases** — Integrate with release-process for semantic versioning\n- **Manage hotfixes** — Handle production emergencies without disrupting development\n- **Support team workflows** — Multiple concurrent features, explicit dev/prod separation\n- **Customize strategies** — git-flow-next supports GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and custom presets\n\n### Git Rebase Conflict Resolution\n\nThe **rebase-resolver** skill helps you:\n\n- **Resolve conflicts one block at a time** — Systematic approach avoiding bulk operations\n- **Verify before committing** — Grep verification prevents incomplete resolutions\n- **Leverage git rerere** — Block-by-block resolution enables conflict pattern learning\n- **Handle edge cases** — Nested markers, AA conflicts, and shifted line numbers\n- **Continue rebases safely** — Ensure all conflicts resolved before proceeding\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add full-stack-biz/claude-dev-flow\n/plugin install dev-flow@dev-flow-marketplace\n```\n\nOr directly from GitHub:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install https://github.com/full-stack-biz/claude-dev-flow --scope user\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWhen planning a release, ask Claude:\n\n> \"Help me release version X.Y.Z for my project\"\n\nor\n\n> \"Guide me through the release process using the bracket system\"\n\nThe plugin will:\n1. Help assess the scope of changes\n2. Apply bracket-based version freezing rules\n3. Guide you through updating version files\n4. Ensure your changelog follows best practices\n5. Help you commit and tag the release\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Bracket System\n\nPrevents version thrashing by freezing at scope level:\n\n- **PATCH bracket** (Z) — Bug fixes, docs, wording\n- **MINOR bracket** (Y) — New features, backward compatible\n- **MAJOR bracket** (X) — Breaking changes\n\n**Core principle:** Version freezes at bracket level until commit. Can jump to higher bracket if scope demands it. After commit, reset for next cycle.\n\n### Version Freezing\n\n```\nLast commit: 1.2.0\nStart patch work → 1.2.1 (patch frozen)\nDiscover new feature → 1.3.0 (minor frozen, jumped brackets)\nDiscover breaking change → 2.0.0 (major frozen, jumped brackets)\nMore work discovered → 2.0.0 (major, don't bump further)\nCommit: 2.0.0\n```\n\n### Changelog Rules\n\n1. **Document user-facing changes only** — Skip internal refactoring, cleanup\n2. **Never document version bumps** — NO \"Bumped to 1.2.3\"\n3. **Verify against git diff** — Run `git diff` before writing changelog\n4. **Be specific** — \"Reduced search time from 500ms to 50ms\" not \"Improved performance\"\n\n### Multi-Component Projects\n\nIn monorepos and plugins:\n- Each component versions independently\n- Parent version ≥ highest child version\n- Only update components that changed\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ndev-flow/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json              #

Guide me through releasing with scope creep\"\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Release & Versioning\n✅ **Bracket System** — Prevents version thrashing with intelligent scope management\n✅ **Multi-Component Support** — Handles monorepos, plugins, and multi-service projects\n✅ **Changelog Best Practices** — Critical rules for documenting changes correctly\n✅ **Semantic Versioning** — Complete guidance for MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH decisions\n\n### Branch Strategy\n✅ **Multiple Workflows** — Traditional git-flow + modern git-flow-next (macOS)\n✅ **Cross-Platform Support** — git-flow works on macOS, Linux, and Windows\n✅ **Feature/Release/Hotfix** — Complete branching model for team development\n✅ **Flexible Configuration** — Customizable branch types, prefixes, and merge strategies\n✅ **Workflow Presets** — GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and Classic GitFlow templates\n\n### Git Operations\n✅ **Systematic Conflict Resolution** — Block-by-block approach prevents bulk operation mistakes\n✅ **Verification Rules** — Mandatory grep checks ensure completeness\n✅ **Rerere Integration** — Enables conflict pattern learning for future reuses\n✅ **Reference Guides** — Comprehensive documentation for complex scenarios\n✅ **Team Ready** — Works with all project types and team sizes\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"My version numbers don't align\"\n\nCheck the bracket rules — Parent version should be ≥ highest child version.\n\n### \"I documented a version bump in changelog\"\n\nRemove it! Changelogs document **changes**, not **version management**. The version is in the header: `## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-21`\n\n### \"I forgot to update a version file\"\n\nDon't amend the commit. Create a new commit to fix it.\n\n### \"Should I release a pre-release version?\"\n\nUse pre-releases (`2.0.0-alpha.1`, `2.0.0-beta.1`, `2.0.0-rc.1`) when testing major changes with team before stable release.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo improve this plugin:\n\n1. Follow the release process documented in the skill\n2. Update version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes\n4. Create a commit with the version bump\n5.
