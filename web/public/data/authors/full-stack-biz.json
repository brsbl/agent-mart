        "README.md": "# Skills Toolkit for Claude Code\n\nA plugin for creating and managing Claude Code skills and plugins.\n\n## What You Get\n\n### `/skills-toolkit:create-skill`\nInteractive guide for creating new skills from scratch:\n- Name and describe your skill\n- Structure SKILL.md (frontmatter + instructions)\n- Set up reference documentation\n- Configure tool permissions\n- Apply best practices during creation\n\n### `/skills-toolkit:skill-refiner`\nInteractive guide for improving and validating existing skills:\n- Refine skill structure and clarity\n- Validate against best practices\n- Reduce token usage and improve efficiency\n- Check production readiness\n- Apply the 80% rule for optimization\n\n### `/skills-toolkit:create-plugin`\nInteractive guide for creating and validating plugins:\n- Generate `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest\n- Organize skills, commands, hooks, MCP/LSP servers\n- Convert existing projects to plugins\n- Configure installation scope (user/project/managed)\n- Validate plugin structure\n\n### `/skills-toolkit:create-hook`\nInteractive guide for creating and validating hooks:\n- Build plugin hooks from scratch (command, prompt, agent types)\n- Validate existing hooks against best practices\n- Refine hook quality (event matching, error handling, performance)\n- Configure event matching, matchers, and error handling\n- Test hooks with validation workflows\n\n### `/skills-toolkit:create-subagent`\nInteractive guide for creating and validating subagents:\n- Build subagents with clear delegation signals\n- Configure tool access with permission modes\n- Set up hooks for agent coordination\n- Validate against best practices for reliability\n\n## Quick Start: From Knowledge to Plugin\n\n### The Problem\n\nTeams struggle with processes that matter but don't get followed. You document a release process, testing workflow, or code review guide. It sits in a repo. People don't find it. They forget it. They ask the same questions.\n\n### The Solution: Interactive Guidance\n\nInstead of documentation sitting idle, turn it into a skill—interactive guidance Claude activates when relevant. Then package it as a plugin so your team can install it once and get the full workflow.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Start with what you know** - You have documentation, a process guide, or expertise\n2. **Turn it into a skill** - Use `/skills-toolkit:create-skill` to formalize it into instructions Claude follows\n3. **Refine for quality** - Use `/skills-toolkit:skill-refiner` to optimize clarity, efficiency, and production readiness\n4. **Package for your team** - Use `/skills-toolkit:create-plugin` to make it installable\n5. **Share and evolve** - Team members install once, Claude guides the process every time\n\n### Real Example: Release Process to Plugin\n\n**User:** `@RELEASE_PROCESS.md` — I have this release management guide. Turn it into a skill.\n\nClaude asked clarifying questions:\n- Where should this skill live?\n- Will this be used by your team or in production?\n\n**User:** Plugin skill. Team and production.\n\nClaude built it. Created the skill with a detailed workflow. Extracted supporting material into reference guides. Added proper frontmatter, scoped the tools, made it activatable.\n\n**User:** Now package this into a plugin so I can share it.\n\nClaude asked:\n- What would you like to do?\n- What should the plugin be named?\n\n**User:** Convert this project. Call it dev-flow.\n\nClaude created the plugin manifest, README, changelog, added the skill, made it installable.\n\n**User:** Do a fresh review. Make sure everything is solid.\n\nClaude asked (using skill-refiner):\n- Which refinement areas matter most for your team?\n\n**User:** Activation & trigger phrases, token efficiency, quick start strengthening, error prevention guardrails.\n\nClaude re-read what was built. Found ambiguities. Refined the guidance. Tightened the wording. Caught its own mistakes.\n\n### Why This Pattern Works\n\n1. Knowledge in documentation gets ignored. Skills get loaded.\n2. Skills activate automatically when relevant. Documentation doesn't.\n3. Plugins make skills installable and shareable across teams.\n4. Iteration catches gaps the first draft misses.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add full-stack-biz/claude-skills-toolkit\n/plugin install skills-toolkit@skills-toolkit-marketplace\n```\n\nOr directly from GitHub:\n```bash\nclaude plugin install https://github.com/full-stack-biz/claude-skills-toolkit --scope user\n```\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Build a Domain-Specific Skill\nYou have specialized knowledge about API testing and want Claude to consistently follow your testing patterns.\n\n```\nI need to build a new skill for API testing.\n```\n\nThe guide walks you through defining trigger phrases (so Claude activates it automatically when relevant), structuring your instructions clearly, and validating it works as expected.\n\nResult: A reusable skill Claude activates whenever you mention API testing or validation.\n\n### Scenario 2: Create a Team Plugin\nYour team needs multiple tools: a code review skill, deployment automation, and custom hooks for validation.\n\n```\nI need to build a plugin from scratch for our team.\n```\n\nOrganize all components into one installable plugin with a single manifest. Team members install once and get all capabilities.\n\nResult: Shareable plugin your team can install and keep up to date.\n\n### Scenario 3: Refine an Existing Skill\nYou have a skill that mostly works but want to ensure Claude understands it correctly and it's optimized.\n\n```\nI need to refine an existing skill against best practices.\n```\n\nUse skill-refiner to validate structure, trigger phrases, token efficiency, tool permissions, and production readiness.\n\nResult: Confidence your skill works reliably, loads efficiently, and meets quality standards.\n\n### Scenario 4: Convert a Project to a Plugin\nYou have an existing project with helper scripts, documentation, and utilities. You want to make it installable as a Claude plugin.\n\n```\nI need to convert my project to a Claude plugin.\n```\n\nThe guide generates the proper manifest structure, organizes your files, and validates everything is set up correctly.\n\nResult: Your project becomes an installable plugin others can discover and use.\n\n### Scenario 5: Set Up Team Distribution\nYou've created several skills and want your organization to access them through a central marketplace.\n\n```\nI need to improve my plugin structure for team distribution.\n```\n\nCreate a marketplace plugin that bundles your skills. Push it to GitHub. Team members install once from your marketplace.\n\nResult: Centralized distribution with version control and easy updates.\n\n## Design Notes: Architecture & DRY\n\nThis toolkit follows **Claude's Bounded Scope Principle** for skills, which creates some intentional knowledge duplication:\n\n- **plugin-creator** includes summaries of skill/subagent/hook concepts for users getting started with plugins\n- **skill-creator**, **skill-refiner**, **subagent-creator**, and **hook-creator** provide authoritative, detailed knowledge\n- These overlap because Claude's skill architecture doesn't support skill-to-skill delegation yet\n\n**Why this design?** Each skill must be completely self-contained within its directory—this ensures skills work reliably across any deployment context (local, project, user, marketplace). For details, see [Bounded Scope Principle](skills/skill-creator/references/bounded-scope-principle.md).\n\n**When will this improve?** Claude is actively developing support for full skill delegation via `context: fork`. Once stable, we can reorganize for better Single Responsibility Principle separation.\n\n**Does this affect you?** No. All skills work exactly as expected. The duplication is internal and intentional.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThe original inspiration for this project came from the comprehensive best practices guide:\n- [Best Practices for Writing and Using SKILL.md Files](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/meta_skill/blob/main/BEST_PRACTICES_FOR_WRITING_AND_USING_SKILLS_MD_FILES.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Author\n\n[full-stack-biz](https://github.com/full-stack-biz)\n"

        "README.md": "# dev-flow Plugin\n\nComprehensive release management and versioning guidance for Claude Code projects.\n\n## Overview\n\n**dev-flow** provides comprehensive release and git workflow management for teams. It guides semantic versioning with bracket-based freezing, branch strategy coordination, and systematic rebase conflict resolution. Works with single-component projects, multi-component systems, monorepos, and Claude plugins.\n\n## What It Does\n\n### Release Management\n\nThe **release-process** skill guides you through:\n\n- **Assessing release scope** — Determine if changes are PATCH, MINOR, or MAJOR\n- **Applying bracket system** — Freeze at scope level, jump higher if scope creeps\n- **Version bumping** — Correctly increment version numbers across all files\n- **Changelog management** — Document user-facing changes only (no version bump documentation)\n- **Multi-component coordination** — Manage independent versions with parent version rules\n- **Release workflows** — Step-by-step procedures for common scenarios\n\n### Branch Strategy\n\nThe **git-flow** and **git-flow-next** skills help you:\n\n- **Choose your workflow** — Traditional git-flow for all platforms, or modern git-flow-next for macOS\n- **Set up branching** — Initialize and configure feature/release/hotfix branches\n- **Coordinate releases** — Integrate with release-process for semantic versioning\n- **Manage hotfixes** — Handle production emergencies without disrupting development\n- **Support team workflows** — Multiple concurrent features, explicit dev/prod separation\n- **Customize strategies** — git-flow-next supports GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and custom presets\n\n### Git Rebase Conflict Resolution\n\nThe **rebase-resolver** skill helps you:\n\n- **Resolve conflicts one block at a time** — Systematic approach avoiding bulk operations\n- **Verify before committing** — Grep verification prevents incomplete resolutions\n- **Leverage git rerere** — Block-by-block resolution enables conflict pattern learning\n- **Handle edge cases** — Nested markers, AA conflicts, and shifted line numbers\n- **Continue rebases safely** — Ensure all conflicts resolved before proceeding\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add full-stack-biz/claude-dev-flow\n/plugin install dev-flow@dev-flow-marketplace\n```\n\nOr directly from GitHub:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install https://github.com/full-stack-biz/claude-dev-flow --scope user\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWhen planning a release, ask Claude:\n\n> \"Help me release version X.Y.Z for my project\"\n\nor\n\n> \"Guide me through the release process using the bracket system\"\n\nThe plugin will:\n1. Help assess the scope of changes\n2. Apply bracket-based version freezing rules\n3. Guide you through updating version files\n4. Ensure your changelog follows best practices\n5. Help you commit and tag the release\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Bracket System\n\nPrevents version thrashing by freezing at scope level:\n\n- **PATCH bracket** (Z) — Bug fixes, docs, wording\n- **MINOR bracket** (Y) — New features, backward compatible\n- **MAJOR bracket** (X) — Breaking changes\n\n**Core principle:** Version freezes at bracket level until commit. Can jump to higher bracket if scope demands it. After commit, reset for next cycle.\n\n### Version Freezing\n\n```\nLast commit: 1.2.0\nStart patch work → 1.2.1 (patch frozen)\nDiscover new feature → 1.3.0 (minor frozen, jumped brackets)\nDiscover breaking change → 2.0.0 (major frozen, jumped brackets)\nMore work discovered → 2.0.0 (major, don't bump further)\nCommit: 2.0.0\n```\n\n### Changelog Rules\n\n1. **Document user-facing changes only** — Skip internal refactoring, cleanup\n2. **Never document version bumps** — NO \"Bumped to 1.2.3\"\n3. **Verify against git diff** — Run `git diff` before writing changelog\n4. **Be specific** — \"Reduced search time from 500ms to 50ms\" not \"Improved performance\"\n\n### Multi-Component Projects\n\nIn monorepos and plugins:\n- Each component versions independently\n- Parent version ≥ highest child version\n- Only update components that changed\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ndev-flow/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json              #
