        "README.md": "# React Native & Expo Complete Skills\n\nThe most comprehensive React Native, Expo, and React optimization skills for Claude Code. Combines **130+ rules** from Callstack, Expo, and Vercel best practices.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add gigs-slc/react-native-skills\n/plugin install react-native-expo-complete@react-native-expo-skills\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Code to load the skills.\n\n## What's Included\n\n### 10 Skills + 8 Agents + Templates\n\n#### Skills\n\n| Skill | Source | Content | Description |\n|-------|--------|---------|-------------|\n| `react-native` | **Callstack + Vercel** | 65 files | **THE ULTIMATE RN SKILL** - Combined profiling + patterns |\n| `react-best-practices` | Vercel | 62 files | React patterns, hooks, performance, architecture |\n| `composition-patterns` | Vercel | 12 files | Component composition, compound components |\n| `building-ui` | Expo | 14 files | UI components, styling, animations, navigation |\n| `data-fetching` | Expo | 1 file | fetch, axios, React Query, SWR, caching |\n| `api-routes` | Expo | 1 file | API routes with Expo Router + EAS Hosting |\n| `dev-client` | Expo | 1 file | Development client builds, TestFlight |\n| `tailwind-setup` | Expo | 1 file | Tailwind CSS v4 + NativeWind v5 setup |\n| `upgrading-expo` | Expo | 4 files | SDK upgrades, React 19, New Architecture |\n| `use-dom` | Expo | 1 file | DOM components, web-to-native migration |\n\n#### Agents\n\n| Agent | Use When | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `orchestrator` | Coordinating multi-agent workflows | Master coordinator that enforces constraints and delegates to sub-agents |\n| `react-native-expo-architect` | BEFORE implementation | Designs features, makes architectural decisions, creates implementation plans |\n| `react-native-expo-implementation` | AFTER architecture plan exists | Writes production code following the approved plan |\n| `react-native-expo-code-review` | AFTER code is written | Reviews diffs, validates scope, checks for bugs and constraint violations |\n| `react-native-expo-bugfix` | Investigating runtime errors | Diagnoses crashes, bugs, and errors without implementing fixes |\n| `performance-re-render` | Performance matters | Identifies re-renders, memory leaks, JS thread issues |\n| `navigation-expo-router` | Navigation behavior involved | Validates routes, params, deep links, platform parity |\n| `mobile-release-gate` | Before merging/shipping | Final production-readiness check - SHIP or NO SHIP decision |\n\n### Agent Workflow\n\nThe Orchestrator is the **central hub** - every sub-agent reports back before the next step:\n\n```\nUser Request\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Reads constraints, analyzes task\n    ↓\n    ├──→ [Architect] ─── Designs the solution\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Reviews & approves plan\n    ↓\n    ├──→ [Implementation] ─── Writes the code\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Verifies implementation matches plan\n    ↓\n    ├──→ [Code Review] ─── Validates the changes\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Confirms review passed\n    ↓\n    ├──→ [Performance] ─── Checks performance (if needed)\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Confirms no performance issues\n    ↓\n    ├──→ [Release Gate] ─── Final ship/no-ship decision\n    ↓\n[Orchestrator] ─── Updates AI_PROGRESS.md, reports to user\n```\n\n**Key principle**: No sub-agent hands off directly to another. The Orchestrator approves every transition.\n\n### Orchestrator Agent\n\nThe **Orchestrator Agent** is the master coordinator. It:\n- Reads `AI_CONSTRAINTS.md` before any work begins\n- Tracks progress in `AI_PROGRESS.md`\n- Delegates to specialized agents based on task type\n- Ensures proper agent sequencing\n- Never violates constraints\n\n### Project Governance Templates\n\nThe Orchestrator and sub-agents require these governance files. Download and customize for your project:\n\n| Template | Purpose | Download |\n|----------|---------|----------|\n| `AI_CONSTRAINTS.md` | Define non-negotiable rules for all AI agents | [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigs-slc/react-native-skills/main/templates/AI_CONSTRAINTS.md) |\n| `AI_PROGRESS.md` | Track work status, decisions, and blockers | [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigs-slc/react-native-skills/main/templates/AI_PROGRESS.md) |\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Download templates to your project\nmkdir -p docs\ncurl -o docs/AI_CONSTRAINTS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigs-slc/react-native-skills/main/templates/AI_CONSTRAINTS.md\ncurl -o docs/AI_PROGRESS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gigs-slc/react-native-skills/main/templates/AI_PROGRESS.md\n```\n\nThen:\n1. Customize `AI_CONSTRAINTS.md` for your codebase rules\n2. Update `AI_PROGRESS.md` as work progresses\n3. Reference both in your `CLAUDE.md` or project instructions\n\n### The Unified `react-native` Skill\n\nThe crown jewel - combines **Callstack profiling** with **Vercel code patterns**:\n\n```\nskills/react-native/\n├── SKILL.md              # Combined quick reference\n├── AGENTS.md             # Full 74KB Vercel compiled guide\n├── rules/                # 36 Vercel rule files\n│   ├── list-performance-*.md\n│   ├── animation-*.md\n│   ├── ui-*.md\n│   ├── react-state-*.md\n│   └── ...\n└── references/           # 27 Callstack reference files\n    ├── js-*.md           # FPS, re-renders, memory, animations\n    ├── native-*.md       # TTI, profiling, Turbo Modules\n    ├── bundle-*.md       # Size analysis, tree shaking, R8\n    └── images/\n```\n\n### Coverage Areas\n\n**Performance (Callstack)**\n- FPS measurement & re-render profiling\n- Bundle size analysis & tree shaking\n- TTI optimization & native profiling\n- Memory leak detection (JS & native)\n- Hermes optimization, R8, compression\n\n**Code Patterns (Vercel)**\n- List virtualization (FlashList, LegendList)\n- Animation best practices (Reanimated)\n- React state patterns & architecture\n- React Compiler compatibility\n- UI components (native menus, modals, images)\n\n**Expo & React (Expo + Vercel)**\n- Expo Router navigation\n- Data fetching strategies\n- Tailwind/NativeWind styling\n- SDK upgrades & migrations\n- React hooks & composition patterns\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation, invoke skills in Claude Code:\n\n```\n/react-native              # THE BIG ONE - Callstack + Vercel combined\n/react-best-practices      # General React patterns\n/composition-patterns      # Component architecture\n/building-ui               # Expo UI patterns\n/data-fetching             # API & caching\n```\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis collection combines skills from:\n- **Callstack** - \"The Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization\"\n- **Vercel** - React Native Skills, React Best Practices, Composition Patterns\n- **Expo** - Official Expo skills for app development\n\n## License\n\nMIT - See individual skill directories for original licenses.\n"
