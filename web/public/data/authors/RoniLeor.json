Uses code-reviewer for deep analysis, code-consolidator for context, parallel web research for solutions, and atomic phase implementation with review gates.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. **Phase 0: Bug Investigation** - Parallel: code-reviewer (deep analysis) + code-consolidator (documentation context)\n2. **Phase 1: Bug Clarification** - User confirms bug details\n3. **Phase 2: Solution Research** - 4 parallel web searches for language-specific fixes, framework issues, community solutions, prevention patterns\n4. **Phase 3: Solution Design** - Atomic fix phases with user approval\n5. **Phase 3.5: Design Review** - code-reviewer validates fix design\n6. **Phase 4: Phased Implementation** - Fix each phase with mandatory review gates\n7. **Phase 5: Regression Testing** - User verifies fix works\n8. **Phase 6: Documentation Update** - Update docs after fix confirmed\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/feature-bugfix camera-connection\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n.claude/specs/bugfix-camera-connection/\n├── 00-investigation.md         # Bug investigation\n├── 01-bug-report.md            # User-confirmed bugs\n├── 02-research.md              # Solution research\n├── 03-solution-design.md       # Fix strategy\n├── 03-design-review.md         # Design review\n├── phase-1-{name}.md           # Atomic fix phases\n└── phase-1-{name}-review.md    # Phase reviews\n```\n\n---\n\n### `/feature-refactor` - Comprehensive Feature Refactoring\n\nRefactor an existing feature with deep code understanding, documentation review, atomic phase breakdown, incremental changes, and comprehensive review loops.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. **Phase 0: Feature Understanding** - Parallel: code-explorer (deep analysis) + code-consolidator (docs review), then assess complexity\n2. **Phase 0.5: Targeted Research** (optional) - Only for HIGH complexity refactors\n3. **Phase 1: Gap Analysis** - Identify what needs to change, check for existing code to reuse\n4. **Phase 2: Atomic Phase Design** - Incremental design with user approval per phase\n5. **Phase 3: Phased Implementation** - Refactor each phase with mandatory review gates\n6. **Phase 4: Final Integration Review** - Comprehensive refactor verification\n7. **Phase 5: Documentation Update** - Update docs after user confirms refactor works\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/feature-refactor Extract service layer from monolithic tracker\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n.claude/specs/refactor-tracker/\n├── 01-understanding.md         # Feature understanding\n├── 00-research.md              # Targeted research (if HIGH complexity)\n├── 01-gap-analysis.md          # Gap analysis with reuse strategy\n├── 02-overview.md              # Refactor overview\n├── phase-1-{name}.md           # Atomic refactor phases\n└── phase-1-{name}-review.md    # Phase reviews\n```\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via Claude Code Plugin Marketplace\n\n1. In Claude Code, type `/plugin`\n2. Select **\"Add marketplace\"** (option 3)\n3. Enter: `https://github.com/RoniLeor/specWeaver`\n4. Select **specweaver** from the list and click Install\n5. Verify installation with `/plugin list`\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Copy the `plugins/specweaver` directory to your project's `plugins/` folder\n2. Claude Code will automatically detect the plugin\n3. Commands will be available via `/feature-new`, `/feature-bugfix`, `/feature-refactor`\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Example 1: Building a New Feature\n\n```bash\n# Start a new feature with best practices research\n/feature-new Add user authentication with JWT tokens\n\n# The workflow will:\n# 1. Search for auth best practices (SOLID, security patterns, JWT patterns)\n# 2. Explore existing authentication code in your project\n# 3. Design atomic phases (one at a time with your approval)\n# 4. Review the design before implementation\n# 5. Implement each phase with automatic code review gates\n# 6. Ask you to test before updating documentation\n```\n\n### Example 2: Fixing a Bug\n\n```bash\n# Start bug investigation\n/feature-bugfix user-login-timeout\n\n# The workflow will:\n# 1. Analyze the login code for potential issues\n# 2. Ask you to describe the bug symptoms\n# 3. Research timeout issues and solutions\n# 4. Design atomic fix phases\n# 5. Implement with review gates\n# 6. Ask you to verify the fix works\n# 7. Update documentation\n```\n\n### Example 3: Refactoring\n\n```bash\n# Refactor with smart research decision\n/feature-refactor Split monolithic UserService into domain services\n\n# The workflow will:\n# 1. Deeply understand the current UserService\n# 2. Assess complexity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)\n# 3. Research only if HIGH complexity (skips for simple refactors)\n# 4. Find existing code to reuse (avoid duplication)\n# 5. Design atomic refactor phases\n# 6. Implement with review gates\n# 7. Update documentation\n```\n\n## Specification Files\n\nAll workflows create detailed specification files in `.claude/specs/`:\n\n- **Research files** (`00-research.md`, `02-research.md`) - Best practices, patterns, domain-specific findings\n- **Exploration files** (`01-exploration.md`, `01-understanding.md`) - Codebase context, related features\n- **Design files** (`03-overview.md`, `03-solution-design.md`) - Architecture decisions, approach\n- **Phase specs** (`phase-{X}-{name}.md`) - Atomic implementation phases\n- **Review files** (`*-review.md`) - Design and implementation review feedback\n\nThese files provide:\n- Complete audit trail of decisions\n- Knowledge transfer for team members\n- Reference for future similar features\n- Historical context for refactors\n\n## Benefits\n\n### For Individual Developers\n\n- ✅ **Stop Missing Edge Cases** - Research and review catch issues early\n- ✅ **Build Consistent Architecture** - Follows existing patterns automatically\n- ✅ **Get Unstuck Faster** - Structured workflow guides you through complexity\n- ✅ **Learn Best Practices** - Research phase teaches SOLID principles and patterns\n\n### For Teams\n\n- 📋 **Complete Audit Trail** - Every decision documented in specs\n- 🔄 **Consistent Quality** - Mandatory review gates ensure standards\n- 📚 **Knowledge Sharing** - Specs become team learning resource\n- ⚡ **Faster Onboarding** - New developers see how features were built\n\n### For Codebases\n\n- 🏗️ **Better Architecture** - Research-informed design decisions\n- 🔍 **Less Technical Debt** - Code review before merging\n- 📖 **Up-to-Date Docs** - Automatic documentation updates\n- 🎯 **Zero Duplication** - Reuse analysis prevents redundant code\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Parallel Execution\n\nSpecWeaver uses parallel execution for efficiency:\n- **Research**: 4 web searches in a single message\n- **Investigation**: code-reviewer + code-consolidator simultaneously\n- **Refactor Understanding**: code-explorer + code-consolidator together\n\n### Smart Research Decision\n\nThe `/feature-refactor` command intelligently decides if research is needed:\n- **LOW Complexity** → Skip research (simple cleanup, renaming)\n- **MEDIUM Complexity** → Ask user if research needed\n- **HIGH Complexity** → Targeted research on specific topics\n\nThis prevents over-engineering simple refactors while ensuring complex ones get proper research.\n\n### Incremental Phase Design\n\nAll workflows design phases **one at a time** with user approval:\n1. Design Phase 1 → Show to user → Get approval\n2. Design Phase 2 → Show to user → Get approval\n3. Continue until all phases approved\n\nThis prevents wasted work if the approach needs adjustment.\n\n### Mandatory Review Gates\n\nEvery implementation phase has a **mandatory review gate**:\n```\nFor each phase:\n├── Implement changes\n├── MANDATORY code review (code-reviewer)\n└── Fix issues until approved (≥ 80% confidence)\n```\n\nYou **cannot proceed** to the next phase until the current phase passes review.\n\n### Code Reuse Analysis\n\nThe `/feature-refactor` workflow includes **code reuse analysis**:\n- Searches for existing similar code\n- Recommends reuse vs. create new\n- Prevents duplication and unnecessary rewrites\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Agent Tools\n\nAll agents have access to:\n- `Glob`, `Grep`, `LS`, `Read` - Code exploration\n- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Research capabilities\n- `TodoWrite` - Task tracking\n- `NotebookRead` - Jupyter notebook support\n\n### Model Configuration\n\nAll agents use `model: sonnet` by default. You can override this in your `.claude/settings.local.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": {\n    \"code-explorer\": {\n      \"model\": \"opus\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis plugin is part of the SpecWeaver project.
