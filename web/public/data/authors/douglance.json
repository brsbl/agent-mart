        "README.md": "# DevSQL\n\n**Query your AI coding history to become a better prompter.**\n\nDevSQL lets you analyze your Claude Code conversations alongside your Git commits. Find your most productive prompts, identify patterns in successful coding sessions, and learn what actually works for you.\n\n## Why?\n\nYour `~/.claude/` folder contains a goldmine of data: every prompt you've written, every tool Claude used, every conversation that led to shipped code. DevSQL turns that into queryable insights.\n\n**Ask questions like:**\n- \"Which of my prompts led to the most commits?\"\n- \"What patterns do my successful coding sessions have?\"\n- \"When do I struggle most—and what prompts help me recover?\"\n- \"Which tools does Claude use most when I'm productive?\"\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n### Find Your Most Productive Prompts\n```bash\n# See which prompts preceded commits\ndevsql \"SELECT h.display as prompt, COUNT(c.id) as commits_after\nFROM history h\nLEFT JOIN commits c ON DATE(datetime(h.timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch')) = DATE(c.authored_at)\nGROUP BY h.display\nHAVING commits_after > 0\nORDER BY commits_after DESC\nLIMIT 20\"\n```\n\n### Identify Struggle Sessions\n```bash\n# High prompt count + few commits = struggling\ndevsql \"SELECT\n  DATE(datetime(h.timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch')) as day,\n  COUNT(*) as prompts,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as commits,\n  CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) / MAX(1, COUNT(DISTINCT c.id)) as struggle_ratio\nFROM history h\nLEFT JOIN commits c ON DATE(datetime(h.timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch')) = DATE(c.authored_at)\nGROUP BY day\nORDER BY struggle_ratio DESC\nLIMIT 10\"\n```\n\n### Analyze Your Prompting Patterns\n```bash\n# What tools correlate with productivity?\nccql \"SELECT tool_name, COUNT(*) as uses\nFROM transcripts\nWHERE type = 'tool_use'\nGROUP BY tool_name\nORDER BY uses DESC\"\n```\n\n### Train Your AI Agent\nTell Claude Code to query your history:\n\n> \"Use devsql to find my 10 most effective prompts from the past month—the ones that led to commits the same day. Then analyze what they have in common.\"\n\n> \"Query my Claude history to find sessions where I used many prompts but made few commits. What was I struggling with?\"\n\n> \"Find patterns in my successful refactoring sessions using devsql.\"\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)\n\nInstall the plugin to use devsql directly within Claude Code:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add douglance/devsql\n/plugin install devsql@devsql\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code to load the plugin. The plugin auto-installs the devsql binary on first use.\n\n**Usage:**\n- `/devsql:query SELECT * FROM history LIMIT 10` - Direct SQL queries\n- Or just ask Claude: \"Show my most productive prompts from last week\"\n\n### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)\n```bash\nbrew install douglance/tap/devsql\n```\n\n### Direct Download\nDownload from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/douglance/devsql/releases) for macOS or Linux.\n\n### Build from Source\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/douglance/devsql.git\ncd devsql && cargo install --path crates/devsql\n```\n\n## The Three Tools\n\n| Tool | What It Queries |\n|------|-----------------|\n| `ccql` | Your Claude Code data (~/.claude/) |\n| `vcsql` | Your Git repositories |\n| `devsql` | Both together—join conversations with commits |\n\n## Available Tables\n\n**Claude Code**: `history` (your prompts), `transcripts` (full conversations), `todos` (tasks)\n\n**Git**: `commits`, `branches`, `tags`, `diffs`, `diff_files`, `blame`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
