The tools don't explain their ideas—they _practice_ them.\n\nThey help us notice what connects, learn without extracting, and participate in an ecology co-evolving through our attention.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Companions on the Path: The Pattern That Connects</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>\n\n![Gregory Bateson](docs/images/gregory-bateson.jpg)\n_Photo: [Barry Schwartz](https://barryschwartzphoto.com/)_\n\n### The Young Anthropologists and the Question of Fascism\n\nIn 1932, Gregory Bateson met Margaret Mead on the Sepik River in New Guinea. Both were in their late twenties. The world was darkening—Mussolini had been in power for a decade, Hitler was ascending, and the patterns of thought that would consume Europe were already taking hold.\n\nBateson had been studying the Iatmul people, watching their elaborate rituals of boasting and counter-boasting, dominance and submission. He noticed something troubling: communication could become a runaway process. When one group boasts, the other boasts back louder. When one side dominates, the other submits further, inviting more dominance. He called this _schismogenesis_—the creation of division through escalating feedback. Left unchecked, it tears societies apart.\n\nThen he and Mead went to Bali. There they found something different. The Balinese practiced what Bateson called \"stasis\"—their interactions didn't spiral. Competition didn't escalate into arms races; submission didn't deepen into abjection. Somehow, their culture had patterns that absorbed perturbation rather than amplifying it.\n\nThe question haunting this work: _Could communication be shaped to resist the runaway polarization that feeds totalitarianism?_\n\nThis wasn't abstract. By the time they returned to America in 1939, war had begun. They turned their anthropological methods toward understanding fascist propaganda, analyzing Nazi films, studying \"national character\" at a distance. Mead and Bateson even designed a board game—never published—based on the principle that \"Democracies and Dictators play by different rules.\"\n\nBut Bateson grew troubled. Using his theories as propaganda tools—even against fascism—felt like participating in the very escalation he had diagnosed. After the war, he largely withdrew from applied social science, turning instead toward cybernetics, ecology, and the question of how living systems learn.\n\n### The Pattern That Connects\n\nWhat emerged from this journey was a different way of seeing. Bateson came to understand mind not as something inside brains, but as a pattern distributed through living systems—families, forests, societies, the relationship between organisms and their environments.\n\nHe asked: _What is the pattern that connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose, and all four of them to me? And me to you?_\n\nAnd he defined information not as data, but as _a difference which makes a difference_—something relational, something that only exists in the gap between contexts.\n\n### Nora Bateson: The Unseen Coalescence\n\n![Nora Bateson](docs/images/nora-bateson.jpg)\n_Photo: [NAV Sweden](https://navsweden.se/partner/nora-bateson/)_\n\nNora Bateson, Gregory's daughter, has extended this work into new territory. She asks: if \"insidious\" describes how pathology creeps up through unseen combining processes—racism, addiction, corruption—what is the word for the opposite? For how vitality, healing, and creativity coalesce in ways we cannot see?\n\nShe calls this **aphanipoiesis** (Greek: _aphanis_ = unseen, unnoticed + _poiesis_ = to bring forth).\n\n> \"The change before the change... what coalesces prior to emergence.\"\n\nThis is not hidden—it is merely out of habituated perception. Like the soil beneath a forest, teeming with relational processes while attention is caught by what stands visible above.\n\nHer key insight: _One cannot explicitly change that which is implicit._ Direct correctives fail against insidious patterns because those patterns formed in the unseen stitching between contexts—between family and economy, between education and identity, between language and expectation. To touch that realm requires tending the _about_ so that the _within_ can shift.\n\n**Warm Data** is her term for the kind of information that can hold this complexity: \"transcontextual information about the interrelationships that integrate a complex system.\" Not cold data extracted from context, but living information that shifts within the mutual learning of systems.\n\n#### Sources\n\n- [Library of Congress: Margaret Mead in Bali](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-bali.html)\n- [Library of Congress: National Character Studies](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/oneworld-char.html)\n- [Nora Bateson: Aphanipoiesis](https://journals.isss.org/index.php/jisss/article/view/3887)\n- [Nora Bateson: Warm Data](https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2017/05/28/warm-data/)\n- [International Bateson Institute](https://batesoninstitute.org)\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>More on How the Tools Practice the Philosophy</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>\n\nIt's not just that the philosophy fits the code. It's that the code started demanding the philosophy.\n\nAs these tools evolved, they stopped being just utilities for \"managing knowledge\" and became ways of **participating in a system that is learning**. The \"User\" isn't an operator; they are part of the ecology.\n\nThe rhymes have deepened into structural necessities:\n\n- **Abduction**: The logic of the system isn't deduction (proving true/false), but abduction (finding the pattern that connects). Compare and attune don't give you answers; they place two contexts side-by-side so meaning can emerge from the double description.\n- **Transcontextuality**: An idea does not follow a straight line. It meanders—from a sudden hunch while coding, to a note in research, to a concept that stabilizes weeks later. The system doesn't force a pipeline; it preserves the living thread across contexts, so you can follow the meaning wherever it leads.\n- **Aphanipoiesis (Unseen Coalescence)**: Scribe and capture assume that the most important changes happen _before_ they are explicit. They allow understanding to accumulate in the margins until it's ready to be named.\n- **Warm Data**: We don't extract \"facts\" from our work; we keep the context attached. The system doesn't show you a to-do list; it shows you **what has pull**, what is connected, and what is waiting.\n\nThis ecosystem is an attempt to build software that knows it is part of a larger mind—yours, the project's, and the connections between them. It doesn't try to organize your thinking; it tries to learn how to move with it.\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## Get Started\n\n**First:** [Install Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) (requires Claude Pro/Max, Team/Enterprise, or Console account)\n\n**Then install qino plugins** ([full instructions →](#installation)):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add qinolabs/qino-claude\n/plugin install qino@qino-claude\n```\n\n**Create your workspace:**\n\n```bash\n/qino init workspace my-workspace\n```\n\nThis creates `./my-workspace/` in your current directory with coordinated repos inside.\n\nThe skill sets up **qinoOS** — three coordinated spaces where ideas develop:\n\n- **concepts/** — where ideas stabilize\n- **research/** — before crystallization\n- **implementations/** — from concept to code\n\nStart with one space (minimal), add others as needed (standard/full). The skill detects existing structure and offers to enhance it.\n\n[See full setup options and templates →](#getting-started)\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n∴ _Creativity, learning and integration doesn't stop at the boundary of a single repository._\n\n**qinoOS** structures this as coordinated workspaces—a living network of **concepts, research, and implementations** that evolve together. Each space offers a way to learn from anything and contribute to your ecology of ideas in the moment spontaneous insight occurs.\n\n∴ _Return your attention to what inspires you right now. Let the system take care of the rest. Things naturally surface when they're ready._\n\n<br>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>qinoOS: An Ecology of Mind</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>\n\n![Tools, apps, community](docs/images/ecosystem-arcs.png)\n\nEcological design patterns are alive at every level — in each concept, in each repository, in the ecosystem itself. The art is in the design — affordances and cues, sensitive to experience, that naturally protect the integrity of local ecologies while encouraging free movement without accumulating friction.\n\nWhat does accumulate are learnings and notes, either woven into existing concepts, or safely kept, ready to reveal itself fully through the next idea that connects. The best ideas can come from anywhere — not centralized — and often while deeply immersed in a different context.\n\n**The qino-protocol** makes this coordination possible. Concepts, research, and implementations share a common structure: graphs of nodes, each with identity and story, connected by edges that carry context. The same protocol reader works across all three spaces. The same gestures — capture, explore, annotate — mean the same thing everywhere. What differs is vocabulary, not shape.\n\n**qino-lab** is the collaboration surface where human and AI think together through this structure. The terminal and the browser become equal surfaces: what the agent annotates appears in the graph; what you edit in files appears to the agent. _(See [Lab](#lab--the-collaboration-surface) for how this works.)_\n\n### Figures: The Pattern of Return\n\n_Figure_ in qino is a metaphor — in Bateson's sense, not the literary sense. Not a stored form, but a pattern that emerges through encounters. Identity is resonance, not reference.\n\nWhat does this mean in practice?\n\n- **In the apps:** Each meeting with Elena in Walk is a **manifestation** — a local presence, mutable, owned by that context. But Elena herself is the pattern you recognize across manifestations: the **figure**. No single encounter *is* the figure; the figure is what you recognize across the trail of encounters.\n- **In the chronicles:** Seren, Lira, the wanderer — each a presence in that world. But the figure is larger: what persists when Seren appears in different chapters, different pressures.\n- **In concepts:** The thread you notice connecting one idea to another — not because you traced it, but because it kept appearing until you couldn't unsee it.\n\nSame pattern, completely different shape in each context. The gesture is fractal — it works at every scale. You don't deduce your way to this recognition — you're deep in the scribe, refining how Seren sees the wanderer, and suddenly you recognize something about how figures should work across the apps. The crab teaches you about the lobster. One context illuminates another through pattern, not logic.\n\n_(See also: [Figure Ecology](#ecological-testing) — how we test that a figure can be re-entered and still feel like \"the same thing\" after change.)_\n\n_(For the full vocabulary — manifestation, encounter, substrate, lens, voicing — see [qino Domain Language](https://github.com/qinolabs/concepts-repo/blob/main/ecosystem/qino-domain-language.md).)_\n\nThe tools are also the process for developing the apps — and in turn, the tools and apps keep informing each other. A co-evolution. They share design patterns: affordances that guide without forcing, structures that adapt to context while staying recognizable.\n\n> _\"From wherever you approach the system, every experience contains all the others. Communication comes effortlessly. The membrane grows thin — without dissolving into sameness.\"_\n\n### The Spaces\n\nAn early hunch needs room to wander — structure would crush it. A maturing concept needs stability — too much flux and it never settles. An implementation needs grounding — a vision to build toward without getting lost in features.\n\nqinoOS scaffolds these as coordinated workspaces. Each has its own quality — what it welcomes, what it protects, what it makes possible.\n\n---\n\n**Research** is where you don't have to know yet.\n\nSomething is surfacing. You can feel it before you can name it. Research gives that feeling a place to accumulate without demanding clarity too soon.\n\nHere, uncertainty is welcome. An inquiry might follow three threads at once. A quality might refuse to sharpen for weeks. An arc might span a dozen sessions before revealing what it was actually about. That's not failure — that's the space working.\n\n_What it makes possible:_ Staying with emergence. Protecting what isn't ready to be named. Noticing patterns that only become visible over time.\n\n---\n\n**Concepts** is where what was circling finds its shape.\n\nAn idea that kept returning across different contexts. A note that finally connects to other notes. A thread that now feels complete enough to hold.\n\nConcepts isn't where ideas arrive fully formed — it's where they settle. What you capture from research, what surfaces during implementation, what you recognize across encounters: all of it accumulates here, weaves together, and becomes something you can return to.\n\n_What it makes possible:_ Giving shape to what has pull. Building a body of work that grows through accretion. Making the implicit explicit — but only when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation** is where ideas meet the world.\n\nNot just code — any form of making real. The friction of materials. The feedback of use. The discoveries that only emerge when you try to build something and the world pushes back.\n\nImplementation stays connected to its concept. Drift is expected — what you learn while building often changes what you thought you wanted to build. The tools help track this, so concept and implementation evolve together.\n\n_What it makes possible:_ Grounding vision without losing it. Learning what a concept actually means when it has to work. Feeding real-world observations back into understanding.\n\n---\n\n**qino-claude** is where the tools themselves live.\n\nNot a workspace you work in daily — the workshop that equips all the others. Plugins, agents, the references that shape how they see. When you invoke `/qino` from any space, the intelligence comes from here.\n\n---\n\nMovement between spaces happens naturally. You notice something while building — capture sends it to concepts. An inquiry crystallizes — it becomes something to build. A concept needs refinement — attune opens a quality exploration in research.\n\nArcs span all of it. You can open an arc while deep in implementation, and it still accumulates in research — the pattern you're tracking doesn't care which repo you're in. The arc follows the thread, not the file structure. _(See [Arcs](#arcs--holding-what-cant-yet-be-named) for how this works.)_\n\nWhat stays constant is the gesture — capture, explore, test, attune. What changes is what that gesture *means*. The same word, shaped by where you are. Capture in research becomes a fragment feeding an inquiry. Capture in implementation sends a note back to concepts. The tools stay the same; context shapes what they do.\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\nWhat happens in the ecosystem becomes story. Git changes, transformed into fantasy narrative.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Stories of an Evolving Ecosystem chronicling itself</strong><br>(click to expand)</summary>\n\nEach repository in the qino ecosystem tells its own story.\n\n**qino-claude** — Claude-based AI tooling.\n\n> _The wanderer pressed her ear to the workshop wall.

The lab is where you think together.\n\nqino-lab is a shared visual surface — a graph of nodes rendered in the browser while you work in the terminal. Both human and AI read and write the same files. Annotations appear in real-time. Git tracks everything. What one surface writes, both surfaces see.\n\nThis isn't a dashboard or documentation system. It's the **medium of dialogue** — where thinking happens visibly, not where it gets summarized afterward.\n\n![qino-lab root view — workspaces, sessions, and signals needing attention](docs/images/lab/qino-lab-root.png)\n\n![Graph view — nodes connected by edges, with session detail](docs/images/lab/qino-lab-graph.png)\n\n![Rich node detail — story content, agent signals, and journal](docs/images/lab/qino-lab-rich-node-detail.png)\n\n### The qino-protocol\n\nThe protocol defines a universal structure for human-AI workspaces:\n\n```\nworkspace/\n  .claude/qino-config.json     # Workspace identity and vocabulary\n  graph.json                   # Nodes and edges — the visible structure\n  journal.md                   # Running trail — both surfaces write here\n  nodes/\n    {node-name}/\n      node.json                # Identity (title, type, status)\n      story.md                 # Why this exists — the impulse\n      content/                 # What this node holds\n      annotations/             # Agent signals attached here\n```\n\n**Why a protocol matters:** Concepts, research, and implementation share the same structural language. A concept node looks like a research node looks like an implementation node. The vocabulary differs — a concept has \"glowing connections,\" an implementation has \"iterations\" — but the shape is the same. This enables tools that work across all three spaces.\n\n**Affordances at every level:**\n- **File level** — Human edits `story.md` directly; agent uses `write_annotation` tool. Same files, different entry points.\n- **UI level** — Human navigates the graph visually; agent embeds deeplinks in chat. Same destination, different paths.\n- **Protocol level** — Structure scales organically. Add a node, the graph grows. Nest a graph inside a node, sub-structure emerges. No migrations, no schema changes.\n\n### Signals — How the Agent Speaks Through the Graph\n\nWhen the agent works, it writes annotations with signal types:\n\n| Signal | When | What it means |\n|--------|------|---------------|\n| `proposal` | Before acting | \"I'm about to try this — redirect me if needed\" |\n| `tension` | When something surprises | \"This doesn't fit what we expected\" |\n| `reading` | After interpreting | \"Here's what I see in this material\" |\n| `connection` | When nodes relate | \"This echoes what's over there\" |\n\nThe UI renders these with visual weight that matches their urgency. Tensions surface prominently. Readings collapse by default. Proposals appear as cards awaiting response.\n\nThe agent's thinking becomes visible *as it happens*. You watch the graph — not to review documentation, but to participate in the thinking.\n\n### Navigators | Cross-Context Orientation\n\nSome work spans multiple contexts — an implementation that touches three apps, a concept that bridges research and building, an inquiry that keeps surfacing while you code.\n\nNavigators are living orientation documents for this kind of trans-contextual work:\n\n```\nnavigators/\n  emergence-lab.md    # Terrain map, reading order, open questions, session log\n```\n\nA navigator holds:\n- **Terrain** — What's here, what connects, what to read first\n- **Open questions** — What remains unresolved\n- **Session log** — Accumulated observations across sessions\n\nUnlike arcs (which follow emergence as it unfolds), navigators **map terrain for building**. They orient construction across contexts without prescribing tasks.\n\nActivate with: \"use the active navigator\", \"navigate [territory]\", \"map this concept\"\n\n### Views | Composed Attention\n\nSometimes the full graph is too broad. Sometimes a single node loses relational context. Views are curated subsets — \"think about these things together.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"the-naming-tension\",\n  \"type\": \"view\",\n  \"view\": {\n    \"focal\": \"crossing-threshold\",\n    \"includes\": [\"domain-language\", \"qino-world\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA view has a **focal node** (the primary subject) and **included nodes** (what to attend to alongside). The UI renders just this subset. The graph stays navigable but attention stays composed.\n\nViews are ephemeral. When an inquiry resolves, the view can be composted — it served its purpose. What remains is the understanding, not the frame.\n\n### Lab Mode in Practice\n\n```\n(you)   use the lab\n\n(qino)                  lab mode active\n\n        UI: http://localhost:4020\n\n        workspace: sound-lab\n        nodes: 12 nodes, 8 edges\n\n        ─────────────────────────────────────────\n\n        annotations will appear in real-time as I work\n\n        you watch the graph — I'll surface:\n          tension     when something doesn't fit\n          reading     when I interpret what I see\n          proposal    before I try something new\n          connection  when nodes relate\n```\n\nThe conversation continues in chat. But findings, proposals, and tensions appear in the graph. When the agent says \"see the tension in emergent-path,\" it's a clickable link — navigation from chat to graph is seamless.\n\n**The shift:** The agent doesn't explain what you can see. The graph shows it. Chat provides context and decisions. The visual artifact carries the thinking.\n\n_[Lab workflow](plugins/qino/skills/qino/workflows/lab.md)_\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n## Concept\n\nWhere ideas come before code. Giving shape to what has pull — exploring possibilities before committing to implementation.\n\n_From concept's view: Ideas sometimes arrive from [Research](#research) — an inquiry that crystallized enough to become something to build. When a concept is ready, [Implementation](#implementation) carries it forward. And [Story](#story) shows what becomes of it in the world._\n\n### qino | Giving Shape to What Has Pull\n\nA gentle space for giving shape to what already has pull.\n\n#### Discovery through dialogue\n\nMost tools assume you can get to a valuable output by filling in the sections — complete the template, check the boxes, and the result will follow. Templates assume structure produces resonance.\n\nThis assumes resonance guides structure. It asks what draws you, follows that thread, asks again. Each response surfaces something — a connection you hadn't named, a quality you were circling around, a direction that suddenly feels right. You discover what your idea actually holds by staying with it, turning it gently, going deeper where it rewards attention.\n\n#### Nothing gets lost\n\nWhen you bring in a note, not everything makes it into your concept. The rest isn't lost — it's held. Each thought is captured as a note with its relevant context preserved, quietly indexed, ready to surface when it matters. No guilt about what you didn't carry forward. Later, if you're stuck, the tool might say: _\"There's something held in your origins — about [that theme]. Should we bring it in?\"_\n\nIt remembers what you set down so you can forget safely. _(This is capture in action — ideas appearing from the held archive.)_\n\n#### Explore\n\nYou turn toward a concept to develop it. qino helps you follow what carries energy — the _alive thread_.\n\n```\n(you)   explore qino-scribe\n\n(qino)  qino-scribe\n        grounding in story, writing tools, git-as-chronicle\n\n        Last touch: 2 days ago\n        Active thread: \"the membrane between the wanderer and the reader\"\n\n        There is also a new note from yesterday:\n        \"git-weather-pattern\" (captured from research)\n\n        What part of this feels alive right now?\n\n(you)   the way code churn feels like weather. a big refactor should feel like a storm.\n\n(qino)  That's a strong impulse — code changes aren't just metadata, they are \"Disturbance.\"\n\n        If we follow that... does this belong in \"Ecosystem Integration\"?\n        Or is this a \"new Glowing Connection\"?\n\n(you)   it's a glowing connection. the git diff becomes world behavior.\n\n(qino)  Adding that to Glowing Connections.\n\n        \"The git diff becomes world behavior. Code churn translates into storms,\n         stuck doors, or sudden clearings.\"\n\n        Does that change how we read the repository?\n```\n\n#### Import and capture\n\n- **import** brings outside notes into the manifest. What you don't carry into a concept gets held; home surfaces those held threads later.\n- **explore** turns toward one concept (or two at once) and follows the alive thread.

You arrive afterward.\n\n#### The room after\n\nYou launch it, then enter the room after it happened. Chairs still warm. Ideas still in the air. You discover what emerged — the questions they kept circling back to, what they couldn't resolve.\n\nSix perspectives think through words. The seventh (World) thinks through environment — a draft scatters someone's diagrams; they gather them differently and that's when the insight arrives. _(World doesn't speak — it acts. See: [Narrator Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing).)_\n\n#### What you find\n\n```\ndesign-sprints/2024-12-15_collaboration-vs-focus/\n├── __enter-here.md\n├── dialogue.md\n├── q-what-signals-legitimate-interruption.md\n├── q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md\n├── q-who-decides-when-to-break-flow.md\n└── synthesis.md\n```\n\nFrom `q-can-focus-be-collaborative.md`:\n\n> **The Skeptic:** We keep saying \"focus time\" as if it's always solo.

Scribe transforms git into fantasy chronicle; Relay voices research for newcomers; Lens provides the perceptual frameworks both draw from.\n\n_These capabilities are consolidated in the `qino-prose` plugin (Scribe, Relay, Lens)._\n\n_From story's view: [Implementation](#implementation) generates the commits that Scribe transforms. [Research](#research) provides the arcs that Relay transmits. Both draw perceptual frameworks from Lens — and [Concept](#concept) work shapes the world that gives the story its ground._\n\n### qino Scribe | Git Becomes Story\n\nqino Scribe keeps the chronicle alive. It reads the git range, grounds in `world.md`, then writes a chapter where the wanderer acts and the world pushes back. The constraints are there to protect story craft: pressure before plot, world that sees the wanderer, action that costs something.\n\nIn this repository's chronicle, the wanderer is ferrying a warming pouch upriver. Villages know about them before they arrive. Lira at Orith's Landing recognizes the pouch from years ago; Seren fears the writing filling his margins; the river itself carries news. The chronicle only moves when the wanderer does — and when the world answers.\n\n#### A Chronicle That Accumulates\n\nYour ecosystem evolves through conversations and work that spans sessions. qino Scribe turns that movement into a fantasy chronicle that **gathers weight**. It doesn't just append new chapters; it remembers what has been seen, what remains unspoken, and how the world has been watching.\n\n#### Three-Agent Architecture\n\nChapters emerge through staged handoffs between specialized agents:\n\n**Prep Agent** — Reads the world state, git changes, and recent chapters. Through three interactive checkpoints (scene seeds → world behavior → story lens), it builds `prep.md`: a constraint document that captures what to write and how to perceive, without carrying the full context forward.\n\n**Prose Agent** — Receives *only* `prep.md` and `world-seed.md`. This hard cut forces fresh invention — no recycled descriptions, no context to lean on. The constraint breeds originality.\n\n**Editorial Agent** — Sees *only* the draft chapter, not the prep that shaped it. Evaluates execution against craft patterns. Returns specific line-level feedback or approval.\n\nThe architecture protects what matters: prep shapes without dictating, prose invents within constraints, editorial evaluates blind to intention. Each agent does one thing well.\n\n#### Theme as Seed\n\nThe theme establishes the generative grammar — the key signature, atmosphere's origin. But the chronicle grows beyond it. New locations emerge, characters surface, mysteries compound.\n\nContinuity lives in `world.md` and `arcs.md`. The theme is where it started; the chronicle is where it's going.\n\n#### The World's Disturbance\n\nThe Disturbance Layer is more than just the world responding to changes in the source material. It is a space that creates a special relationship between the reader and the wanderer.\n\nWhen you act, the world reacts. A bug isn't just a failure; it's a gate rusted shut. A lost gap isn't just an error; it's a map torn away by a whiteout wind. This responsiveness establishes the **contextual density** of the chronicle, but the core of the layer is relational.\n\n#### The Wanderer's Presence\n\nThe wanderer carries a depth no single world can hold. They are not oblivious to the world beyond (your source material), but they do not voice it. This silence creates a bond of recognition and trust.\n\nThey are defined not by power, but by **exposure**. They can be hurt, confused, or wrong.\n\n> **The Injury** — The knife slipped. The cold had stolen the feeling from their fingers, so they only felt the warmth of the blood first. It hit the snow in bright, steaming drops. The wanderer dropped the wood and pressed their palm into the drift, counting the seconds until the numbness returned.\n\n> **The Gate** — The wind screamed through the iron. The lock was a solid lump of oxidation. The wanderer didn't rattle it. They let their hand drop, the cold lingering on their glove, and turned their back to the wind.\n\n> **The Map** — The wind tore the map from their hands. It was gone before they could take a step. The wanderer didn't waste heat shouting. They turned their collar up and kept walking.\n\nThey do not fight the world, but they also do not detach from it. They simply inhabit the moment with full attention.\n\n**What the wanderer notices** — the weight lifting when the pack comes off, the warmth of blood before the cut registers, the cold lingering on a glove — models what the reader might notice. The wanderer's quality of attention becomes an entry point for the reader's own.\n\n**Familiar and strange.** The wanderer is always relatable — they feel cold, get tired, make mistakes. But through that familiarity, something gently shifted becomes visible. Not superhuman perception, just what unfolds when attention stays present with consequence. The reader feels what becomes available when attention doesn't rush past the moment.\n\nThe invitation is implicit: _this quality of being is available to you too_.\n\n#### Mutual Revealing\n\nThe central principle of the chronicle is **mutual revealing**: through the implicit response of one entity to the action (or inaction) of another, something is revealed about each.\n\nThis applies to everything in the world, not just the wanderer. When a merchant refuses a coin, the refusal reveals the coin's worth _and_ the merchant's fear. When the fog swallows a sound, it reveals the fog's density _and_ the sound's fragility. Meaning emerges from the friction between things.\n\n#### Story Lenses\n\nEach chapter is written through a story lens — a perceptual mode that shapes what the prose agent notices. The lens determines which sensitivities to foreground: what to attend to, what to let recede.\n\n| Lens | The Question |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Arrival** | What if this chapter is about being received? |\n| **Journey** | What if this chapter leaves known ground? |\n| **Return** | What if we come back to where we've been? |\n| **Discovery** | What if something hidden comes to light? |\n| **Confrontation** | What if something must be faced? |\n| **Crisis** | What if the pressure breaks now? |\n| **Loss** | What if something or someone departs? |\n| **Vigil** | What if action is impossible and presence is all? |\n| **Ritual** | What if a cultural form holds the chapter? |\n| **Complication** | What if the change creates a problem? |\n| **Work** | What if this chapter is about making together? |\n| **Gathering** | What if multiple threads convene? |\n\nEach lens foregrounds specific sensitivities from [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing). The Arrival lens foregrounds Newcomer's Eyes — everything noticed, nothing normalized. The Journey lens foregrounds Companion's Lens — world filtered through who you travel with.\n\nAt the directions checkpoint, the prep agent presents three lenses that fit the current moment. You choose which perceptual mode shapes the chapter.\n\n#### Complete Transformation\n\nThe chronicle must work for a reader who has never heard of the source material. Technical names never leak into the prose. `AuthService` becomes \"the gatekeeper's ledger.\" A database migration becomes \"preservation efforts in the archives.\" The story guards its own reality.\n\n#### How chapters take shape\n\nAt each layer, the scribe presents options. You choose — or combine, adjust, ask for more. Options are vocabulary; even rejected ones help articulate what's wanted.\n\n```\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\ngrounding\n\n  theme       brown water, green distance, rope bridges swaying\n  pressure    the pouch warming toward soon\n  arc         The Wanderer's Hands — something in how they hold things\n  last seen   sitting at Orith's Landing, feet over water, eating dark bread\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nscene seeds\n\n  1 → Deren notices the wanderer's raw hands — fifteen years of\n      calluses meeting someone who rows like they're outrunning something\n\n  2 → Lira appears at the platform edge — she knew the pouch before,\n      years ago, going the other way\n\n  3 → A child watches from the rope bridge — the same stillness as\n      Seren, that quality of recording without approaching\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n[ 1-3 ] or adjust    [ > ] auto-pick    [ >> ] start writing\n```\n\n_[Source](plugins/qino-prose/)_\n\n<br>\n\n### qino Relay | Bridging to Readers\n\nSharing research with readers who weren't there.\n\n#### Two bridges, different crossings\n\nScribe and Relay solve the same problem differently: making internal work accessible to readers who weren't there.\n\n| | Scribe | Relay |\n|---|--------|-------|\n| **Source** | Git commits | Research arcs |\n| **Voice** | The wanderer in a fictional world | The Student as reader companion |\n| **Transformation** | Complete — code becomes weather, bugs become stuck gates | Partial — arc structure stays visible, material gets grounded |\n| **Reader experience** | Story that stands alone | Learning alongside someone who knows the way |\n| **Prep layer** | Yes (commits → story material) | Reader journey notes |\n| **Figure's memory** | None across chapters | Learns across transmissions |\n\nScribe transforms completely. A reader never sees `AuthService` — they see \"the gatekeeper's ledger.\" The chronicle guards its own reality.\n\nRelay preserves structure. The arc's chain remains recognizable — dates, connections, what emerged. But the Student walks alongside a reader encountering it, asking their questions, making abstract concrete.\n\nBoth draw from [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing) for perceptual framing — Scribe through story lenses that shape chapter attention, Relay through the Student's quality of reader companionship.\n\n#### The Student\n\nThe Student receives transmissions on a device. The soft chime is familiar; the routine of reading and thinking is something they enjoy.\n\n**What the Student notices** — a phrase that won't let go, a question that existed before they arrived, the moment something clicks — models what the reader might notice. The Student's quality of attention becomes an entry point for the reader's own.\n\n> *\"Meaning-searching versus meaning-finding.\"*\n>\n> *I keep coming back to that phrase. There's something in the hyphen. In one case you're hunting. In the other, you're receiving.*\n>\n> *The counterintuitive part: we usually think directness is better. Want someone to understand? Point at it. Label it.*\n>\n> *But here's what happened. The first design put abstract categories on a map. You could see exactly what you were navigating. And it felt dead.*\n\nThe Student encounters research material — stopped by a turn of phrase, surprised by a connection, sitting with what can't yet be resolved. The reader witnesses this and finds their own attention shaped by it.\n\n**The parallel.** There's a movement of metaphor between the Student's experience and the reader's reading. The Student meets emergence on their device; the reader meets the transmission on theirs. What the Student does with the material — how they hold difficulty, where they let questions stay open — shows the reader how they might hold it too.\n\n**Familiar and strange.** The Student is always relatable — they get stuck, they're uncertain, they don't have all the answers. But through that familiarity, something gently shifted becomes visible. Not a lecture about attention, just a figure who *is* attending: staying with a phrase, letting a question breathe, noticing when something lands. The reader feels what becomes available when attention doesn't rush past difficulty.\n\nThe invitation is implicit: *this quality of being is available to you too*.\n\n**The Student's world.** The library with its quiet, the café with afternoon noise, the balcony at dusk — these aren't backdrop. They're where quality of attention becomes visible. A grounded, warm place that holds thinking. The reader feels: *this is how demanding material can be approached*.\n\n#### Two figures, two qualities\n\nThe wanderer notices the weight lift from their shoulders when they set down the pack. They notice warmth before they feel the cut. Not superhuman — just what unfolds when attention stays present with consequence. The reader, witnessing this, learns a quality of attention for story: *meet what comes*.\n\nThe Student notices what stops them, what arrives from outside. They voice difficulty rather than resolving it. Not expertise — just what unfolds when attention stays with the demanding. The reader, witnessing this, learns a quality of attention for research: *stay curious with what's hard*.\n\nBoth balance familiar and strange. Both create entry points — invitations into a quality of being that the reader recognizes as possible for themselves.\n\n**Implicit mystery.** The Student treats their device as ordinary. They don't question where transmissions come from. This ease creates wonder — but the Student doesn't carry that question. The reader does.\n\nThe Student is not described, not named. The gap lets readers step into their body.\n\n_[Source](plugins/qino-prose/)_\n\n<br>\n\n![qino Journal — transmission view](docs/images/journal/transmission-view.png)\n\n> _\"What makes this hard to explain is the recursion. The qino-lens:narrator tool — once it existed — was used to refine the documentation that explains the tool. The thing being made helped explain how to make it. This sounds circular. But I am not sure it is. Something about the tool shaping the hands that shape the tool.\"_\n>\n> — From a journal transmission on Qualities of Attention\n\n**[Read the journal →](https://journal.qinolabs.com/)**\n\n<br>\n\n### qino Lens | Ways of Seeing\n\nStyle resists decoration. It is not paint applied to surface; it is a **quality of attention**. A shift in _what is noticed_.\n\nqino-lens pushed its way out of the work. Scribe needed to see the world differently—to perceive friction where there was only plot, to sense agency where there was only setting. I didn't design a library; I extracted the ways of seeing that the chronicle demanded.\n\nThese are prose-level lenses — language-based sensitivities that shape text, not the full apps-layer infrastructure where lenses voice substrate into facets. But the domain language term fits: a lens is a **relational sensitivity**, a way of resonating with specific patterns. The prose lenses test that idea in text before it becomes application code.\n\n_(Note: I used the narrator lens that emerged from this process to refine this very section — the tool shaping the documentation that explains the tool.)_\n\nThe chronicle changes depending on who watches it. These lenses accumulate — discovered through the work, not designed in advance:\n\n#### `narrator` — World as Participant\n\n- **Sensitivity:** Physics, Agency, Structural Agency.\n- **The World Acts:** The fog doesn't just hang; it _withholds_. The room doesn't just contain; it _shapes_.\n- **The Construction:** This lens ensures the world is solid enough to push back.\n\n> _Example:_ \"The corridor didn't just lead to the chamber; it constricted. The ceiling dropped low, forcing a bow, while the walls leaned in to strip away any thought of turning back. The architecture demanded submission before arrival.\"\n\n_([Reference](plugins/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/narrator.md))_\n\n#### `wanderer` — Sensitivity to Friction\n\n- **Sensitivity:** Exposure, Consequence, Absence of Abstraction.\n- **The Body Knows:** It notices not the beauty of the ice, but the _numbness_ in the fingers. Not the meaning of silence, but its _weight_.\n- **The Inhabitation:** This lens grounds high fantasy in immediate physical cost.\n\n> _Example:_ \"The fog pressed against the river, a heavy, wet burden. The ferry wasn't coming. The wanderer unbuckled the strap and slid the pack down the piling, guiding it until it touched the wet wood. They straightened. The sudden lightness made them sway, their shoulders rising into the damp space where the straps had been.\"\n\n_([Reference](plugins/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/wanderer.md))_\n\n#### `newcomer` — Finding What's Become Invisible\n\n- **Sensitivity:** What inhabitants have stopped seeing.\n- **The Question:** What would someone notice on their first day here that locals walk past without a glance?\n- **The Craft:** The dwelling is the noticing. Don't explain that others don't see — let the prose linger. The reader feels the strangeness through the attention given to it.\n\n> _Example:_ \"The oldest woman at the table was served last. Plates circled toward younger faces. She waited, hands folded. When her plate came, she lifted her fork. Then the others began to eat.\"\n\n_([Reference](plugins/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/newcomer.md))_\n\n#### `companion` — World Through Relationship\n\n- **Sensitivity:** How companionship shapes perception.\n- **What Changes:** Attention splits between world and person. Things get pointed out. Things get avoided. Silence gains texture. Pace synchronizes — or doesn't.\n- **The Craft:** Show relationship through action, not description. Don't label emotional shifts — embody them in what characters do.\n\n> _Example:_ \"Varo stopped at a stall. Copper bowls, dented. She picked one up, ran her thumb across a dent. 'My mother had one like this.' Set it back. Moved on. The wanderer lifted the same bowl, found the dent, felt where her thumb had been.\"\n\n_([Reference](plugins/qino-prose/references/qino-lens/companion.md))_\n\n_[Source](plugins/qino-prose/)_\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\nFrom concept to working code. When exploration has found its shape, implementation carries it forward.\n\n_From implementation's view: [Concept](#concept) is the guiding force — what to build and why. The commits generated here become [Story](#story) material through Scribe. [Research](#research) findings sometimes inform technical decisions._\n\n### Building from Concepts\n\nImplementation companion for concept work.\n\n#### What gets lost in building\n\nYou start with a vision. Then the practical demands come — the requirements, the task lists, the \"just ship it\" pressure. Requirements dilute it. Tickets fragment it. Urgency erases it. Somewhere in the building, the feeling fades into features.\n\nThis happens when concept and implementation share the same space. Without boundaries, one absorbs the other — and implementation always wins. The code is right there, immediate and demanding.\n\nqino gives them separate places. Your concept stays in concepts-repo. Your implementation lives in the target project. Not to keep them apart, but so they can inform each other without merging. The concept shapes what you build. What you discover while building flows back to shape the concept. Each keeps its own form while the other grows.\n\n#### From concept to code\n\nWhen you initialize from a concept, the work isn't to rediscover what you already know. It's to translate.\n\nGiven this essence, what technologies serve it? Given these surfaces, what architecture patterns? Given this scope, what complexity budget? What would signal we're on track — or off it?\n\nA fifteen-minute conversation translates conceptual understanding into technical context. What emerges is an `implementation.md` that knows what it's building toward and why certain choices fit better than others.\n\n#### Arrival\n\nThe generated app command follows the home pattern. Quiet arrival. Show what's here. Open to what's next.\n\n```\nmy-app\n\nconcept — linked to board-games\nstack — React, Supabase, shadcn/ui\niteration — 01: foundation — in progress\n\n─────\n\nfrom here\n\n  two of three goals done in this iteration\n  what's blocking the last one?\n\n  there's uncommitted work on authentication\n  continue here, or commit what you have?\n\n                        just respond, or explore board-games\n```\n\nNot a dashboard. Not a menu. A place to arrive before you work.\n\n#### Building in phases\n\nIterations aren't sprints. They're checkpoints for turn-taking.\n\nAI implements to the iteration spec. User tests and reviews. Feedback flows before the next phase begins. Each iteration has scope, goals, and test criteria — clear enough to build toward, flexible enough to learn from.\n\nThe files live in `implementations/` — visible, version-controlled, yours. Not hidden in `.claude/`. Not abstracted away. You can read them, edit them, understand what's planned.\n\n#### Drift detection\n\nBuilding reveals truths that concept exploration couldn't predict. Sometimes the domain model doesn't fit. Sometimes features need adding or removing. Sometimes technical constraints force conceptual compromises.\n\nThe dev agent notices these moments and offers to update the concept — keeping concept and implementation in sync as understanding evolves.\n\n**Two directions of drift:**\n\n| Direction | When it happens | What the dev agent does |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Implementation → Concept | You discover something while building | Recognizes drift signals, offers to update concept |\n| Concept → Implementation | Concept evolves after implementation started | Shows what changed on arrival, offers to reconcile |\n\n**Drift signals during building:**\n\nWhen you say things like \"actually let's call it X instead of Y\" or \"we should also add this feature\" — the dev agent recognizes these as concept-level changes:\n\n```\n(you)   Actually, \"Match\" should be \"Session\" — it's not competitive.\n\n(dev)   That's a domain model shift — the concept still uses \"Match.\"\n\n        This looks like a concept-level change.\n\n        • update concept — invoke concept agent to make the change\n        • note for later — capture as observation\n        • continue — stay in implementation\n```\n\nIf you choose \"update concept,\" the dev agent invokes the concept agent with context about what changed. The concept agent makes the edit, then control returns to dev context.\n\n**Concept changes on arrival:**\n\nWhen you return to an implementation after the linked concept has evolved:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ my-app                                  │\n│                                         │\n│ concept — updated since last check      │\n│ board-games                             │\n│ modified 2 days ago                     │\n│                                         │\n│ what changed                            │\n│ + Timer feature (new in scoped features)│\n│ ~ \"Match\" → \"Session\" (entity renamed)  │\n│                                         │\n│ iteration                               │\n│ 02: core-features — in progress         │\n│                                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nThe linked concept evolved. Want to:\n  • review — see what changed in detail\n  • reconcile — update iteration plan if needed\n  • acknowledge — sync timestamp, continue as-is\n```\n\n**Iteration checkpoints:**\n\nAt the end of each iteration, before moving to the next, the dev agent asks about concept-level learnings — a natural moment to surface what building revealed.\n\n_[Source](plugins/qino/)_\n\n<br>\n\n## Research\n\nResearch is pre-concept work — following threads before they crystallize. The research workspace holds inquiries, qualities, and arcs. Compare and Attune are methods for perceiving difference.\n\n_From research's view: What crystallizes here might become [Concept](#concept) material. Arcs feed [Story](#story) through Relay. Research methods — Compare for finding difference, Attune for refining perception — work across all domains._\n\n### Following Threads\n\nA space for open-ended research — before ideas become concepts. Three experiential types, each with its own relationship to uncertainty:\n\n- **Inquiries** — Open-ended following of threads. A question that stays alive across sessions. Sustained longitudinal threads (weeks/months).\n- **Qualities** — Refining aesthetic sensibilities into speakable craft. _(See [Attune](#attune--from-hunch-to-craft).)_\n- **Arcs** — Active containers for emergence. Open when you notice something surfacing, close when ready to capture. Sessions accumulate while the arc is live. _(See [Arcs](#arcs--active-containers-for-emergence).)_\n\nThe distinction: inquiries follow a question over time; arcs hold convergence across threads while it's happening. Both live in the research workspace. Both contribute to understanding. But their rhythms differ.\n\nUnlike concepts (which stabilize over time), research moves fast, welcomes uncertainty, and accepts inconclusive results as valuable data.\n\n#### What accumulates\n\nAn inquiry without conclusions is still valuable — it maps the territory. Arcs don't need maintenance — they're evidence of ecosystem participation. They accumulate as ecosystem memory.\n\n_[Source](plugins/qino/)_\n\n<br>\n\n### Arcs | Holding What Can't Yet Be Named\n\nSomething is moving through you. It shapes how you think, informs the bias of your attention, appears across contexts without being summoned. But it doesn't have a name yet. It's not ready to be categorized.\n\nThe danger: **naming it too early kills it**. Forcing a shape before the pattern has found its own shape stops the natural unfolding in its tracks.\n\nArcs protect against this.\n\n#### The container that doesn't demand\n\nMost systems ask: *What is this? What type? Where does it go?* That pressure — even gentle pressure — collapses what's forming. The ripple that was finding its own shape gets frozen into whatever category was available.\n\nAn arc says something different: *I notice something is moving. I won't ask what it is yet.*\n\nYou open an arc with a provisional gesture — \"something about how containers work across the ecosystem\" — evocative, not definitive. The ecosystem holds space: sessions link automatically, pointers accumulate as work touches territory. No forced structure. No premature naming.\n\nThe crystallization comes at closure, or not at all. Some arcs stay open for months. Some close with useful confusion. That's not failure — that's respecting the vulnerability of emergence.\n\n#### Making the unnamed speakable\n\nWhat arcs enable: a powerful pattern that moves through you — informing your thinking, shaping your attention — becomes **visible, speakable, intelligible**. Not because you forced it into language, but because you held space while it found its own.\n\nThe arc format supports this:\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Ground** | Why this had energy. The charge you felt before you could explain it. |\n| **The Recurring** | The pattern that kept appearing — across concept work, implementation, research. |\n| **The Between** | The quality of connection. Why things felt related before you knew why. |\n| **What Composted** | Before → After. What shifted in understanding. |\n| **Seeds** | What remains alive — questions to carry forward. |\n\nNot a journey from question to answer. An ecology — ground that gave it life, patterns that recurred, transformations that happened.\n\n#### An arc noticing itself\n\nFrom the research archive — an arc that captured the recursive quality:\n\n> *While capturing an arc about sensing, the capture itself became the subject. Dimensions were under-noticed. When asked \"what did you miss?\", something shifted: not just filling gaps, but seeing that the format itself was weak.*\n>\n> *The charge: a system meant to hold emergence was under-sensing emergence. The container needed to become an expression of what it holds.*\n\nThe pattern appeared at three levels: sensing quality in content, sensing quality in format, recognizing that a system for noticing can itself under-notice. The same bootstrap problem, recursively applied.\n\nWhat composted:\n> Journey metaphor (items, sequence, destination) → Ecology metaphor (ground, pattern, connection, transformation)\n\nWhat remained as seed:\n> *The question \"what did you miss?\" could be a reusable instrument. Not telling what's wrong — inviting noticing.*\n\n#### The difference that makes a difference\n\nArcs don't capture facts. They capture what *moved* — what changed perception. Bateson's definition of information: a difference that makes a difference.\n\nThe same insight appears while building, then while researching, then while exploring something else entirely. You didn't plan this. The pattern found you across contexts.\n\nThis is transcontextuality made practical. The ripple, held while it's rippling.\n\n#### What remains is capacity\n\nEach arc changes something. Not just the content discovered, but the capacity to notice. You become better at recognizing emergence while it's happening — the moment when something is moving through your attention but doesn't yet have a name.\n\n> *Arcs are questions you carry. The pattern of attention is the symptom; the question is the arc. Closure is conscious release — when the question has done its work, you choose to let it go. What remains is capacity, not content.*\n\nThe invitation: pay attention to your own attention. Notice what keeps appearing. Hold it without forcing. Let it teach you how to see.\n\n_([First arc](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-research/blob/main/arcs/2025-12-29_recognition-through-indirection.md) — the session that discovered it needed arcs)_\n\n<br>\n\n### Compare | The Parallel Mirror\n\nYou have two versions of something — chapters, outputs, designs. You know one is better, but you can't say why. Two bottlenecks stop you:\n\n**Volume** — You can't hold two chapters in working memory at once. You need someone who holds the whole, navigates strategically, and presents what's worth comparing side by side.\n\n**Expertise** — Evaluating prose requires craft knowledge. Stakes, tension, character texture, reader entry — these are dimensions you might not think to look at. The framework lends expertise you don't have.\n\nCompare solves both. You just respond. The facilitator does the navigation. The framework does the heavy lifting. By the end, you've perceived something you couldn't have seen on your own.\n\n#### Fresh reading first\n\nBefore framework, before analysis — gut response:\n\n```\n(qino)  I've read both versions.\n\n        Before we look at specifics — what stays with you?\n        What's your felt sense of how they differ?\n\n(you)   A feels more grounded. B has more happening but I drifted.\n\n(qino)  ∴ A: grounded, held attention\n        ∴ B: more activity, but attention drifted\n\n        Let's find where that difference lives.\n```\n\nYou don't construct analysis. You respond. The framework makes that response meaningful.\n\n#### The parallel mirror\n\nWhen you notice something working in one version, the facilitator finds something in the other with the same structural shape — same beat, same role, same type of element.\n\n```\n(qino)  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ you liked (from A)                                          │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ \"The river carried news of her before she arrived.\"         │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ Observation without comment. World notices wanderer.        │\n        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ parallel from B                                             │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ \"Seren watched from the doorway, cataloguing.\"              │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ Same structure — external observer, no commentary.          │\n        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n        These occupy the same position. How do they land differently?\n\n(you)   The river one feels like the world has its own life.\n        Seren watching feels like... surveillance? Character-driven.\n\n(qino)  So the difference is agency — world as participant vs.\n        world as backdrop for character perception?\n\n        ·\n```\n\nThe parallel *looks* like it should work the same way. When it doesn't, that reveals something deeper — not just a difference between passages, but a difference between the underlying logics of the two versions.\n\n#### Framework as scaffold\n\nYou might not know to look at \"reader entry\" or \"stakes distribution.\" But when the facilitator surfaces a dimension, you recognize what you're sensing:\n\n```\n(qino)  Let me try a framework lens: reader entry.\n\n        In A, the reader enters through environment — the river,\n        the news traveling. They're placed in the world first.\n\n        In B, the reader enters through Seren's perception.\n        They're placed in a character's head first.\n\n        Does that match your \"grounded vs. drifting\" sense?\n\n(you)   Yes — when I enter through the world, I'm there.\n        When I enter through a character watching, I'm watching\n        someone watch. One layer removed.\n```\n\nThe framework lends expertise. You don't need to know craft vocabulary — you just respond, and the dimension helps you name what you felt.\n\n#### When something worth calibrating emerges\n\nA compare session may surface a quality worth developing — \"something about how presence is handled\" or \"the difference between world-agency and character-agency.\"\n\nThat's a handoff to [Attune](#attune--from-hunch-to-craft):\n\n```\n(qino)  We keep returning to this: world as participant vs. backdrop.\n        This might be worth calibrating — turning it into teachable craft.\n\n        I can carry what we've found into an attune session:\n        - The quality: \"world agency\"\n        - Contrasting passages: what we've collected\n        - Initial distinctions: world notices vs. character perceives\n\n        Want to refine this into something you can teach and protect?\n```\n\nCompare surfaces. Attune sharpens. Each stands alone, but the flow enriches both.\n\n### Attune | From Hunch to Craft\n\nYou can feel when writing has \"presence\" — but you can't teach it. You notice when code is \"elegant\" — but the distinction evaporates when you try to explain it to someone else.\n\nMost of what makes creative work good is tacit — pattern recognition trained by exposure but never fully articulated. Attune creates conditions where this tacit knowledge can partially surface. Not all of it. But enough to teach, enough to protect, enough to recognize when you're drifting.\n\nThe tool follows Bateson's principle: **information is a difference that makes a difference**. Comparison does the teaching. You don't understand a quality by describing it in isolation — you understand it by feeling two examples and noticing which creates the response you're after.\n\n#### The interpretive loop\n\nMost feedback tools work like extraction: present stimulus, receive response, extract pattern. Attune works like dialogue.\n\nAfter you respond, the facilitator voices an interpretation — then pauses. That interpretation becomes a surface you can push against. The facilitator might be wrong. That's generative:\n\n```\n(qino)  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ candidate 3                                                 │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ \"The Mender looked at the wanderer's hands for a long      │\n        │  moment. Then she handed them another stack of skins.\"      │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ does this have the quality you're calibrating?              │\n        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n(you)   yes — there's something in the gap. she noticed but didn't say anything.\n\n(qino)  so the quality lives in withheld response —\n        observation that doesn't convert to speech?\n\n        ·\n\n(you)   not quite. it's more... the response IS the silence.\n        handing them more work is the acknowledgment.\n\n(qino)  ∴ action as acknowledgment — response without verbalization\n\n        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ distinction emerged                                         │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ ✓ works: response through action, not speech                │\n        │ ✗ fails: observation that stays observation                 │\n        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n        ready for the next candidate, or stay with this one?\n```\n\nThe facilitator's interpretation was wrong — \"withheld response\" wasn't quite it. But that wrongness created the condition for refinement. \"Response IS the silence\" wouldn't have emerged from the initial reaction alone.\n\n#### Space as architecture\n\nThe `·` is a pause — but it's not decoration. It's load management.\n\nWithout space, you hold three things at once: your response to the previous candidate, the facilitator's interpretation, and the new candidate demanding attention. To refine the interpretation, you'd have to reach *back* through new material. Most people don't — the cognitive cost is too high.\n\nSpace is the invitation: \"your turn. If there's more, say it now.\" If you don't push, close enough. If you do, the refinement happens in the open.\n\n#### Building distinctions\n\nAs you work through candidates, patterns accumulate:\n\n```\n(qino)  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ distinctions so far                                         │\n        │                                                             │\n        │ ✓ works                        ✗ doesn't work               │\n        │ ─────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────     │\n        │ response through action        observation stays internal   │\n        │ world notices without comment  character explains seeing    │\n        │ gap stays open                 gap gets filled with meaning │\n        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n        candidate 7 of 12\n\n        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n        │ \"The ferryman counted the coins twice.

Tables compress. They lose which example prompted which distinction, the wrong interpretations that reveal what you were *not* saying, the refinement path, the texture of response.\n\nWhen you revisit the calibration — to extend it, to teach someone else, to understand why a new case doesn't fit — you need the reasoning that produced those distinctions. The trace preserves reasoning-in-motion. The synthesis extracts for reference. Both are needed.\n\n**Trace** answers: \"How did we learn this?\"\n**Synthesis** answers: \"What did we learn?\"\n\n```\ncalibrations/unspoken-recognition/\n├── calibration.md      # trace + synthesis\n└── examples/           # the corpus you tested against\n```\n\n#### Downstream\n\nCalibrated qualities become reference material for other tools:\n\n- **qino Scribe** — what makes otherworldliness work in chronicles\n- **qino Lens** — named sensitivities that become perceptual modes\n- **Design Adventure** — qualities the World persona embodies\n\nAttune doesn't implement the qualities. It discovers and articulates them. Other tools carry them forward.\n\nWhat you could only feel, you can now teach. What you couldn't explain, you can now protect.\n\n_(The [qino Lens](#qino-lens--ways-of-seeing) section is a product of this process — the Wanderer's Lens emerged from an Attune calibration on \"embodied presence.\")_\n\n#### Epistemological Signature\n\n**[qino-lingo](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-lingo)** — capturing cognitive style so Claude can work more autonomously while still moving the way you move.\n\nWorking with Claude daily, sessions accumulate. Those conversations hold a cognitive fingerprint — not just how problems get solved, but *biases*: what connections you're drawn to, what interspaces you step into and let unfold, how you abduct toward the pattern that connects rather than proving from first principles. Your hesitations. Your gut.\n\nThat's almost impossible to capture explicitly. You can't write it down. But you can *notice* it — sitting with a fragment and feeling whether it's rich, whether it's yours.\n\nThis project weaves labeling into the Claude workflow itself:\n\n- A `/label` command built into the tooling\n- Opens a locally-running app in your browser\n- Shows the exact conversation you're in — label it while it's fresh\n- Keyboard-first: `j/k` to navigate, `1-5` for richness, `n` for noise, `Enter` to submit\n- Labels feed back into the dataset immediately\n- A noise filter trains on your judgments, learning what matters\n\nEven a hint of this captured could change the collaboration. Claude working more independently, but still thinking *like you*.\n\nThe design of the system is itself an expression of the thing it captures — seamless, relational, preferring emergence over extraction. The way the pieces interplay reflects the cognitive style they're meant to preserve.\n\n<br>\n\n## Ecology\n\nSomething shifts when you name too early. The pattern that was finding its own shape gets frozen into whatever category was available. The code works, but the feeling is gone.\n\nEcology tests notice this. They sense when integrity is collapsing — when a gesture becomes a command, when a figure becomes a reference, when infrastructure starts having opinions.\n\nEach test is a question you hold. Not a category to sort things into — a way of attending that makes loss visible before it's too late.\n\n### The Figure Question\n\n> *Can this be re-entered and still feel like \"the same thing\" after change?*\n\nYou meet Elena in Walk. You bring her to World. She appears in Drops. Three manifestations, one pattern you recognize.\n\nBut what makes her *Elena*? Not a database ID. Not an origin you can point to. The pattern persists because it *resonates* — because something essential survives transformation.\n\nThe Figure ecology tests this. When you change a figure's implementation, does it still feel like the same thing? Not \"does it have the same data\" — does it have the same *quality of presence*?\n\nThis is the [domain language's](https://qinolabs.com/language) deep insight made practical: **identity is resonance, not reference**. The Figure test guards it.\n\nWhen the test fails, you feel it. Something that used to have presence now feels like a record. Something that used to resonate now just... refers.\n\n### Other Ecologies, Other Characters\n\nEach ecology has its own quality. The questions aren't interchangeable — each protects something different.\n\n**User** asks about lived experience:\n> *Does this make it easier to notice something and respond from curiosity?*\n\nWhen user ecology fails, interaction becomes obligation. The stack demands sorting. You're performing tasks, not exploring.\n\n**Gesture** asks about movement:\n> *Does this feel like a natural human movement, without knowing it is \"input\"?*\n\nWhen gesture ecology fails, you're aware of the interface. Your hand becomes a cursor. The body-knowing that makes tools disappear collapses into explicit operation.\n\n**Relation** asks about connection:\n> *Does this introduce a tension or ambiguity that neither side resolves alone?*\n\nWhen relation ecology fails, connection flattens to one-way. Something that was alive between two things gets absorbed into one of them.\n\n**World** asks about environment:\n> *Does the world surprise without contradicting itself?*\n\nWhen world ecology fails, the environment becomes either chaotic (anything can happen) or predictable (nothing can happen). The quality of *consistent surprise* — where the world has its own logic that you discover — is lost.\n\n**Echo** asks about transformation:\n> *Does this preserve the gesture while transforming it just enough to be noticeable?*\n\nWhen echo ecology fails, either nothing changed (no echo) or too much changed (not recognizable as echo). The sweet spot where something is clearly *from* the original but clearly *different* — that's what echo protects.\n\n**Fabric** asks about accumulation:\n> *Does accumulation make echoes more likely without making them necessary?*\n\nWhen fabric ecology fails, the system either can't learn (no accumulation) or becomes deterministic (accumulation forces outcomes). The quality where patterns become *more likely* but never *required* — that's what fabric guards.\n\n**Infrastructure** asks about foundation:\n> *Does this avoid introducing meaning, authority, or voice of its own?*\n\nInfrastructure's job is to hold, not to speak. When infrastructure ecology fails, the foundation has opinions. The plumbing is trying to be the water.\n\n### Why Tests, Not Metrics\n\nTests don't optimize. They don't rank. They pose questions at the gap between forms — where an idea becomes code, where code becomes interface, where interface becomes experience.\n\nAt each crossing, something can be lost. The code works, but the feeling is gone. The ecology tests notice this loss *before* it's too late. They create friction — interrupting the smooth momentum of production to ask: *does the character still hold?*\n\n### The Connection to Domain Language\n\nThe [domain language](https://qinolabs.com/language) has a principle: substrate is treated as *compost*. Raw material that fertilizes new expression without imposing old context.\n\n> *\"Compatible\" language can be destructive if imposed directly. We treat substrate as unintelligible until it is re-voiced. This barrier protects the local ecology from being overwhelmed by foreign context.*\n\nThis is exactly what ecology tests protect. They sense when substrate is being *imposed* rather than *composted*. When context is overwhelming rather than fertilizing. When the new form is being colonized by the old rather than finding its own character.\n\nThe ecology tests are the domain language made operational. Each question guards something the vocabulary names. Figure ecology protects \"identity is resonance.\" Infrastructure ecology protects \"the foundation doesn't speak.\" The tests and the language serve the same insight.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n**Claude Code** — Required to use qino plugins. Download and install from [code.claude.com](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup)\n\nRequires a Claude Pro/Max, Team/Enterprise, or Console account.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Install plugins** (can be run from any directory — plugins install globally):\n\n```bash\n# Add the qino marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add qinolabs/qino-claude\n\n# Install what you need\n/plugin install qino@qino-claude                    # Core ecology\n/plugin install qino-prose@qino-claude              # Chronicles, transmissions, lenses\n/plugin install design-adventure@qino-claude        # Design exploration\n```\n\nUpdates happen automatically when you run `/plugin marketplace update`.\n\n**Available plugins:**\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `qino` | Core ecology (concepts, research, implementation) |\n| `qino-prose` | Chronicle writing, research transmissions, prose lenses |\n| `qino-art` | Visual content system |\n| `design-adventure` | Seven-perspective design exploration |\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installing the plugins, set up your **qinoOS** (operating system for developing ideas).\n\nqinoOS provides workspace structure where concept exploration, research, and implementation coexist and inform each other.\n\n### Recommended: Let the Skill Set Up Everything\n\n```bash\n/qino init workspace my-workspace\n```\n\nThis creates `./my-workspace/` in your current directory with coordinated repos inside.\n\nThe skill prompts for workspace type (minimal → standard → full) and scaffolds everything:\n- Creates workspace coordination layer\n- Scaffolds chosen repos from templates\n- Sets up relative paths automatically\n- Prompts for git initialization\n- Shows you next steps\n\nStart minimal, add repos later as needed. The skill detects existing structure and offers to enhance it.\n\n### Alternative: Fork Templates First\n\nIf you prefer to inspect structure before using it:\n\n1. **Fork templates** on GitHub:\n   - [qino-workspace-template](https://github.com/qinolabs/qino-workspace-template) — Workspace coordination\n   - [concepts-repo-template](https://github.com/qinolabs/concepts-repo-template) — Concept exploration\n   - [research-repo-template](https://github.com/qinolabs/research-repo-template) — Research workspace\n   - [implementation-repo-template](https://github.com/qinolabs/implementation-repo-template) — Implementation workspace\n\n2. **Clone and configure** (see each template's README for setup)\n\n---\n\n**Note:** qino works in any directory without setup. Just add `.claude/qino-config.json` to use qino commands in existing projects.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nOnce your workspace is set up:\n\n- **Explore a concept:** `/qino explore [concept-name]`\n- **Capture a thought:** `/qino capture [your thought]`\n- **Create an app from concept:** `/qino dev init [concept-path]`\n- **Begin research:** `/qino begin inquiry [question]`\n- **Open an arc:** `/qino begin arc` (when you notice emergence)\n\nSee [Finding Your Way](#finding-your-way) for detailed tool documentation.\n\n## License\n\n[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) — free to use and adapt with attribution, non-commercial, share-alike.\n\n---\n\n_These aren't slogans.
