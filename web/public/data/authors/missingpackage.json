        "README.md": "# GitGud\n\nKeep your coding skills sharp while using AI. A Claude Code plugin that periodically assigns manual coding challenges with gamification features.\n\n## Why GitGud?\n\nAI assistants like Claude Code make us incredibly productive, but there's a risk: if we never write code ourselves, our skills atrophy. GitGud ensures you practice regularly while still benefiting from AI assistance.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Periodic Challenges**: Every N requests, you'll get a coding task related to your current work\n- **Smart Categorization**: Tasks match your context (API, auth, testing, database, etc.)\n- **Gamification**:\n  - **Streaks**: Track consecutive days of completed tasks\n  - **Achievements**: Unlock badges as you progress\n  - **Skip System**: Skip tasks when you're in a hurry (limited per day)\n- **Persistent Progress**: Your data is stored in `~/.gitgud/` and persists across plugin updates\n- **Fully Configurable**: Adjust frequency, difficulty, and daily skips\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n#### From Marketplace (recommended)\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add MissingPackage/gitgud\n/plugin install gitgud\n```\n\n#### From local folder (for development)\n\n```bash\nclaude --debug --plugin-dir /path/to/gitgud\n```\n\n### Cursor IDE\n\nGitGud now supports Cursor IDE! The same repository works for both Claude Code and Cursor, with shared data between them.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Node.js 14+ installed\n- Cursor IDE 1.7+ (with hook support)\n- Git (for cloning the repository)\n\n#### macOS/Linux\n\n```bash\n# Clone and run installer\ngit clone https://github.com/MissingPackage/gitgud.git ~/.gitgud-cursor\ncd ~/.gitgud-cursor\n./install-cursor.sh\n```\n\n#### Notes for multi-shell setups (bash + zsh, etc.)\n\nThe installer adds command aliases (e.g. `gg-stats`) to your **primary/login shell** config file:\n- zsh → `~/.zshrc`\n- bash → `~/.bashrc`\n- fish → `~/.config/fish/config.fish`\n- other → `~/.profile`\n\nIf you want to override the target file explicitly:\n\n```bash\nGITGUD_SHELL_RC=\"$HOME/.zshrc\" ./install-cursor.sh\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\n# Run in PowerShell\ngit clone https://github.com/MissingPackage/gitgud.git $env:USERPROFILE\\.gitgud-cursor\ncd $env:USERPROFILE\\.gitgud-cursor\n.\\install-cursor.ps1\n```\n\n#### How Cursor Support Works\n\nUnlike Claude Code which can inject context directly, Cursor's `beforeSubmitPrompt` hook only supports `{ continue: boolean }`. Therefore, GitGud for Cursor uses a different approach:\n\n1. **Hook**: Processes prompts and writes task state to files\n2. **Cursor Rule**: Reads task state and instructs the AI to enforce training mode\n3. **Shared Data**: Both Claude Code and Cursor use `~/.gitgud/` for data storage\n\nThis means your streak, achievements, and settings are synchronized between both IDEs!\n\n#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Cursor Rules Configuration\n\n**Cursor does NOT support global rules that apply automatically across all projects.** You must manually configure GitGud rules for each project where you want to use it.\n\n> 📖 **Official documentation**: [Cursor Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)\n\n##### Step 1: Copy the Rule File\n\nFor each project where you want GitGud active:\n\n```bash\n# From your project root:\nmkdir -p .cursor/rules\ncp ~/.gitgud-cursor/cursor/rules/gitgud.mdc .cursor/rules/\n```\n\nOr append to an existing `.cursorrules` file:\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.gitgud-cursor/cursor/rules/gitgud.cursorrules >> .cursorrules\n```\n\n##### Step 2: Enable the Rule in Cursor Settings\n\n**⚠️ Copying the file is not enough!** You must also enable the rule in Cursor:\n\nThe GitGud rule should always be active, but sometimes you may need to enable it once, the first time you want to activate GitGud in a project.\n\n1. Open the project in Cursor\n2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)\n3. Run **\"Reload Window\"** to detect new rules\n4. Go to **Cursor Settings** → **Rules** (or open the **Context** panel → **Rules**)\n5. Verify that the GitGud rule appears and is **enabled** (toggle ON)\n\nWithout enabling the rule, Cursor's AI will not enforce training mode even if tasks are assigned!\n\n##### Verifying the Setup\n\nTo check if GitGud is working in Cursor:\n\n1. Open a project with the rule configured and enabled\n2. Run `node ~/.gitgud-cursor/cursor/validate-cursor.js` to verify setup\n3. Check if pending tasks appear when you interact with Cursor AI\n\n#### Uninstalling from Cursor\n\n```bash\n# macOS/Linux\n~/.gitgud-cursor/uninstall-cursor.sh\n\n# Windows (PowerShell)\n~\\.gitgud-cursor\\uninstall-cursor.ps1\n```\n\nThe uninstaller will ask if you want to keep your data for future reinstallation.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/gg-complete` | Mark current task as completed |\n| `/gg-stats` | View statistics, achievements, and streak |\n| `/gg-reset [counter\\|stats\\|all]` | Reset data |\n| `/gg-config` | View current configuration |\n| `/gg-config <setting> <value>` | Change a setting |\n\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Every N requests (default: 10), you'll receive a coding challenge\n2. The task is **related but not identical** to your request\n3. Claude guides you but won't write the code for you\n4. Complete the task and run `/gg-complete` to update your stats\n5. Or type \"skip\" to use a skip (limited per day)\n\n## Task Categories\n\nTasks are automatically matched to your work context:\n\n| Category | Triggered by |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Security | auth, login, password, jwt, token, oauth |\n| API | endpoint, route, request, response, http, graphql |\n| Database | query, sql, model, schema, migration, orm |\n| Debug | bug, fix, error, problem, crash, issue |\n| Test | test, spec, assert, pytest, jest, mock |\n| Architecture | refactor, pattern, structure, interface |\n| Frontend | component, react, vue, css, form, modal |\n| Function | implement, create, add, write, build |\n\n## Configuration\n\n```bash\n/gg-config                      # View current configuration\n/gg-config frequency 15         # Set task frequency to every 15 requests\n/gg-config daily_skips 5        # Allow 5 skips per day\n/gg-config difficulty hard      # Set difficulty to hard\n/gg-config enabled false        # Disable the plugin\n```\n\n### Settings\n\n| Setting | Description | Options | Default |\n|---------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| `frequency` | Requests between tasks | Any number | 10 |\n| `daily_skips` | Max skips per day | Any number | 3 |\n| `difficulty` | Task complexity | easy, medium, hard, adaptive | adaptive |\n| `enabled` | Plugin active | true, false | true |\n\n## Data Storage\n\nYour progress is stored in `~/.gitgud/` (cross-platform):\n- **Windows**: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.gitgud\\`\n- **macOS**: `/Users/<username>/.gitgud/`\n- **Linux**: `/home/<username>/.gitgud/`\n\nThis ensures your achievements and streaks persist even when updating the plugin.\n\n## Achievements\n\n### Task Milestones\n- 🎯 **First Steps** - Complete your first task\n- ✋ **Getting Hands Dirty** - Complete 5 tasks\n- 📚 **Apprentice** - Complete 10 tasks\n- 🔨 **Craftsman** - Complete 25 tasks\n- 🎓 **Master** - Complete 50 tasks\n- 🏆 **Legend** - Complete 100 tasks\n\n### Streak Achievements\n- 🔥 **Three in a Row** - 3 day streak\n- 📅 **Perfect Week** - 7 day streak\n- 💪 **Two Weeks Strong** - 14 day streak\n- 🥇 **Golden Month** - 30 day streak\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n1. **Don't skip too often** - The challenges are designed to keep your skills sharp\n2. **Take your time** - Quality practice beats rushing through tasks\n3. **Use hints wisely** - Ask Claude for conceptual help, but write the code yourself\n4. **Build a streak** - Consistency is key to maintaining skills\n\n## Current Limitations\n\nThis is v1.0, built in a couple hours on a Friday night. It works, but has room for improvement. Most of these limitations can be overcome with a much higher token usage but this would make no-sense for this kind of plugins:\n\n- **Keyword matching is basic** - Categories are detected via simple regex patterns, not semantic understanding\n- **Tasks are generic** - They don't deeply analyze your specific code context, but are rather based on the conversation context.\n- **No difficulty progression** - Tasks don't automatically become more difficult but if you select the *adaptive* difficulty, Claude will assign them based on what it thinks is your skill level\n- **Limited task variety** - 3 tasks per category, could use more\n- **English only** - Tasks and achievements are only in English\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis plugin was built to scratch my own itch - I wanted to keep my skills sharp while using AI. If you have ideas for improvements, I'd love your help!\n\n**Areas that need love:**\n- Better task categorization (maybe using embeddings?)\n- More diverse and specific tasks\n- Difficulty progression system\n- Localization support\n- More achievements and gamification features\n- Better integration with specific frameworks/agents\n\nFeel free to open issues, submit PRs, or fork and make your own version!\n\n## Author\n\nBuilt with ❤️ (and some AI assistance) by [MissingPackage](https://github.com/MissingPackage)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
