        "README.md": "# bworkspace\n\nClaude Code multi-project workspace launcher with custom prompts and isolated worktrees.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/btimothy-har/bworkspace.git\nuv tool install -e bworkspace/\nws start <project>\n```\n\n## Why bworkspace?\n\nWhen working with Claude Code across multiple projects, you face friction:\n\n- **Scattered context** — Each project needs different prompts, working styles, and domain knowledge\n- **Branch conflicts** — Parallel conversations on the same repo compete for the working directory\n- **Repetitive setup** — Re-configuring directories and prompts for each session\n\nbworkspace solves this with a single command that:\n\n1. **Replaces Claude's default system prompt** — Full control over behavior, consistency across sessions, tailored to your workflow (Claude Code still appends its tool definitions)\n2. **Configures project context** — Loads project-specific prompts and working styles automatically\n3. **Supports isolated worktrees** — Use `-l <label>` to work in a labeled worktree for parallel conversations\n4. **Manages multi-repo projects** — Groups related repositories under one project definition\n\n## Features\n\n### Multi-Project Management\n\nDefine projects in `projects.json` with their directories, descriptions, and working styles. Launch any project with `ws start <project>`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"my-project\": {\n    \"dirs\": [\"GitHub/my-project\", \"GitHub/my-project-docs\"],\n    \"description\": \"My awesome project\",\n    \"working_style\": \"engineering\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Prompts\n\nLayer prompts for different contexts:\n\n| Layer | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Environment** | CLI context, Python/uv usage, workspace paths |\n| **Core** | Working principles, task management, tool usage |\n| **Working Style** | Role definition, communication style, code quality practices |\n| **Project Context** | Domain knowledge, project-specific patterns |\n\n### Git Worktree Isolation\n\nUse `-l <label>` to work in an isolated worktree:\n\n```bash\nws start myproject -l auth      # Create or re-enter \"auth\" worktree\nws start myproject -l bugfix    # Create or re-enter \"bugfix\" worktree\n```\n\nWorktrees live in `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<label>/` with branches named `wt/<label>`.\n\n## Installation\n\nRequires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/btimothy-har/bworkspace.git\ncd bworkspace\n\n# Install as editable (recommended)\nuv tool install -e .\n\n# Or install without editable mode\nuv tool install .\n```\n\nIf uv's tool bin isn't in your PATH:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\n### Upgrading\n\n```bash\nuv tool upgrade bworkspace\n```\n\n### Uninstalling\n\n```bash\nuv tool uninstall bworkspace\n```\n\n### Without Installation\n\n```bash\nuv run ws start <project>\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Launching Projects\n\n```bash\nws start <project>                # Start in project directory\nws start <project> --resume       # Resume previous conversation (-r)\nws start <project> -l <label>     # Work in labeled worktree (creates if new)\n```\n\n### Opening in VS Code\n\n```bash\nws open <project>                  # Open bworkspace + project directories\nws open <project> -n               # Open in new window\nws open <project> -l <label>       # Open in existing worktree\n```\n\n### Managing Worktrees\n\n```bash\nws worktree list <project>         # List worktrees for project\nws worktree list --all             # List all worktrees (-a)\nws worktree clean <project>        # Interactive cleanup\nws worktree clean <project> <name> # Remove specific worktree\nws worktree clean <project> --all  # Remove all worktrees\nws worktree clean <project> -f     # Force removal (--force)\n```\n\n### Listing Projects\n\n```bash\nws projects                        # Show available projects\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nProjects are defined in `projects.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"web-app\": {\n    \"dirs\": [\"GitHub/web-app\"],\n    \"description\": \"Main web application\",\n    \"working_style\": \"engineering\"\n  },\n  \"data-pipeline\": {\n    \"dirs\": [\"GitHub/pipeline\", \"GitHub/pipeline-config\"],\n    \"description\": \"ETL pipeline and configuration\",\n    \"working_style\": \"engineering\",\n    \"context\": \"pipeline\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n| Field | Required | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `dirs` | Yes | Paths relative to `$HOME`. First is primary (cwd), rest are `--add-dir` |\n| `description` | No | Shown in `ws projects` list |\n| `working_style` | No | Loads `prompts/working_styles/{name}.md` |\n| `context` | No | Loads `prompts/context/{name}.md` for project context |\n\n## Prompt System\n\nbworkspace replaces Claude Code's default system prompt via the `--system-prompt` flag. This gives you:\n\n- **Full control** — Define how Claude approaches work, not Anthropic's defaults\n- **Consistency** — Same behavior across sessions; immune to upstream prompt changes\n- **Customization** — Prompts designed for your specific workflow\n\nClaude Code still appends its own tool definitions section (tool schemas, permissions, MCP servers) which cannot be modified. bworkspace controls everything else.\n\n### Prompt Assembly\n\nThe system prompt is assembled from layered sources:\n\n```\nRuntime context (paths, platform, date)\n         ↓\nenvironment.md (CLI usage, Python/uv)\n         ↓\nworking_styles/{name}.md (if configured)\n         ↓\nsystem.md (working principles, tools, agents)\n```\n\nOverride `system.md` with `system.local.md` for personal customization (gitignored).\n\nProject context is injected separately via a SessionStart hook, not included in the system prompt. This places the project context alongside any `CLAUDE.md` file in the primary repository.\n\n### Working Styles\n\n| Style | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `engineering` | Partner role, quest-based work, code quality focus, frequent check-ins |\n| `advisor` | Advisor role, efficient discovery, direct communication, decision support |\n\nCreate local working styles in `prompts/working_styles/*.local.md` (gitignored).\n\n### Project Context\n\nFor multi-repo projects, add cross-repo context in `prompts/context/`. The `context` field in project config points to this file.\n\nSingle-repo projects typically use `CLAUDE.md` in the repo itself.\n\n## Plugins\n\nbworkspace includes optional plugins for extended functionality. These are complementary, not required.\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `ws-collab` | Collaborative discovery and planning for ideation and requirements |\n| `ws-eng` | Code review, PR workflows, testing patterns, Python/SQL development |\n| `ws-cursor` | Discovers `.cursor/*.mdc` context files |\n| `ws-gpg-check` | Verifies GPG card before git commit/tag |\n\n### Installing Plugins\n\nFrom within a Claude Code session started via bworkspace:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/bworkspace\n/plugin install ws-eng@workspace\n```\n\nThe first command registers bworkspace as a marketplace (it discovers `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). The second installs a plugin from it. Available plugins: `ws-collab`, `ws-cursor`, `ws-eng`, `ws-gpg-check`.\n\nCreate custom plugins in `plugins/` following [Claude Code plugin docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins). Plugins in `plugins/private/` are gitignored.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n"
