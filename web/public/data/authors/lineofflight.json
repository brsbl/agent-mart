Browser sessions persist across conversations per project. The skill delegates browsing to subagents that absorb all the navigation and snapshotting, acting as a token firewall for context hygiene.\n",

Like sleep consolidates memory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Encode\n\n`PreCompact` and `SessionEnd` (on clear) hooks fire before context compaction or clearing to record patterns worth remembering:\n\n```markdown\n# .claude/rem/patterns/rails.md\n\n### 2026-02-02: ActiveRecord includes with polymorphic associations\n\n- **Observation**: N+1 queries persist despite using includes\n- **Details**: Use `includes(:commentable)` with explicit polymorphic type\n- **Context**: Polymorphic belongs_to with eager loading\n\n### 2026-02-02: Service objects return Result types\n\n- **Observation**: This codebase wraps service responses in Result objects\n- **Details**: Always return `Result.success(data)` or `Result.failure(error)`\n- **Context**: All service classes in app/services/\n```\n\n### Consolidate\n\nA `Stop` hook fires randomly (~5% of responses) to:\n\n1. Scan patterns for recurring learnings (3+ occurrences)\n2. Crystallize into project skills (`.claude/skills/{domain}/`)\n3. Prune stale/crystallized patterns\n\nEncoding turns conversation into patterns (working memory). REM consolidates them into skills (long-term memory).\n",
