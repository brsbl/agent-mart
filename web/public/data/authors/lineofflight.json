        "plugins/playwright/README.md": "# Playwright\n\nBrowser automation using Playwright.\n\nPlugin provides a headless Playwright MCP server and a skill that guides the agent on use. Browser sessions persist across conversations per project. The skill delegates browsing to subagents that absorb all the navigation and snapshotting, acting as a token firewall for context hygiene.\n",
        "plugins/rem-sleep/README.md": "# REM\n\n> Forgetting is hard.\n\n![The Persistence of Memory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/The_Persistence_of_Memory.jpg)\n\nPattern-to-skill consolidation for Claude Code. Like sleep consolidates memory.\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\nSession transcript (gold mine)\n        │ encode (PreCompact, SessionEnd, ~10% Stop)\n        ▼\n~/.claude/rem/patterns/<project>/{domain}.md    (personal, ephemeral)\n        │ consolidate (~5% Stop)\n        ▼\n.claude/skills/{domain}/                        (shared, durable)\n~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md   (auto memory sync)\n```\n\nUser-scoped input, project-scoped output.\n\n## Encode\n\n`PreCompact`, `SessionEnd` (on clear), and `Stop` (~10% chance) hooks extract patterns from conversation transcripts across 9 categories:\n\n- Debugging insights\n- Tool failures and resolutions\n- Framework/library workarounds\n- Undocumented gotchas\n- Codebase conventions\n- User preferences\n- Brand voice/messaging\n- Effective approaches\n- Architectural decisions\n\nPatterns use YAML frontmatter for machine-parseable metadata:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndomain: rails\ndate: 2026-02-02\ntags: [activerecord, n+1, polymorphic]\n---\n### ActiveRecord includes with polymorphic associations\n- **Observation**: N+1 queries persist despite using includes\n- **Details**: Use `includes(:commentable)` with explicit polymorphic type\n- **Context**: Polymorphic belongs_to with eager loading\n```\n\nThe encode hook also checks existing patterns for contradictions — if a session disproves a previous pattern, the stale entry is updated or removed.\n\n## Consolidate\n\nA `Stop` hook fires randomly (~5% of responses) to:\n\n1. **Pre-filter** — count entries per domain, check for stale entries (>30 days). Skip the model call if nothing needs attention.\n2. **Crystallize** — find recurring learnings (3+ similar observations) and promote to project skills (`.claude/skills/{domain}/`) or `CLAUDE.md`.\n3. **Prune** — remove stale and consolidated patterns.\n4. **Sync** — write one-liner summaries of new skills to auto memory (`MEMORY.md`) and remove duplicate entries.\n\n### Placement Guidance\n\n- **CLAUDE.md** — Universal rules needed on every task: style conventions, return type patterns, error handling policy. Burns context tokens every turn — only universal rules justify the cost.\n- **Skills** — Domain knowledge for specific areas: framework workarounds, library gotchas, API patterns. Loaded on demand.\n\n### Source Citations\n\nSkills include provenance comments tracing back to the observations that produced them:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- consolidated from: rails.md 2026-02-02, 2026-02-04, 2026-02-05 -->\n```\n\n## Read-Before-Act\n\nThe encode hook maintains an index at `~/.claude/rem/patterns/<project>/INDEX.md` with recent pattern titles. To surface this at session start, add to your project `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```markdown\nWhen starting unfamiliar work, check ~/.claude/rem/patterns/ for recent learnings.\n```\n\n## Storage\n\nPatterns are personal working memory — they reflect what *you* encountered. Two developers hitting different bugs build different pattern sets.\n\n| What | Where | Scope |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Patterns | `~/.claude/rem/patterns/<project>/` | User (personal, ephemeral) |\n| Skills | `.claude/skills/{domain}/` | Project (shared, durable) |\n| Auto memory | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md` | User (synced) |\n",
