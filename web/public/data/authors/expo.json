        "README.md": "# Expo Skills\n\nOfficial AI agent skills from the Expo team for building, deploying, and debugging robust Expo apps.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe primarily use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) at Expo, skills are fine-tuned for Opus models. But you can use these skills with any AI agent.\n\n## Claude Code\n\nAdd the marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add expo/skills\n```\n\nInstall a plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install expo-app-design\n/plugin install upgrading-expo\n/plugin install expo-deployment\n```\n\n## Cursor\n\n**Install from GitHub**\n\n1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+Shift+J / Ctrl+Shift+J)\n2. Navigate to `Rules & Command` → `Project Rules` → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub)\n3. Enter: `https://github.com/expo/skills.git`\n\n**How it works:** Skills are automatically discovered and used by the agent based on context. When you ask questions about Expo development, the agent will automatically use the relevant skills (e.g., `building-ui`, `data-fetching`, `deployment`) based on the skill descriptions.\n\n**Note:** Skills won't appear in the `/` slash command menu. The `/` menu in Cursor is for custom commands (stored in `.cursor/commands/`), not for skills. Skills work via auto-discovery - the agent uses them automatically when your questions match their descriptions.\n\n**Verify installation:** After adding the Remote Rule, try asking the agent Expo-related questions like:\n- \"How do I build a UI with Expo Router?\"\n- \"How do I make API calls in my Expo app?\"\n- \"How do I deploy my Expo app to the App Store?\"\n\nIf the skills are working, the agent will use the relevant skill content to answer your questions.\n\n## Any agent\n\n```\nbunx skills add expo/skills\n```\n\n> This will extract the skills individually so you'll need to manually upgrade them.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
