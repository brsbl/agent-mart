Covers anchoring, decoy effect, charm pricing, choice overload, and endowment effect.\n\n**Use when:** Designing pricing pages, optimizing pricing tiers, planning A/B tests for pricing, or when you need the research behind pricing psychology tactics.\n\n## Installation\n\n### For skills.sh / Agent Skills Directory\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add SeedProd/evidence-based-marketing\n```\n\n### For Claude Code Plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin install evidence-based-marketing\n```\n\nOr manually add to your Claude Code plugins directory.\n\n## What Makes These Different\n\nMost marketing skills give you tactics.
