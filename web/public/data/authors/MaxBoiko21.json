        "plugins/code-splitter/README.md": "# Code Splitter Plugin\n\nIntelligently scan and refactor large code files into smaller, maintainable action-pattern based components following language and framework conventions.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Codebase Scanning**: Automatically identify files that need refactoring based on size, complexity, and pattern conventions\n- **File Splitting**: Refactor specific files into smaller, focused action/component files\n- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with Laravel, Symfony, React, Vue, and Node.js projects\n- **Action Pattern Enforcement**: Generates code following action pattern conventions (app/Actions for Laravel, custom patterns for other frameworks)\n- **Smart Detection**: Auto-detects project type from dependencies (composer.json, package.json)\n- **Project Configuration**: Customize thresholds and conventions per project using `.claude/code-splitter.local.md`\n- **Factory/Seeder Support**: Automatically generates Laravel factories and seeders when refactoring models\n- **Import Management**: Updates imports and references automatically after refactoring\n- **Validation**: Validates generated code and suggests improvements\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Plugin will be available at ~/.claude-plugins/code-splitter/\n# Enable it in Claude Code settings or use: cc --plugin-dir ~/.claude-plugins/code-splitter/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Scan Entire Codebase\n\n```\n/scan-code\n```\n\nAnalyzes your entire codebase and identifies files that need refactoring:\n- Files exceeding size thresholds (default: >300 lines)\n- Files with too many methods/functions (default: >10)\n- Files violating action pattern conventions\n- Shows interactive list of candidates with metrics\n- You can select which files to refactor\n\n### Split a Specific File\n\n```\n/split-code <file-path>\n```\n\nRefactors a specific file into smaller, focused components:\n- Analyzes the file and proposes a refactoring plan\n- Shows which methods/sections will be extracted\n- You can manually select which extractions to perform\n- Creates new action/component files following conventions\n- Updates imports and references automatically\n- Validates syntax and suggests improvements\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nCreate `.claude/code-splitter.local.md` in your project root to customize behavior:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# Laravel Settings\nlaravel_actions_path: app/Actions\nlaravel_generate_factories: true\nlaravel_generate_seeders: true\n\n# React/Vue Settings\nreact_components_path: src/components\nvue_components_path: src/components\n\n# Node.js Settings\nnode_services_path: src/services\nnode_utils_path: src/utils\n\n# Refactoring Thresholds\nline_threshold: 300\nmethod_threshold: 10\ncyclomatic_complexity_threshold: 10\n\n# Language-Specific Overrides\nphp_action_namespace: \"App\\\\Actions\"\njs_module_extension: \".ts\"\n---\n\n# Add any additional notes or conventions\n```\n\nAll fields are optional. Plugin uses sensible defaults and auto-detects project type.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Scanning**: Analyzes codebase structure, file sizes, complexity metrics, and pattern violations\n2. **Detection**: Identifies refactoring candidates based on configurable thresholds\n3. **Planning**: Creates a detailed refactoring plan showing which code will be extracted\n4. **Approval**: Shows plan to user for manual selection and approval\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Creates new action/component files\n   - Updates all imports and references\n   - Validates generated code\n   - Suggests quality improvements\n\n## Supported Patterns\n\n### Laravel\n- Controllers → Action classes in `app/Actions/`\n- Models → Traits and related actions\n- Services → Modular service classes\n- Factories and Seeders auto-generation\n\n### React / Vue\n- Large components → Smaller focused components\n- Complex logic → Custom hooks / composables\n- Props management → Component composition\n\n### Node.js\n- Large service files → Focused service modules\n- Complex logic → Utility modules\n- Route handlers → Separate handler functions\n\n## Settings & Conventions\n\nThe plugin respects your project's existing conventions:\n- **Laravel**: Follows action pattern from your coding standards\n- **React**: Uses your component folder structure\n- **Node.js**: Respects your service organization\n- **General**: All thresholds and paths are configurable\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use `/scan-code` first to identify candidates across your entire codebase\n- Run `/split-code` on individual files for precise control\n- Configure `.claude/code-splitter.local.md` once per project for consistent refactoring\n- The agent validates all generated code and won't create invalid files\n\n## Skills Included\n\n- **Code Refactoring Patterns**: Learn refactoring principles and best practices\n- **Language-Specific Action Patterns**: Understand framework-specific conventions for your project type\n\n## Feedback\n\nReport issues or suggest improvements at the project repository.\n"
