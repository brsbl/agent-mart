        "README.md": "# RDR - Reflection-Driven Resume\n\n*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [한국어](README.ko.md)*\n\n> A reflection-driven approach to resume writing, inspired by spec-kit\n\n## Overview\n\nRDR (Reflection-Driven Resume) is a project designed to help you write resumes and portfolios through structured reflection and data organization. Instead of starting with a blank page, RDR guides you through collecting, organizing, and reflecting on your experiences to create authentic, tailored resumes.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n- **Starting Challenge**: Writing a resume from scratch feels overwhelming\n- **Stream of Consciousness**: Need a way to capture thoughts naturally and develop them systematically\n- **Continuous Updates**: Want to easily update resumes after new projects\n- **Company-Specific Tailoring**: Difficulty customizing resumes for different companies\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nThis project **never** writes your resume for you. Instead, it:\n- Provides initial ideas and structure\n- Offers advice on missing content\n- Analyzes your writing style to provide guidance\n- Suggests improvements based on your authentic experiences\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n### `MyBase/`\nRaw, unprocessed data repository for all your activities:\n- Team project chats\n- Presentation slides\n- Codebase snapshots\n- Any relevant materials\n\n**Sub-structure:**\n- `MyBase/summary/`: Contains `[activity-name]-summary.md` files\n- Summary files contain factual information only (no fabrication)\n- Lists facts without summarization\n\n### `Corporate_Analysis/`\nCompany research and analysis workspace:\n- `Corporate_Analysis/[company-role]/base/`: Raw company data\n- `[company-role]-summary.md`: Company culture and information analysis\n\n### `Reflections/`\n**Most Important Folder** - Your authentic reflection space:\n- Write diary-style reflections on all your experiences\n- Focus on problems you solved and mistakes you made\n- General experiences are also valuable to include\n- This content is the foundation of truth\n- **Agents must never auto-generate content here**\n- Used as the backbone for building resume content\n\n### `Generated/`\nOutput folder for final documents:\n- `Generated/resume/`: Company-specific resumes (`resume-[company]-[version].md`)\n- `Generated/portfolio/`: Project portfolios (`[project]-portfolio-[version].md`)\n\n## Planned Features\n\n### Sub-Agents\n1. **Resume Expert**: Reviews and advises on resume content\n2. **Reflection Advisor**: Suggests reflection topics based on MyBase data\n3. **Proofreader**: Checks for typos and grammar\n4. **Chat Analyzer**: Analyzes communication data for insights\n\n### Available Commands\n\n#### `/init` - Project Initialization\n**Korean Name**: RDR 초기화 명령어\n**Purpose**: Creates the complete RDR folder structure and sets up git branching for personal data management.\n\n**What it does**:\n- Creates all required folders (`MyBase/`, `Corporate_Analysis/`, `Reflections/`, `Generated/`)\n- Adds `.gitkeep` files to maintain empty directories\n- Creates and switches to `personal` branch for private work\n- Keeps `main` branch clean for project structure only\n\n**Usage**: Simply run `/init` in Claude Code\n\n---\n\n#### `/mybase-summary` - Comprehensive Data Analysis\n**Korean Name**: MyBase 종합 분석 및 요약 자동화\n**Purpose**: Analyzes all MyBase data using parallel sub-agents and creates structured activity summaries.\n\n**What it does**:\n- Scans all files in MyBase folder and categorizes by project/activity\n- Uses multiple specialized agents to analyze each project independently\n- Extracts factual information: dates, roles, achievements, skills, collaborations\n- Validates data consistency and identifies missing information\n- Generates `[activity-name]-summary.md` files in `MyBase/summary/`\n\n**Expected processing time**: 12-21 minutes depending on data volume\n**Usage**: Request \"MyBase 폴더의 모든 내용을 분석하고 활동별 요약 파일을 생성해주세요\"\n\n---\n\n#### `/basecheckandtellmenew` - Update Detection & Reflection Planning\n**Korean Name**: MyBase 업데이트 워크플로우\n**Purpose**: Detects new additions to MyBase, updates summaries, and suggests immediate reflection opportunities.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. **Change Detection**: Analyzes recent git commits to identify new MyBase files\n2. **Summary Updates**: Adds factual information from new files to existing summaries\n3. **Reflection Analysis**: Determines if activities are ready for reflection or need to be postponed\n4. **Question Generation**: Creates specific reflection questions for completed activities\n\n**Usage**: \"위의 MyBase 업데이트 워크플로우를 1단계부터 3단계까지 순서대로 실행해주세요\"\n\n---\n\n#### `/letsreflection` - Chronological Reflection Question Generator\n**Korean Name**: 시간 순서별 회고 질문 생성\n**Purpose**: Generates systematic reflection questions based on chronological activity analysis with progress tracking.\n\n**What it does**:\n- Reads `reflection-tracker.md` to understand current reflection progress\n- Analyzes all summary files in chronological order\n- Generates targeted reflection questions by category:\n  - `[기술성장]` Technical skill development\n  - `[문제해결]` Problem-solving experiences\n  - `[협업소통]` Collaboration and communication\n  - `[가치관변화]` Value and perspective changes\n  - `[미래연결]` Connections to future growth\n- Updates reflection tracker with new questions and progress\n\n**Features**:\n- Avoids duplicate questions through historical tracking\n- Prioritizes older unprocessed activities\n- Creates meaningful, open-ended questions that encourage deep reflection\n- Maintains systematic progress through your reflection journey\n\n---\n\n#### Additional Workflow Commands\nThe system also includes specialized workflow commands for:\n- **Reflection tracking management**: Maintains systematic progress through reflection questions\n- **Data validation**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of extracted information\n- **Progress monitoring**: Tracks completion status of reflection activities\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis project is designed to work specifically with **Claude Code** (claude.ai/code). Other AI assistants or IDEs are not supported.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Initial Setup\n1. **Initialize Project**: Run `/init` command in Claude Code\n   - Creates complete folder structure\n   - Sets up `personal` branch for your private data\n   - Adds necessary `.gitkeep` files\n\n2. **Populate Data**: Add your raw project materials to `MyBase/`\n   - Team project chats and communications\n   - Presentation slides and documents\n   - Code repositories and technical artifacts\n   - Any materials related to your professional activities\n\n### Data Processing Workflow\n3. **Create Activity Summaries**: Use `/mybase-summary` command\n   - Analyzes all MyBase files using AI agents\n   - Generates factual summaries in `MyBase/summary/`\n   - Takes 12-21 minutes depending on data volume\n   - **Usage**: Request \"MyBase 폴더의 모든 내용을 분석하고 활동별 요약 파일을 생성해주세요\"\n\n4. **Regular Updates**: Use `/basecheckandtellmenew` for ongoing maintenance\n   - Detects new files added to MyBase\n   - Updates existing summaries with new information\n   - Suggests when activities are ready for reflection\n\n### Reflection Process\n5. **Generate Reflection Questions**: Use `/letsreflection` command\n   - Creates chronological reflection questions\n   - Categorizes questions by growth areas\n   - Tracks your progress through systematic reflection\n\n6. **Write Authentic Reflections**: Manually write in `Reflections/` folder\n   - Use generated questions as prompts\n   - Focus on problems solved and lessons learned\n   - Include mistakes and growth experiences\n   - **Important**: This content is never auto-generated - it must be your authentic voice\n\n### Resume Development\n7. **Use commands and agents** to develop your resume content based on your reflections\n   - Summaries provide factual foundation\n   - Reflections provide authentic insights and storytelling\n   - Generated questions help ensure comprehensive coverage\n\n## Command Workflow\n\nThe RDR commands are designed to work together in a systematic workflow that supports continuous reflection and resume development:\n\n### Initial Project Setup\n```\n/init → Creates folder structure and personal branch\n```\n\n### First-Time Data Analysis\n```\nAdd data to MyBase/ → /mybase-summary → Review generated summaries\n```\n**Timeline**: Allow 12-21 minutes for comprehensive analysis\n\n### Ongoing Reflection Cycle\n```\nNew activities → /basecheckandtellmenew → Updated summaries + reflection readiness\n                     ↓\n                /letsreflection → Generated reflection questions\n                     ↓\n             Manual reflection writing → Authentic insights in Reflections/\n                     ↓\n              Resume/portfolio development\n```\n\n### Typical Weekly Workflow\n1. **Monday**: Run `/basecheckandtellmenew` to catch up on recent activity data\n2. **Wednesday**: Use `/letsreflection` to generate new questions for completed activities\n3. **Friday**: Spend 30-60 minutes writing authentic reflections using generated questions\n4. **As needed**: Update resumes/portfolios using reflection insights\n\n### Progress Tracking Features\n- **Reflection Tracker**: `reflections/reflection-tracker.md` maintains systematic progress\n- **Question History**: Prevents duplicate questions and tracks completion\n- **Activity Timeline**: Chronological organization ensures comprehensive coverage\n- **Postponed Activities**: Tracks in-progress projects until completion\n\n### Integration Points\n- **MyBase** → **Summary** (factual foundation)\n- **Summary** → **Questions** (targeted reflection prompts)\n- **Questions** → **Reflections** (authentic insights)\n- **Reflections** → **Resumes** (compelling narratives)\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that no experiences are overlooked and that your professional development is thoroughly documented and reflected upon.\n\n## Development Approach\n\nThis project follows an iterative development approach:\n- Commands and sub-agents will be refined through actual usage\n- The focus is on supporting authentic reflection and content development\n- Tools are designed to enhance, not replace, your genuine experiences\n"
