        "por-dev/README.md": "# POR Dev Plugin\n\nA Claude Code plugin that provides structured workflows for feature development, bug fixes, and chores following the **Product on Rails** methodology.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin helps you build features methodically by enforcing a structured approach to planning and implementation. It ensures thorough analysis before coding begins, reducing rework and improving code quality.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- Consistent planning process across all development tasks\n- Clear separation between discovery, design, planning, and implementation\n- Documented specs that serve as future reference\n- Flexible workflows for different task complexities\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace (if not already added)\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lfnovo/por-marketplace\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install por-dev@por-marketplace\n```\n\n## Workflows\n\nThe plugin provides two main workflows depending on task complexity:\n\n### Fast Track (Quick Tasks)\n\nFor smaller, well-understood tasks where extensive planning isn't needed.\n\n```\n/prime → /fast:[bug|chore|feature] → /implement\n```\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/fast:bug <description>` | Plan a surgical bug fix with root cause analysis |\n| `/fast:chore <description>` | Plan a simple maintenance task |\n| `/fast:feature <description>` | Plan a new feature with phased implementation |\n\n**Output:** Creates a single plan file at `specs/<task-name>.md`\n\n### Complete Workflow (Complex Features)\n\nFor larger features requiring thorough analysis and architecture design.\n\n```\n/prime → /discover → /design → /plan → /implement\n```\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/discover <input>` | Create feature specification from requirements |\n| `/design` | Design technical architecture |\n| `/plan` | Generate detailed implementation tasks |\n\n**Output:** Creates structured documentation in `specs/<feature-slug>/`:\n- `spec.md` - Feature requirements and user stories\n- `architecture.md` - Technical design and decisions\n- `contracts.md` - API/data contracts (if applicable)\n- `plan.md` - Step-by-step implementation tasks\n\n## Command Reference\n\n### `/prime`\n\n**Always run first.** Primes the agent with codebase context by reading project structure, README, and available documentation.\n\n```bash\n/prime\n```\n\n### `/discover <input>`\n\nCreates a feature specification from requirements. Input can be:\n- Natural language description\n- Path to a requirements file\n- Project management card (via MCP tools)\n\n```bash\n/discover \"Add user authentication with OAuth support\"\n/discover ./requirements/auth-feature.md\n/discover LINEAR-123\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Creates a feature branch and `specs/<feature-slug>/` folder\n2. Analyzes requirements to extract: actors, actions, data, constraints\n3. Generates `spec.md` with user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria\n4. Identifies clarification questions and presents them for review\n\n### `/design`\n\nTransforms requirements into technical architecture. Requires completed `spec.md`.\n\n```bash\n/design\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Researches unfamiliar libraries/APIs\n2. Analyzes existing codebase patterns\n3. Designs component structure and data flow\n4. Generates `architecture.md` with technical decisions and rationale\n5. Optionally generates `contracts.md` for API/data contracts\n\n### `/plan`\n\nBreaks architecture into actionable implementation tasks. Requires completed `architecture.md`.\n\n```bash\n/plan\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Organizes tasks by phase (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish)\n2. Identifies parallel execution opportunities\n3. Estimates time per phase\n4. Generates `plan.md` with trackable task list\n\n### `/implement [--ff|--phases]`\n\nExecutes the implementation plan.\n\n```bash\n/implement              # Default: phased approach with review stops\n/implement --ff         # Fast-forward: complete build without stops\n/implement --phases     # Explicit phased approach\n```\n\n**Modes:**\n- `--phases` (default): Stops after each phase for user review\n- `--ff`: Builds completely, only stops for questions or blockers\n\n**What it does:**\n1. Reads and executes the plan step-by-step\n2. Updates `plan.md` marking completed tasks\n3. Reports summary and `git diff --stat` when done\n\n### `/fast:bug <description>`\n\nQuick planning for bug fixes.\n\n```bash\n/fast:bug \"Login fails when email contains + character\"\n```\n\n**Creates plan with:**\n- Bug description and steps to reproduce\n- Root cause analysis\n- Surgical fix approach (minimal changes)\n- Validation commands\n\n### `/fast:chore <description>`\n\nQuick planning for maintenance tasks.\n\n```bash\n/fast:chore \"Upgrade dependencies to latest versions\"\n```\n\n**Creates plan with:**\n- Chore description\n- Step-by-step tasks\n- Validation commands\n\n### `/fast:feature <description>`\n\nQuick planning for smaller features.\n\n```bash\n/fast:feature \"Add export to CSV button on reports page\"\n```\n\n**Creates plan with:**\n- Feature description and user story\n- Phased implementation plan\n- Testing strategy\n- Acceptance criteria\n\n## Utility Commands\n\n### `/all-tools`\n\nLists all available Claude Code tools in the current session.\n\n```bash\n/all-tools\n```\n\n### `/generate-all-claude-mds`\n\nGenerates CLAUDE.md documentation files throughout the codebase to help AI assistants understand the project structure.\n\n```bash\n/generate-all-claude-mds\n```\n\n**What it creates:**\n- Contextual maps for AI navigating the codebase\n- Integration guides showing how modules connect\n- Pattern documentation for consistent code generation\n- Gotcha lists preventing common AI mistakes\n\n**Hierarchy approach:**\n- Builds from deepest directories (leaves) up to root\n- Parent files reference children instead of duplicating content\n- Root serves as a navigation hub\n\n## Workflow Decision Guide\n\n| Scenario | Recommended Workflow |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| Simple bug fix | `/prime` → `/fast:bug` → `/implement` |\n| Dependency update | `/prime` → `/fast:chore` → `/implement` |\n| Small UI feature | `/prime` → `/fast:feature` → `/implement` |\n| New API endpoint | `/prime` → `/discover` → `/design` → `/plan` → `/implement` |\n| Complex feature | `/prime` → `/discover` → `/design` → `/plan` → `/implement` |\n| Refactoring | `/prime` → `/fast:chore` or complete workflow |\n| Document codebase for AI | `/generate-all-claude-mds` |\n\n## Project Structure\n\nAfter using the plugin, your project will have:\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── specs/\n│   ├── fix-login-bug.md           # Fast track plans\n│   ├── upgrade-deps.md\n│   └── user-authentication/       # Complete workflow\n│       ├── spec.md\n│       ├── architecture.md\n│       ├── contracts.md\n│       └── plan.md\n└── ...\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always start with `/prime`** - Ensures the agent understands your codebase\n2. **Use complete workflow for uncertainty** - When requirements are unclear or the feature is complex\n3. **Answer clarification questions** - The discover phase identifies ambiguities early\n4. **Review architecture before planning** - Catch design issues before implementation\n5. **Use `--phases` for learning** - See how the agent approaches each phase\n6. **Use `--ff` for confidence** - When you trust the plan and want faster execution\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please ensure any changes maintain the structured workflow philosophy.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
