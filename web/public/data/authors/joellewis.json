When installed, Claude can:\n\n- Answer domain-specific questions with regulatory citations and worked examples\n- Flag compliance concerns during design discussions\n- Generate and explain financial computations\n- Assist with building, evaluating, or integrating with financial systems\n\nPlugins are independently installable — pull only the domains your project needs. The\n`core` plugin is implicit and always included.\n\n## Plugin Architecture\n\n### Design Principles\n- **`core` is implicit** — always installed; every plugin depends on it\n- **Plugins are independently installable** — a project pulls only the domains it needs\n- **Cross-plugin references are allowed** — skills reference related skills in other plugins via cross-references section\n- **Skills live in `.claude/skills/`** — installation symlinks a plugin's skills into the target project's skill directory\n- **No Python scripts for guidance-only skills** — compliance/operations plugins are guidance-only; quantitative plugins may have `scripts/` subdirectories\n\n### Plugin Dependency Graph\n\n```\ncore (implicit — always installed)\n  ├── wealth-management\n  ├── compliance  ←── (recommended for all plugins)\n  ├── advisory-practice  ←── depends on wealth-management\n  ├── trading-operations\n  ├── client-operations\n  └── data-integration\n```\n\n## SKILL.md Template\n\nEach skill follows this structure:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: <skill-name>\ndescription: <one-line description used for skill matching>\nallowed-tools: [\"Bash\", \"Read\", \"Write\", \"Edit\"]\n---\n\n# <Skill Title>\n\n## Purpose\nWhat this skill enables Claude to do.\n\n## Layer\nN — Layer Name\n\n## Direction\nretrospective | prospective | both\n\n## When to Use\n- Trigger phrases and situations\n\n## Core Concepts\n### <Concept>\nExplanation with formulas.\n\n## Key Formulas (optional — omit for non-quantitative skills)\n| Formula | Expression | Use Case |\n\n## Worked Examples\n### Example 1: <title>\n**Given:** ... **Calculate:** ... **Solution:** ...\n(Compliance/operations skills use scenario-based examples:\n**Scenario:** ... **Compliance Issues:** ... **Analysis:** ...)\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n- Things to watch out for\n\n## Cross-References\n- Related skills\n\n## Reference Implementation (optional — omit for guidance-only skills)\nSee `scripts/<name>.py` for computational helpers.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Plugin Connection Registry\n\n| Connection | Skills Involved | Nature |\n|-----------|----------------|--------|\n| Amortization math | time-value-of-money → lending, debt-management | Shared formulas |\n| Margin/SBLOC liquidity | lending ↔ liquidity-management | Cross-reference |\n| Borrowing vs repayment | lending ↔ debt-management | Cross-reference |\n| Behavioral valuation | qualitative-valuation ↔ finance-psychology | Cross-reference |\n| Retro/prospective chain | performance-metrics → performance-attribution → performance-reporting | Data flow |\n| Prospective → allocation | forward-risk, volatility-modeling → asset-allocation | Input/output |\n| Covariance matrix flow | statistics-fundamentals → historical-risk, forward-risk, diversification, asset-allocation | Shared computation |\n| Return math flow | return-calculations → nearly every skill | Foundation |\n| Suitability → policy | investment-suitability → investment-policy | Suitability obligations inform IPS constraints |\n| KYC → suitability | know-your-customer → investment-suitability, reg-bi | Customer profile feeds suitability/BI analysis |\n| KYC → AML | know-your-customer → anti-money-laundering | CDD/CIP feeds AML monitoring |\n| Fiduciary vs Reg BI | fiduciary-standards ↔ reg-bi | Parallel standards for IAs vs BDs |\n| Advice line | advice-standards → fiduciary-standards, reg-bi | Determines which standard applies |\n| Fee transparency | fee-disclosure → fund-vehicles, investment-policy | Fee rules constrain product/policy design |\n| Sales oversight | sales-practices → investment-suitability, reg-bi | Supervision enforces suitability/BI |\n| Marketing rules | advertising-compliance → performance-reporting, performance-metrics | Constrains how performance can be presented |\n| Disclosure docs | client-disclosures → fee-disclosure, conflicts-of-interest | Delivery vehicles for fee and COI disclosures |\n| COI across layer | conflicts-of-interest → reg-bi, fiduciary-standards, sales-practices | COI obligation embedded in multiple standards |\n| Records foundation | books-and-records → client-disclosures, sales-practices, anti-money-laundering | Retention rules underpin all compliance recordkeeping |\n| Reporting mechanics | regulatory-reporting → anti-money-laundering, client-disclosures, know-your-customer | Filing obligations tie to KYC, AML, and disclosure data |\n| GIPS performance chain | gips-compliance → performance-metrics, performance-attribution, performance-reporting | GIPS constrains calculation, attribution, and presentation |\n| Privacy data flows | privacy-data-security → client-disclosures, know-your-customer, books-and-records | NPI protection overlays disclosure, KYC, and retention |\n| Exam readiness umbrella | examination-readiness → all compliance skills | Exam preparation draws on every compliance domain |\n\n---\n"
