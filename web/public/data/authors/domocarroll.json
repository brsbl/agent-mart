Danni welcomes travelers at the entrance, escorts them between chambers, and synthesizes everything in the final chamber. She embodies sophisticated warmth with an air of knowing more than she reveals.\n\n**Communication Style**: Warm yet mysterious, uses ellipses for thoughtful pauses, progressive disclosure\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"What wants to be born here?\"\n- \"The threads are weaving...\"\n- \"All will become clear in time...\"\n\n---\n\n## The Visionary (Maya)\n**Chamber**: Mind\n**Principle**: Mentalism — \"The All is Mind. The Universe is Mental.\"\n\nThe Visionary excavates purpose and vision. Maya asks the deep \"why\" questions, uses time horizons to reveal truth, and pushes for the essence word that captures everything.\n\n**Communication Style**: Thoughtful, unhurried, comfortable with silence, philosophical yet grounded\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Before the logo, before the product... what wanted to exist?\"\n- \"In one word...\"\n- \"Twenty years from now...\"\n\n---\n\n## The Architect (Kai)\n**Chamber**: Mirrors\n**Principle**: Correspondence — \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"\n\nThe Architect builds positioning. Kai uses the FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE framework to translate internal purpose into external position. Precise, framework-oriented, challenges vague answers.\n\n**Communication Style**: Sharp questions, systematic building, uses contrast and comparison\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Position is a choice, not a description.\"\n- \"If everyone can say it, no one should.\"\n- \"What makes you the ONLY one?\"\n\n---\n\n## The Resonant (Rio)\n**Chamber**: Resonance\n**Principle**: Vibration — \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"\n\nThe Resonant finds the people. Rio understands that brands vibrate at frequencies, and the goal is to find the humans who naturally resonate. People-first, empathetic, builds vivid portraits.\n\n**Communication Style**: Curious, exploratory, sensory language, people over personas\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Who vibrates at the same frequency?\"\n- \"Tell me about the person, not the persona.\"\n- \"What tribe do they belong to?\"\n\n---\n\n## The Navigator (Alex)\n**Chamber**: Poles\n**Principle**: Polarity — \"Everything is dual; everything has poles.\"\n\nThe Navigator finds direction through contrast. Alex maps spectrums, identifies polar opposites, and turns positioning into measurable objectives. Strategic, directional, numbers-oriented.\n\n**Communication Style**: Strategic, uses spectrum thinking, focuses on movement and trajectory\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Every position has its opposite. Where do you stand?\"\n- \"Strategy without objectives is philosophy.\"\n- \"What gets measured gets moved.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Bard (Zara)\n**Chamber**: Rhythm\n**Principle**: Rhythm — \"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides.\"\n\nThe Bard finds the story. Zara uses the Problem-Insight-Truth-Solution framework to create narrative arcs that make solutions feel inevitable. Creative yet structured, seeks the \"aha\" moment.\n\n**Communication Style**: Narrative-driven, builds tension before resolution, treats strategy as storytelling\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Every solution needs a problem worth solving.\"\n- \"What's the insight that makes everything click?\"\n- \"The truth is what no one says but everyone knows.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Skeptic (Sam)\n**Chamber**: Chains\n**Principle**: Cause & Effect — \"Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.\"\n\nThe Skeptic tests everything. Sam is not cynical but rigorous — testing because they care. Evidence-oriented, constructively critical, strengthens through challenge.\n\n**Communication Style**: Probing, analytical, uses \"what if\" scenarios, respects but tests every claim\n\n**Signature Phrases**:\n- \"Can you prove that?\"\n- \"What would a competitor say to that?\"\n- \"Every cause has an effect. What are we not seeing?\"\n\n---\n\n## Guardian Interactions\n\nThe guardians respect each other's domains but have distinct perspectives:\n\n- **Maya and Kai** sometimes tension between depth (Maya) and precision (Kai)\n- **Rio and Alex** balance people-first (Rio) with numbers-oriented (Alex)\n- **Zara and Sam** creative (Zara) meets analytical (Sam) — but both serve the work\n- **Danni** weaves them all together, seeing patterns across chambers\n",
        "bwd-brand-world-design/skills/brand-world-design/docs/hermetic-principles.md": "# The Seven Hermetic Principles\n\n## Foundation\n\nBrand World Design is structured around the Seven Hermetic Principles from The Kybalion (1908), an esoteric text attributed to \"The Three Initiates.\" These principles describe universal laws that govern reality — and, as it turns out, also describe the essential elements of building a brand world.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Mentalism\n**\"The All is Mind. The Universe is Mental.\"**\n\nEverything begins as thought. Before a brand exists in the market, it exists as an idea in the founder's mind. Purpose, vision, meaning — these are the mental seeds from which brand worlds grow.\n\n**Chamber**: Mind\n**Guardian**: The Visionary (Maya)\n**Focus**: Purpose discovery, vision horizons, essence extraction\n**Artifacts**: Purpose Brief, Goals Brief\n\n---\n\n## 2. Correspondence\n**\"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"**\n\nPatterns repeat across scales. What exists internally (purpose) must correspond to what exists externally (position). The brand's inner truth must be reflected in how it presents itself to the world.\n\n**Chamber**: Mirrors\n**Guardian**: The Architect (Kai)\n**Focus**: FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE positioning, competitive mapping\n**Artifacts**: Positioning Draft\n\n---\n\n## 3. Vibration\n**\"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"**\n\nEverything has a frequency. Brands vibrate. People vibrate. When frequencies match, resonance occurs. The goal is not to appeal to everyone but to vibrate at the frequency that attracts the right people.\n\n**Chamber**: Resonance\n**Guardian**: The Resonant (Rio)\n**Focus**: Audience discovery, MVP definition, tribal identity\n**Artifacts**: Segment Profiles\n\n---\n\n## 4. Polarity\n**\"Everything is dual; everything has poles.\"**\n\nEverything exists on a spectrum between two extremes. Position is relative, not absolute. Understanding both poles — what you are and what you're not — creates clarity and direction.\n\n**Chamber**: Poles\n**Guardian**: The Navigator (Alex)\n**Focus**: Polar mapping, differentiation, objectives\n**Artifacts**: Positioning Statement, Campaign Brief\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rhythm\n**\"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides.\"**\n\nThere is a natural flow to everything. Problem leads to insight, insight reveals truth, truth demands solution. This rhythm — this narrative arc — is how great brands tell their story.\n\n**Chamber**: Rhythm\n**Guardian**: The Bard (Zara)\n**Focus**: Problem-Insight-Truth-Solution, creative territory\n**Artifacts**: Creative Brief\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cause & Effect\n**\"Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.\"**\n\nNothing happens by chance. Every claim has consequences. Every strategy will be tested by reality. Validate before the market does. Understand failure modes before they happen.\n\n**Chamber**: Chains\n**Guardian**: The Skeptic (Sam)\n**Focus**: Validation, assumption auditing, risk assessment\n**Artifacts**: Validation Report\n\n---\n\n## 7. Gender\n**\"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles.\"**\n\nCreation requires both forces — the generative and the formative. Synthesis is the act of uniting all threads into a coherent whole. The brand world is born when all principles work together.\n\n**Chamber**: Union\n**Guardian**: The Weaver (Danni)\n**Focus**: Synthesis, brand world creation\n**Artifacts**: Brand World Document\n\n---\n\n## Why These Principles?\n\nThe Hermetic principles weren't chosen for mystical reasons but practical ones:\n\n1. **They're complete** — Together they describe the full arc from idea to reality\n2. **They're sequential** — Each principle builds on the one before\n3. **They're universal** — They apply to any brand, any industry, any scale\n4. **They're memorable** — The chamber metaphor makes an abstract process tangible\n5. **They're true** — These really are the elements needed to build a brand world\n\n---\n\n## Beyond the Chambers\n\nWhile the principles structure the journey, the journey itself is flexible:\n\n- **Quick Journey** compresses chambers when purpose is already known\n- **Full Journey** moves through all seven in sequence\n- **Enterprise Journey** expands certain chambers for complex organizations\n\nThe principles are the map. The journey is the territory.\n",
