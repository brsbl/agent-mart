        "README.md": "# Pan Out\n\nYou want to make a proper bolognese — the kind that actually tastes like it came from a kitchen that knows what it's doing. You don't want to memorize technique details or wing it from a blog recipe. You want to understand the science, hear what to do next without looking at a screen, swap ingredients for what's actually in your fridge, and learn from each cook.\n\nPan Out makes that practical. It's a set of AI skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that handle the full cooking pipeline:\n\n1. **Research** -- deep-dive into a dish's science, techniques, and safety, then build a step-by-step protocol\n2. **Cook** -- talk you through each phase at the stove with timers, temperature checks, and ingredient swaps\n3. **Debrief** -- after you eat, capture what worked and what didn't so next time starts better\n\nThe system is built around **protocols** -- structured recipe files that hold everything needed to cook a dish: ingredients, phases, timing, temperatures, sensory cues, and the science behind each step.\n\n## Installation\n\n### As a Plugin (recommended)\n\nIn any Claude Code session:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add alexeyv/pan-out\n/plugin install pan-out@pan-out-marketplace\n```\n\nThen create your personal reference files:\n\n```\ncp references/cook-profile.example.md references/cook-profile.md\ncp references/calibration.example.md references/calibration.md\n```\n\nEdit `references/cook-profile.md` with your equipment, preferences, and kitchen environment. If you have temperature instruments, run a boiling-water calibration and fill in `references/calibration.md`.\n\n### From Source\n\n1. Clone this repo\n2. Run Claude Code with the plugin flag:\n   ```\n   claude --plugin-dir ./pan-out\n   ```\n3. Copy and customize your personal reference files:\n   ```\n   cp references/cook-profile.example.md references/cook-profile.md\n   cp references/calibration.example.md references/calibration.md\n   ```\n4. Edit `references/cook-profile.md` with your equipment, preferences, and kitchen environment\n5. If you have temperature instruments, run a boiling-water calibration and fill in `references/calibration.md`\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) v1.0.33 or later\n- An instant-read probe thermometer — for checking liquid temps, meat doneness, and food safety. Practically a must.\n- An infrared (IR) thermometer — point-and-shoot surface temp readings for searing and high-heat work. Really nice to have.\n- A dictation app like [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.com) — strongly recommended. Typing mid-cook is slow and distracting; dictation lets you wipe your hands, hold a button, say what you need, and let go — much faster than typing.\n\nWorks on macOS, Linux, and Windows, including voice output. Dictation and voice are both optional, but they make the cooking experience much smoother.\n\n### Usage\n\n- Run **`/panout-help`** to get oriented\n- Say **\"recipe [dish]\"** to research a dish and create a protocol\n- Say **\"let's cook [dish]\"** to cook a dish step by step\n- Say **\"debrief\"** after cooking to capture lessons\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\npan-out/\n├── skills/                 # The skills that do the work\n│   ├── cook/               #   Real-time guided cooking\n│   ├── recipe/             #   Research and protocol creation\n│   ├── debrief/            #   Post-cook review and learning\n│   └── help/               #   Orientation and skill routing\n├── protocols/              # YAML cooking protocols\n├── references/             # Shared knowledge base\n│   ├── protocol-format.md  #   Protocol format specification\n│   ├── food-safety.md      #   Safe cooking temperatures\n│   ├── cook-profile.md     #   Your equipment & preferences (personal, gitignored)\n│   └── calibration.md      #   Your thermometer offsets (personal, gitignored)\n├── sessions/               # Cook session state files (gitignored)\n├── memory/                 # Accumulated lessons and notes (gitignored)\n├── bin/                    # Utility scripts\n│   └── progress-timer.sh   #   Background timer with spoken updates\n└── test/                   # Test harnesses\n```\n\n## Protocols\n\nProtocols are structured recipe files that hold the full plan for cooking a dish. See [references/protocol-format.md](references/protocol-format.md) for the format.\n\nExample protocols included:\n- **beef-stew.yaml** -- slow braise with a hard sear up front (~3h)\n- **bolognese.yaml** -- classic ragu, oven-braised (~4.5h)\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Hands-on vs. hands-off\n\n- **When you're at the stove** (prep, searing) -- one instruction at a time, waits for you to say \"done\" before moving on\n- **When you can walk away** (braising, resting) -- a timer runs in the background and calls you back when something needs attention\n\n### Temperature guidance\n\nIf you have thermometers, the system reads your calibration data and tells you exactly what your instrument should show: *\"We want 90C — that's about 86-87C on your probe.\"*\n\n### Recipes that improve\n\nEach cook makes the protocol better. The debrief captures timing adjustments, technique discoveries, and seasoning preferences so next time starts where this time left off.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **Voice is the headline, screen is the article** -- short spoken summaries you can hear over kitchen noise, full detail on screen when you look\n- **Science first** -- understand why, not just how\n- **Sensory cues over clock time** -- \"mahogany brown\" matters more than \"4 minutes\"\n- **Forward-only** -- once you confirm a step, it's done. No going back.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nPan Out's skill structure, workflow patterns, and prompt language were built with and heavily inspired by the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) by BMad Code, LLC ([MIT](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/LICENSE)).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n"
