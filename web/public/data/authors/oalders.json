Install it and authenticate with `gh auth login`.\n\n**Superpowers plugin:** Most skills and commands rely on [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for workflows like brainstorming, verification, and subagent-driven development. Install it first:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd from the Claude Code plugin marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add oalders/kitchen-sink &&\n  claude plugin install kitchen-sink\n```\n\n## Contents\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **/fix-gh-issue** | Point your robot at a GitHub issue and let it start beeping and booping |\n| **/fix-linter-warnings** | Linter busywork in bite-sized chunks—your robot's idea of a good time, not yours |\n| **/git-rebase** | Rebase without the cruel and unusual punishment of solving your own merge conflicts |\n| **/break-into-gh-issues** | Maybe split big issues into smaller ones—so you get a code review and not an intervention |\n| **/address-gh-review** | A robot that does the urgent repairs now and books appointments for the rest |\n| **/request-review** | Get code review feedback without permission prompts stalling the workflow |\n| **/frontend-review** | Frontend expert review catching accessibility gaps, responsive design issues, and CSS anti-patterns |\n| **/playwright-review** | Playwright test review enforcing ARIA labels, detecting UI layout issues, and optimizing performance |\n| **/security-review** | OWASP-based security review catching session fixation, PII logging, and timing attacks |\n| **/codebase-health** | Systematic health check optimizing codebase for AI consumption—dead code, token waste, and discoverability |\n| **/audit-claude-md** | Audit CLAUDE.md files for token efficiency, clarity, and accuracy against actual codebase |\n\n### Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **code-review-flow** | Streamlined code review workflow that avoids permission prompts |\n| **over-engineer-no-more** | Prevents your robot from building a spaceship when you asked for a bicycle |\n\n### Hooks\n\n| Hook | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **suggest-review-after-commit** | Smart PostToolUse hook that analyzes committed files and suggests relevant review commands (`/frontend-review`, `/playwright-review`, `/security-review`, or `/request-review`) based on file types and patterns |\n\n## Commands Overview\n\n### /fix-gh-issue\n\nAutomates the workflow for fixing GitHub issues:\n1. Gets issue number from argument or branch name (`fix-978` -> `978`)\n2. Fetches issue details with `gh` and applies \"in progress\" label\n3. Assesses complexity (trivial vs non-trivial)\n4. Suggests brainstorming for complex issues\n5. Implements fix (direct or via subagent-driven-development)\n6. Runs specialized code review (conditional: skips if subagent-driven-development used)\n   - Frontend changes → `/frontend-review`\n   - Security changes → `/security-review`\n   - Playwright tests → `/playwright-review`\n   - Other changes → `/request-review`\n7. Verifies with `verification-before-completion`\n8. Creates draft PR that closes the issue\n\n### /fix-linter-warnings\n\nBatch approach to linter cleanup:\n- Fix 25 issues per iteration\n- Prioritize quick wins (formatting, constants)\n- Use suppression directives when fixes would degrade code\n- Always include justification comments\n\n### /git-rebase\n\nRebases the current branch onto origin/main:\n- Fetches latest changes and pulls with `--rebase`\n- Reads and resolves merge conflicts\n- Uses `--force-with-lease` for safe pushing (never `--force`)\n\n### /break-into-gh-issues\n\nBreaks down work into manageable GitHub issues:\n- Single issue for <= 400 lines of changes\n- Multi-issue with umbrella tracking for larger work\n- Creates labels if they don't exist\n- Links sub-issues back to umbrella with progress checklist\n\n### /address-gh-review\n\nAddresses PR code review feedback:\n- Fetches comments from the current branch's PR\n- Evaluates each suggestion critically (doesn't blindly implement)\n- Fixes immediate issues with atomic commits\n- Creates GitHub issues for deferred items\n- Runs tests and pushes when done\n\n### /request-review\n\nRequest code review during development (before creating PR):\n- Gets git SHAs from conversation context (no permission prompts)\n- Fetches issue details for fix-* branches\n- Invokes `superpowers:code-reviewer` with structured template\n- Returns categorized feedback (Critical/Important/Minor)\n- Allows unattended execution - can leave window while review runs\n\n### /frontend-review\n\nFrontend-focused code review for HTML/CSS/image changes:\n- Systematic image optimization and accessibility checks\n- ARIA strategy analysis (decorative vs informative)\n- Responsive design verification across viewports (320px, 768px, 1920px)\n- CSS best practices (custom properties, relative units, performance)\n- Visual regression checklist for manual testing\n- SVG optimization and preload hints\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with frontend-specific checklist\n\n### /playwright-review\n\nSpecialized review for Playwright E2E tests:\n- Enforces ARIA label verification in tests (aria-invalid, aria-describedby, aria-live)\n- Identifies UI/layout issues (buttons bumping footer, viewport overflow)\n- Detects 7 performance anti-patterns (waitForFunction, sequential fills, networkidle waits)\n- Suggests specific optimizations with estimated time savings\n- Checks accessibility test coverage (keyboard navigation, focus management)\n- Provides performance improvement summary table\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with Playwright-specific checklist\n\n### /security-review\n\nOWASP-based systematic security review:\n- Authentication & session management (session fixation, regeneration)\n- Authorization & access control (vertical/horizontal privilege escalation)\n- Input validation & injection (SQL, XSS, command injection)\n- Sensitive data exposure (PII logging, cleartext transmission)\n- Security misconfiguration (CSRF, CORS, security headers)\n- Business logic flaws (race conditions, timing attacks)\n- Uses Opus model for comprehensive security analysis\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with OWASP Top 10 checklist\n\n### /codebase-health\n\nSystematic health check optimizing codebase for AI consumption:\n- Dead code analysis (unused imports, orphaned files, commented blocks)\n- File organization (>1000 line files, deep nesting, vendor directory tracking)\n- Discoverability issues (generic naming, missing READMEs, hidden functionality)\n- Code duplication detection (template/function similarity, pattern inconsistency)\n- Dependency health (circular dependencies, unused exports, orphaned modules)\n- Naming convention consistency (mixed case detection across languages)\n- Generates health score (0-100) with category breakdown\n- Estimates token savings potential (e.g., 148K tokens from vendor removal)\n- Prioritized recommendations (Critical/Important/Minor with time estimates)\n- Spawns `general-purpose` subagent with comprehensive 7-category checklist\n\n### /audit-claude-md\n\nComprehensive CLAUDE.md audit for quality and accuracy:\n- Token efficiency (duplication between files, verbose sections, defensive explanations)\n- Clarity issues (contradictory instructions, vague guidance, ambiguous commands)\n- Organization problems (multiple file chaos, hard to scan, scattered information)\n- Accuracy against codebase (outdated commands, dead links, wrong env vars, broken examples)\n- AI-specific anti-patterns (nested conditionals, ambiguous pronouns, negative-only instructions)\n- Workflow verification (compare docs against CI/scripts/Makefiles)\n- Systematic verification (REQUIRED checks for command paths, file references, tool availability)\n- Version-specific instruction checking (detect obsolete version references)\n- Generates quality score (0-100) with category breakdown\n- Estimates token savings (e.g., 17% reduction from deduplication)\n- Prioritized recommendations with before/after examples\n- Spawns `general-purpose` subagent with comprehensive 6-category checklist\n\n## Skills Overview\n\n### code-review-flow\n\nWrapper around `superpowers:requesting-code-review` that eliminates permission prompts during code reviews:\n- Gets git SHAs from conversation context or separate git commands (not compound commands)\n- Invokes `superpowers:code-reviewer` subagent with proper template\n- Allows code reviews to run unattended without blocking on permission prompts\n\n**Benefits:**\n- No interruptions during code review workflow\n- Can leave the window while review runs\n- Uses information already in context when available\n\n### over-engineer-no-more\n\nPrevents over-engineering by evaluating whether a task needs heavyweight processes:\n- Checks indicators: adding constants? < 100 lines? < 3 files?\n- Announces decision with reasoning\n- Routes to direct implementation or subagent workflow\n\n## Hooks Overview\n\n### suggest-review-after-commit\n\nAutomatically suggests the most relevant review command(s) after you commit changes, with **interactive multi-select** to choose one or more reviews to run immediately:\n\n**Frontend Review (`/frontend-review`)**\n- Triggered by: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.html`\n- Directories: `components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`\n- Files: `tailwind.config.*`, `globals.css`\n\n**Playwright Review (`/playwright-review`)**\n- Triggered by: `.spec.ts`, `.spec.js`, `.test.ts`\n- Directories: `e2e/`, `tests/`, `playwright/`\n- Files: `playwright.config.*`, `*.e2e.*`\n\n**Security Review (`/security-review`)**\n- Triggered by: Files with `auth`, `login`, `password`, `token`, `session`, `api/` in path\n- Files: `.env.example`, authentication modules, API endpoints\n\n**Generic Review (`/request-review`)**\n- Always offered as a fallback option\n- Recommended for general-purpose code changes\n\n**Example:**\n```\nI notice you just committed 3 file(s):\n\n🎨 Frontend: Header.tsx, globals.css\n🎭 Playwright: header.spec.ts\n\nWhich review(s) would you like to run?\n□ Frontend Review - Images, accessibility, responsive design, CSS patterns\n□ Playwright Review - Accessibility, UI issues, performance optimization\n□ Generic Review - Comprehensive code review of all changes\n```\n\nSelect multiple reviews with checkboxes, and they'll run sequentially with a combined summary at the end.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Image Credit\n\n\"[Mog & the kitchen sink adventure
