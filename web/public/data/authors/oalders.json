Install it and authenticate with `gh auth login`.\n\n**Superpowers plugin:** Most skills and commands rely on [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for workflows like brainstorming, verification, and subagent-driven development. Install it first:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd from the Claude Code plugin marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add oalders/kitchen-sink &&\n  claude plugin install kitchen-sink\n```\n\n## Contents\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **/fix-gh-issue** | Point your robot at a GitHub issue and let it start beeping and booping |\n| **/fix-linter-warnings** | Linter busywork in bite-sized chunks—your robot's idea of a good time, not yours |\n| **/git-rebase** | Rebase without the cruel and unusual punishment of solving your own merge conflicts |\n| **/break-into-gh-issues** | Maybe split big issues into smaller ones—so you get a code review and not an intervention |\n| **/address-gh-review** | A robot that does the urgent repairs now and books appointments for the rest |\n| **/request-review** | Get code review feedback without permission prompts stalling the workflow |\n| **/frontend-review** | Frontend expert review catching accessibility gaps, responsive design issues, and CSS anti-patterns |\n| **/playwright-review** | Playwright test review enforcing ARIA labels, detecting UI layout issues, and optimizing performance |\n| **/security-review** | OWASP-based security review catching session fixation, PII logging, and timing attacks |\n| **/codebase-health** | Systematic health check optimizing codebase for AI consumption—dead code, token waste, and discoverability |\n| **/audit-claude-md** | Audit CLAUDE.md files for token efficiency, clarity, and accuracy against actual codebase |\n\n### Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **code-review-flow** | Streamlined code review workflow that avoids permission prompts |\n| **over-engineer-no-more** | Prevents your robot from building a spaceship when you asked for a bicycle |\n\n## Commands Overview\n\n### /fix-gh-issue\n\nAutomates the workflow for fixing GitHub issues:\n1. Gets issue number from argument or branch name (`fix-978` -> `978`)\n2. Fetches issue details with `gh` and applies \"in progress\" label\n3. Assesses complexity (trivial vs non-trivial)\n4. Suggests brainstorming for complex issues\n5. Implements fix (direct or via subagent-driven-development)\n6. Runs specialized code review (conditional: skips if subagent-driven-development used)\n   - Frontend changes → `/frontend-review`\n   - Security changes → `/security-review`\n   - Playwright tests → `/playwright-review`\n   - Other changes → `/request-review`\n7. Verifies with `verification-before-completion`\n8. Creates draft PR that closes the issue\n\n### /fix-linter-warnings\n\nBatch approach to linter cleanup:\n- Fix 25 issues per iteration\n- Prioritize quick wins (formatting, constants)\n- Use suppression directives when fixes would degrade code\n- Always include justification comments\n\n### /git-rebase\n\nRebases the current branch onto origin/main:\n- Fetches latest changes and pulls with `--rebase`\n- Reads and resolves merge conflicts\n- Uses `--force-with-lease` for safe pushing (never `--force`)\n\n### /break-into-gh-issues\n\nBreaks down work into manageable GitHub issues:\n- Single issue for <= 400 lines of changes\n- Multi-issue with umbrella tracking for larger work\n- Creates labels if they don't exist\n- Links sub-issues back to umbrella with progress checklist\n\n### /address-gh-review\n\nAddresses PR code review feedback:\n- Fetches comments from the current branch's PR\n- Evaluates each suggestion critically (doesn't blindly implement)\n- Fixes immediate issues with atomic commits\n- Creates GitHub issues for deferred items\n- Runs tests and pushes when done\n\n### /request-review\n\nRequest code review during development (before creating PR):\n- Gets git SHAs from conversation context (no permission prompts)\n- Fetches issue details for fix-* branches\n- Invokes `superpowers:code-reviewer` with structured template\n- Returns categorized feedback (Critical/Important/Minor)\n- Allows unattended execution - can leave window while review runs\n\n### /frontend-review\n\nFrontend-focused code review for HTML/CSS/image changes:\n- Systematic image optimization and accessibility checks\n- ARIA strategy analysis (decorative vs informative)\n- Responsive design verification across viewports (320px, 768px, 1920px)\n- CSS best practices (custom properties, relative units, performance)\n- Visual regression checklist for manual testing\n- SVG optimization and preload hints\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with frontend-specific checklist\n\n### /playwright-review\n\nSpecialized review for Playwright E2E tests:\n- Enforces ARIA label verification in tests (aria-invalid, aria-describedby, aria-live)\n- Identifies UI/layout issues (buttons bumping footer, viewport overflow)\n- Detects 7 performance anti-patterns (waitForFunction, sequential fills, networkidle waits)\n- Suggests specific optimizations with estimated time savings\n- Checks accessibility test coverage (keyboard navigation, focus management)\n- Provides performance improvement summary table\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with Playwright-specific checklist\n\n### /security-review\n\nOWASP-based systematic security review:\n- Authentication & session management (session fixation, regeneration)\n- Authorization & access control (vertical/horizontal privilege escalation)\n- Input validation & injection (SQL, XSS, command injection)\n- Sensitive data exposure (PII logging, cleartext transmission)\n- Security misconfiguration (CSRF, CORS, security headers)\n- Business logic flaws (race conditions, timing attacks)\n- Uses Opus model for comprehensive security analysis\n- Spawns `superpowers:code-reviewer` with OWASP Top 10 checklist\n\n### /codebase-health\n\nSystematic health check optimizing codebase for AI consumption:\n- Dead code analysis (unused imports, orphaned files, commented blocks)\n- File organization (>1000 line files, deep nesting, vendor directory tracking)\n- Discoverability issues (generic naming, missing READMEs, hidden functionality)\n- Code duplication detection (template/function similarity, pattern inconsistency)\n- Dependency health (circular dependencies, unused exports, orphaned modules)\n- Naming convention consistency (mixed case detection across languages)\n- Generates health score (0-100) with category breakdown\n- Estimates token savings potential (e.g., 148K tokens from vendor removal)\n- Prioritized recommendations (Critical/Important/Minor with time estimates)\n- Spawns `general-purpose` subagent with comprehensive 7-category checklist\n\n### /audit-claude-md\n\nComprehensive CLAUDE.md audit for quality and accuracy:\n- Token efficiency (duplication between files, verbose sections, defensive explanations)\n- Clarity issues (contradictory instructions, vague guidance, ambiguous commands)\n- Organization problems (multiple file chaos, hard to scan, scattered information)\n- Accuracy against codebase (outdated commands, dead links, wrong env vars, broken examples)\n- AI-specific anti-patterns (nested conditionals, ambiguous pronouns, negative-only instructions)\n- Workflow verification (compare docs against CI/scripts/Makefiles)\n- Systematic verification (REQUIRED checks for command paths, file references, tool availability)\n- Version-specific instruction checking (detect obsolete version references)\n- Generates quality score (0-100) with category breakdown\n- Estimates token savings (e.g., 17% reduction from deduplication)\n- Prioritized recommendations with before/after examples\n- Spawns `general-purpose` subagent with comprehensive 6-category checklist\n\n## Skills Overview\n\n### code-review-flow\n\nWrapper around `superpowers:requesting-code-review` that eliminates permission prompts during code reviews:\n- Gets git SHAs from conversation context or separate git commands (not compound commands)\n- Invokes `superpowers:code-reviewer` subagent with proper template\n- Allows code reviews to run unattended without blocking on permission prompts\n\n**Benefits:**\n- No interruptions during code review workflow\n- Can leave the window while review runs\n- Uses information already in context when available\n\n### over-engineer-no-more\n\nPrevents over-engineering by evaluating whether a task needs heavyweight processes:\n- Checks indicators: adding constants? < 100 lines? < 3 files?\n- Announces decision with reasoning\n- Routes to direct implementation or subagent workflow\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Image Credit\n\n\"[Mog & the kitchen sink adventure #01](https://www.flickr.com/photos/87285907@N00/3009300486)\" by [ju5ti](https://www.flickr.com/photos/87285907@N00) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=openverse).\n"

        "README.md": "# Talk About Us\n\n> \"They have to be able to talk about us without us.\" - Anil Dash\n\n<img src=\"images/featured.jpeg\" alt=\"Microphone\" width=\"600\">\n\nA skill that helps you audit content for shareability using [Anil Dash's framework](https://www.anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/). Ensure your website copy, SEO descriptions, and marketing content are so clear and compelling that others can share them authentically in your absence.\n\n**Supported platforms:** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, ChatGPT\n\n## About\n\n- **Framework:** Created by [Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com/) - [read the original article](https://www.anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/)\n- **Skill implementation:** [Olaf Alders](https://github.com/oalders)\n- The motivation: [my blog post](https://www.olafalders.com/2026/01/15/can-others-explain-my-work-without-me/)\n- **Status:** Unofficial implementation - Anil Dash is not affiliated with or responsible for this project\n\nThis is an independent implementation created to make Anil's shareability framework easily accessible in AI coding assistants. All credit for the framework and principles goes to Anil Dash. Bug reports and issues should be directed to this repository, not to Anil.\n\n## What This Does\n\nThis plugin provides a systematic audit framework for content, applying four critical tests:\n\n1. **The Absence Test** - Can someone authentically explain this when you're not there?\n2. **The Distinctiveness Test** - Does this say what only YOU can say?\n3. **The Emotional Resonance Test** - Is this emotionally gripping or comprehensively technical?\n4. **The Values-First Test** - Are values embedded in how people naturally discuss this?\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nHere's a small snippet of what the audit found when analyzing https://prettygoodping.com, a monitoring service:\n\n**❌ The Absence Test: FAIL**\n\nCurrent messaging was too technical: \"Monitor SSL/TLS & Domain Expiry, Uptime, and Server Ping\"\n\nProblem: Heavy jargon that no one would naturally use when recommending the service. It requires technical knowledge to understand and isn't conversational.\n\n**✅ Recommended Fix:**\n\n**Before:**\n> \"Monitor SSL/TLS & Domain Expiry, Uptime, and Server Ping\"\n> \"PrettyGoodPing [Beta] is a configurable dashboard for web developers\"\n\n**After:**\n> \"Sleep better knowing your sites are being watched\"\n> \"We monitor your SSL certificates, domains, and uptime - and email you before things break. It's pretty good at it.\"\n\n*[See the complete audit below](#complete-example-audit)*\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add oalders/talk-about-us\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install talk-about-us@talk-about-us\n```\n\n### Codex\n\nTell Codex:\n\n> Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oalders/talk-about-us/main/.codex/INSTALL.md\n\nOr see [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md) for manual installation.\n\n### OpenCode\n\nTell OpenCode:\n\n> Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oalders/talk-about-us/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md\n\nOr see [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md) for manual installation.\n\n### ChatGPT\n\nCreate a [Custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor) using the contents of [SKILL.md](skills/talk-about-us/SKILL.md) as the instructions, or paste it directly into any conversation.\n\nSee [docs/README.chatgpt.md](docs/README.chatgpt.md) for detailed instructions.\n\n### Local Development\n\nClone and test locally:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/oalders/talk-about-us.git\ncd talk-about-us\nclaude --plugin-dir .\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, the Talk About Us skill becomes available to Claude Code. Claude will automatically invoke this skill when you're:\n\n- Reviewing website copy, About pages, or feature descriptions\n- Writing SEO titles and meta descriptions\n- Auditing marketing content before publication\n- Refining messaging that feels generic or jargon-heavy\n\n### Example\n\n```\nYou: Review the copy on our homepage for shareability\n\nClaude: [Automatically uses the talk-about-us skill]\nI'll audit your homepage copy using Anil Dash's shareability framework...\n\n[Performs the four tests and provides specific feedback]\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly request it:\n\n```\nYou: Use the shareability audit on this paragraph: \"We're passionate about innovation...\"\n\nClaude: [Applies the framework and suggests improvements]\n```\n\nThe plugin works with both local content and live URLs:\n\n```\nYou: Use the talk about us test to audit the content on the front page of https://www.prettygoodping.com/\n\nClaude: [Fetches the URL and applies the shareability framework to the page content]\n```\n\n## What Makes Content Shareable?\n\nContent passes the shareability test when:\n\n- A community member can naturally explain it without you present\n- It's distinctive - not a platitude any competitor could claim\n- It leads with emotional resonance, not technical details\n- Values are embedded in the natural language people use\n\n## Complete Example Audit\n\nBelow is the full audit of PrettyGoodPing's front page, demonstrating all four tests:\n\n---\n\n### Talk About Us Audit: PrettyGoodPing\n\n> **Content Summary**\n>\n> The front page presents PrettyGoodPing as a monitoring dashboard for web developers, focusing on SSL/TLS certificates, domain expiry, server ping, and uptime checks. The messaging is technical and feature-focused.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **❌ 1. The Absence Test: FAIL**\n>\n> \"Can someone authentically explain this when I'm not there?\"\n>\n> Current messaging:\n> - \"Monitor SSL/TLS & Domain Expiry, Uptime, and Server Ping\"\n> - \"PrettyGoodPing [Beta] is a configurable dashboard for web developers\"\n>\n> Issues:\n> - Heavy jargon: \"TLS/SSL,\" \"domain registrations,\" \"server uptime,\" \"URL availability\"\n> - No one would naturally say this when recommending the service\n> - Requires technical knowledge to understand what's being offered\n> - Very formal, not conversational\n>\n> What someone might actually say: \"It's a tool that watches your website stuff and emails you before things break\" - but the current copy doesn't enable this kind of natural explanation.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **❌ 2. The Distinctiveness Test: FAIL**\n>\n> \"Does this say what only WE can say?\"\n>\n> Generic phrases that any competitor could use:\n> - \"configurable dashboard for web developers\"\n> - The feature list (SSL, domain, ping, uptime) is standard for monitoring tools\n> - \"optional email alerts\" - not distinctive\n>\n> What IS distinctive:\n> - The name \"PrettyGoodPing\" has personality (modest, unpretentious)\n> - Specific limits (25 certs, 5 domains) are concrete\n> - \"Built with Perl\" goes against the grain\n>\n> Problem: The distinctive personality suggested by the name isn't carried into the copy. The messaging could belong to any monitoring service.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **❌ 3. The Emotional Resonance Test: FAIL**\n>\n> \"Is this emotionally gripping or comprehensively technical?\"\n>\n> Current approach: Comprehensively technical\n> - Lists features and limits without explaining why you should care\n> - No connection to the pain point (expired certs breaking your site, surprise downtime)\n> - No emotional benefit (peace of mind, sleeping soundly, avoiding embarrassment)\n> - Missing the \"what problem does this solve\" narrative\n>\n> Missed opportunities:\n> - The anxiety of discovering an expired SSL cert at 3am\n> - The relief of proactive monitoring\n> - The embarrassment of users seeing security warnings\n> - The simplicity of \"set it and forget it\"\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **❌ 4. The Values-First Test: FAIL**\n>\n> \"Are values embedded in how people naturally discuss this?\"\n>\n> The name suggests values: \"Pretty Good\" implies modesty, pragmatism, honesty (not overpromising \"amazing\" or \"ultimate\" monitoring)\n>\n> The copy suggests different values: Technical precision, comprehensiveness, feature completeness\n>\n> Disconnect: The personality and values aren't woven into the language. There's an opportunity to embrace the \"pretty good\" ethos - reliable, unpretentious, does what it says on the tin.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **Recommendations**\n>\n> 1. **Lead with the problem/emotion, not features**\n>\n>    ❌ \"Monitor SSL/TLS & Domain Expiry, Uptime, and Server Ping\"\n>    ✅ \"Never wake up to an expired SSL certificate again\"\n>    ✅ \"Your sites are being watched, so you can sleep\"\n>\n> 2. **Use natural, shareable language**\n>\n>    ❌ \"configurable dashboard for web developers focused on monitoring TLS/SSL certificates\"\n>    ✅ \"A pretty good way to know when your website stuff is about to expire\"\n>    ✅ \"We'll email you before your SSL certs, domains, or servers go sideways\"\n>\n> 3. **Embrace the personality from your name**\n>\n>    The \"PrettyGoodPing\" name is brilliant - modest, honest, approachable. Carry that through:\n>    - \"We're not fancy, but we're reliable\"\n>    - \"Does what it says, and does it pretty well\"\n>    - \"Simple monitoring that actually works\"\n>\n> 4. **Make it repeatable**\n>\n>    Test: Can someone explain this at a meetup without sounding robotic?\n>\n>    ❌ Current: \"It's a configurable dashboard for monitoring TLS/SSL certificates, domain registrations, server uptime, and URL availability\"\n>\n>    ✅ Better: \"It watches your SSL certificates and domains, and emails you before they expire. Pretty straightforward.\"\n>\n> 5. **Show concrete value, not just features**\n>\n>    Instead of listing emoji-decorated features, try:\n>    - \"25 SSL certificates watched 24/7\"\n>    - \"Email alerts 10 days before disaster strikes\"\n>    - \"Because finding out your cert expired from an angry user email is the worst\"\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **Specific Rewrite Suggestions**\n>\n> Hero Section (current):\n> > \"Monitor SSL/TLS & Domain Expiry, Uptime, and Server Ping\"\n> > \"PrettyGoodPing [Beta] is a configurable dashboard for web developers\"\n>\n> Hero Section (suggested):\n> > \"Sleep better knowing your sites are being watched\"\n> > \"We monitor your SSL certificates, domains, and uptime - and email you before things break. It's pretty good at it.\"\n>\n> Feature Section (current):\n> > 🔒 TLS/SSL Cert Expiry\n> > 🌐 Domain Name Expiry\n>\n> Feature Section (suggested):\n> > 🔒 Never miss an SSL renewal - We'll bug you 10 days before it expires\n> > 🌐 Your domain won't disappear - 3 weeks warning before expiry\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **Summary Score: 0/4 Tests Passed**\n>\n> The content is technically accurate but fails all four shareability tests. It's jargon-heavy, generic, emotionally flat, and doesn't embody the personality suggested by the excellent brand name.\n>\n> **Key insight:** You have a distinctive, personable name (\"PrettyGoodPing\") but corporate, generic copy. Let the personality shine through in the messaging.\n>\n> ---\n\n## Credits\n\nFramework developed by [Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com/).
