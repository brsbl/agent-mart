        "plugins/compound-teams/README.md": "# Compound Teams\n\nAgent Teams + Ralph Loops + Compound Learning — a coding factory workflow for Claude Code.\n\n## What It Does\n\nCombines three ideas into one workflow:\n\n1. **Agent Teams** — spawn coordinated teammates that work in parallel, communicate peer-to-peer, and claim tasks from a shared list\n2. **Ralph Loops** — every teammate iterates (implement → test → fix → retest) until all checks pass, never shipping broken code\n3. **Compound Learning** — after each cycle, learnings get captured in CLAUDE.md so future sessions start smarter\n\n## Install\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/tbdng/compound-teams-plugin\n/plugin install compound-teams\n```\n\nThen in any project:\n```\n/ct:setup\n```\n\nThis safely installs the workflow into your existing project without overwriting anything.\n\n## The Loop\n\n```\n/ct:plan  →  /ct:build  →  /ct:review  →  /ct:compound  →  repeat\n```\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/ct:setup` | Safe install into existing projects. Detects your stack, enables Agent Teams, augments CLAUDE.md |\n| `/ct:plan` | Research codebase + web, create task-by-task implementation plan |\n| `/ct:build` | Spawn Agent Team. Each teammate runs Ralph Loops until tests pass |\n| `/ct:review` | 3 specialized reviewers (security, architecture, correctness) |\n| `/ct:quick` | Fast build for small tasks — 1 builder + 1 verifier |\n| `/ct:compound` | Extract learnings into CLAUDE.md for next cycle |\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `ralph-loop` | Reference for the retry-until-green pattern. Max retries, escalation rules, anti-patterns |\n| `compound-learning` | How to write good CLAUDE.md entries. Format, sections, maintenance |\n\n## How /ct:build Works\n\n1. Reads your plan from `.claude/plans/`\n2. Spawns an Agent Team (builders + QA)\n3. Creates tasks in the shared task list with dependencies\n4. Each builder follows the Ralph Loop:\n   - Pick task → implement → test → fail? fix and retry → pass? lint → typecheck → commit → next task\n5. QA runs full test suite on completed tasks, creates fix tasks if needed\n6. Team lead monitors, unblocks stuck teammates, shuts down runaway loops\n7. Final test pass → clean up → report\n\n## Cost Awareness\n\nAgent Teams use more tokens than single-agent work. Each teammate has its own context window. The Ralph Loop adds iterations. Built-in safeguards prevent runaway costs:\n\n- Max 5 retries per unique error\n- Stuck teammates escalate after 3 attempts\n- Team lead shuts down teammates looping without progress\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Always start with `/ct:plan`** — good plans = fast builds\n- **Run `/ct:compound` after every meaningful session** — this is what makes it compound\n- **Use tmux split-pane mode** to watch all teammates simultaneously\n- **Use delegate mode** (Shift+Tab) during builds — lead coordinates, doesn't code\n- **Use `/ct:quick` for small stuff** — don't over-engineer a bug fix\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
