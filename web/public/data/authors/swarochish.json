Eleven legal domains. The entire Indian legal framework at your fingertips.**\n\n---\n\n## Why This Plugin?\n\nIndia's legal system is vast and intricate — 1,500+ statutes, 40M+ pending cases, and a legal practice that spans everything from the Indian Contract Act 1872 to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023.\n\nThis plugin gives you:\n\n- **32 specialist agents** that understand specific domains of Indian law, from contract formation to criminal defense to patent eligibility\n- **235 reference protocols** encoding statutory provisions, landmark case law, procedural rules, and calculation formulas\n- **32 slash commands** for common legal tasks — draft an RTI application, calculate gratuity, check limitation periods, prepare for trial\n- **A master orchestrator** that routes any legal query to the right specialist automatically\n\nWhether you're an advocate preparing case strategy, a law student studying for exams, an in-house counsel reviewing compliance, or a citizen navigating the legal system — this plugin makes Indian law accessible and actionable.\n\n---\n\n## Domains Covered\n\n| Domain | What's Inside |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Contract Law** | Formation, validity, breach, remedies, sale of goods, specific performance (Indian Contract Act 1872, Sale of Goods Act 1930, Specific Relief Act 1963) |\n| **Criminal Law** | IPC/BNS offences, evidence, bail, trial procedure, sentencing, general exceptions (IPC 1860 / BNS 2023, CrPC / BNSS 2023) |\n| **Corporate Law** | Companies Act 2013 compliance, formation, ROC filings, IBC insolvency, shareholder agreements |\n| **Labour Law** | Industrial disputes, termination, PF/ESI/Gratuity/Bonus calculators, retrenchment compensation |\n| **Civil Procedure** | CPC suits, evidence examination, limitation periods, injunctions, appeals |\n| **Property Law** | Transfer of Property Act, title verification, due diligence, registration |\n| **Intellectual Property** | Patents (55 protocols), trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, IP portfolio strategy |\n| **Consumer Protection** | Consumer complaints (CPA 2019), RERA, e-commerce disputes |\n| **Constitutional & Civic Law** | Writs (Article 32/226), RTI applications, PIL guidance, tribunal procedures |\n| **ADR** | Arbitration (with 2015/2019/2021 amendments), mediation, conciliation |\n| **Cyber Law** | IT Act offences, digital evidence (Section 65B), electronic records |\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nRequires [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) v1.0.33 or later.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/swarochish/indian-law-plugin.git\n\n# Load the plugin\nclaude --plugin-dir ./indian-law-plugin\n```\n\nOr add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"path/to/indian-law-plugin\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Master command — routes any legal query to the right specialist\n/indian-law:ultimate-indian-law\n\n# Contract analysis\n/indian-law:analyze-contract\n/indian-law:draft-contract\n\n# Criminal law\n/indian-law:criminal-law-advice\n/indian-law:bail-application\n/indian-law:file-fir\n\n# Civic rights\n/indian-law:file-rti\n/indian-law:check-writ\n/indian-law:pil-viability\n\n# Labour disputes\n/indian-law:resolve-labour-dispute\n/indian-law:practice-labour-case\n\n# Litigation\n/indian-law:civil-suit\n/indian-law:calculate-limitation\n/indian-law:trial-prep\n/indian-law:appeal-strategy\n\n# Property & IP\n/indian-law:property-verify\n/indian-law:patent-check\n```\n\nSee `commands/` for all 32 available commands.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\nUser Query\n    |\n    v\nindian-law-master-orchestrator\n    |\n    +---> Classifies query by legal domain\n    |\n    +---> Routes to specialist agent (1 of 32)\n    |         |\n    |         +---> Agent reads relevant protocols (235 total)\n    |         |\n    |         +---> Applies domain-specific analysis framework\n    |         |\n    |         +---> Returns structured legal analysis\n    |\n    v\nStructured Response with:\n  - Applicable statutes & sections\n  - Landmark case citations\n  - Step-by-step procedure\n  - Risk assessment\n  - Actionable next steps\n```\n\n**Multi-agent architecture**: Each legal domain has a dedicated specialist agent trained on domain-specific protocols. The master orchestrator handles routing, and agents can collaborate on cross-domain queries (e.g., a property dispute that involves contract law and civil procedure).\n\n**Protocol-backed knowledge**: Every agent draws from curated reference protocols that encode statutory provisions, judicial interpretations, procedural rules, and worked examples — not generic training data.\n\n---\n\n## What's Inside\n\n| Component | Count | Description |\n|-----------|-------|-------------|\n| Agents | 32 | Specialist agents covering all legal domains |\n| Commands | 32 | Slash commands for common legal tasks |\n| Skills | 13 | Reusable analytical capabilities |\n| Protocols | 235 | Reference knowledge base across 12 directories |\n| **Total** | **312** | |\n\n### Key Agents\n\n| Agent | Domain |\n|-------|--------|\n| `indian-law-master-orchestrator` | Routes queries to appropriate specialist |\n| `contract-law-specialist` | Contract formation, validity, breach, remedies |\n| `criminal-law-specialist` | IPC/BNS offences, defense, prosecution strategy |\n| `corporate-compliance-officer` | Companies Act compliance, ROC filings, annual returns |\n| `labour-dispute-strategist` | Industrial disputes, termination, statutory benefits |\n| `property-law-specialist` | Property transactions, title verification, due diligence |\n| `ip-law-specialist` | Patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets |\n| `rti-specialist` | Right to Information applications and appeals |\n| `mock-court-simulator` | Practice court proceedings and oral arguments |\n| `evidence-analyst` | Evidence admissibility, Section 65B, chain of custody |\n| `adr-specialist` | Arbitration, mediation, conciliation under A&C Act |\n\n### Key Skills\n\n| Skill | What It Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `contract-analyzer` | Systematic contract validity analysis under Indian Contract Act |\n| `criminal-case-analyzer` | 6-phase criminal case analysis framework |\n| `labour-law-calculator` | Calculate PF, ESI, Gratuity, Bonus, Retrenchment Compensation |\n| `limitation-calculator` | Determine limitation periods under the Limitation Act |\n| `writ-jurisdiction-advisor` | Which writ to file, which court, locus standi assessment |\n| `legal-opinion-drafter` | Structure legal opinions with statutory analysis |\n| `rti-application-drafter` | Draft RTI applications with proper formatting |\n\n### Protocol Coverage\n\n```\nprotocols/\n├── contract_law/              18 protocols (formation, breach, remedies, special contracts)\n├── criminal_law/              30 protocols (offences, evidence, procedure, bail, sentencing)\n├── corporate_law/             26 protocols (formation, compliance, IBC, directors, meetings)\n├── labour_law/                21 protocols (disputes, PF, ESI, gratuity, bonus, termination)\n├── civil_procedure/           12 protocols (suits, evidence, limitation, injunctions, appeals)\n├── property_law/               7 protocols (transfer, registration, due diligence)\n├── intellectual_property/      8 protocols (patents, trademarks, copyrights)\n├── consumer_misc/              7 protocols (consumer protection, RERA, e-commerce)\n├── indian_civic_law/          12 protocols (writs, RTI, PIL, tribunals, local governance)\n├── indian_law/                 9 protocols (ADR, limitation, property, consumer, IP)\n└── extracted/\n    ├── indian-law/            30 protocols (cross-domain reference)\n    └── indian-patent-law/     55 protocols (comprehensive patent law)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Current as of 2025\n\nThis plugin is updated for the latest Indian legal framework:\n\n- **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023** (BNS) — replaces IPC for offences after July 1, 2024\n- **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023** (BNSS) — replaces CrPC\n- **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023** (BSA) — replaces Indian Evidence Act\n- **Arbitration Act amendments** (2015, 2019, 2021)\n- **COVID-19 limitation extensions** (Supreme Court orders 2020-2021)\n- **Consumer Protection Act 2019** (replaces 1986 Act)\n- **Companies Act 2013 amendments** through 2024\n\n---\n\n## Structure\n\n```\nindian-law-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json    Plugin manifest\n├── LICENSE                       MIT License\n├── README.md                     This file\n├── agents/                       32 specialist agents\n├── commands/                     32 slash commands\n├── skills/                       13 skill directories (each with SKILL.md)\n└── protocols/                    235 reference protocols across 12 directories\n```\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
