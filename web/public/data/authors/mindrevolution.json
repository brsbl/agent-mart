        "README.md": "# mill\n\nThink it through. Ship it right. Sharper every cycle.\n\nmill is a skill pack for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that brings structure to AI-assisted software delivery. Markdown skills orchestrate Claude Code's native tools to manage the full workflow — from intent to verified Pull Request.\n\nYou describe intent. mill asks the right questions, writes a complete spec, assembles a team of agents, implements in verified steps, and opens a PR. Every cycle feeds learnings back into your project's knowledge base. The more you ship, the sharper it gets.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add mindrevolution/mill\n/plugin install mill@mindrevolution\n```\n\nThen in your project:\n\n```\n/mill:init                # Set up .mill/ directory\n/mill:spec                # Think through what to build → GitHub Issue\n/mill:ship 42             # Assemble team, implement, verify → PR\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Knowledge\n        G[Ground]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Delivery\n        I[Idea] --> S[Spec] --> X[Ship]\n    end\n\n    G -.->|informs| I\n    G -.->|validates| S\n    G -.->|guides| X\n\n    X -.->|learnings| G\n```\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/mill:init` | Initialize `.mill/` — directory structure and gitignore |\n| `/mill:ground` | Build your project's knowledge base — personas, conventions, decisions |\n| `/mill:idea` | Capture a rough thought — 30 days to develop into a spec or drop with learnings |\n| `/mill:spec` | Turn intent into a precise, self-contained spec → published as GitHub Issue |\n| `/mill:ship` | Assemble a team of agents, implement a spec, verify independently → PR |\n| `/mill:warmup` | Orient Claude to your codebase — architecture, patterns, recent changes |\n\n## Agent Teams\n\nWhen you `/mill:ship`, mill doesn't just generate code in a single pass. It assembles a team:\n\n1. **Lead** — reads the spec, determines team size, delegates work, manages cross-team contracts\n2. **Implementer(s)** — 1-4 agents with explicit file ownership boundaries, working in parallel where possible\n3. **Verifier** — a separate agent with clean context that reviews the full changeset against every spec criterion\n\nThe verifier never sees the implementer's reasoning. This structural independence catches what self-review misses.\n\n## The Learning Loop\n\nEvery skill writes observations — patterns discovered, gaps noticed, conventions found. `/mill:ground` curates these into permanent project knowledge: personas, rules, vocabulary, architectural decisions. The next spec is informed by what the last ship learned.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- `gh` CLI ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)) — authenticated\n- Git repository on GitHub\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full reference — architecture, project structure, skill details, and development guide.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n"
