Capture non-trivial learnings about edge cases, design decisions, patterns, and implementation details. Activate when building complex code where institutional knowledge should be preserved. Log to .claude/insights/ and help transfer key learnings to CLAUDE.md.\n---\n\n# Build Insights Logger\n\n## Overview\n\nMaintain a running log of meaningful insights, discoveries, and decisions made during coding sessions. Capture non-trivial learnings about requirements, edge cases, design considerations, implementation details, and coding patterns that emerge during development.\n\n**Target outcome**: Preserve institutional knowledge and track the evolution of the codebase by logging insights to session files in `.claude/insights/`, then selectively transferring valuable learnings to CLAUDE.md.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nActivate automatically when:\n- Working on complex implementations with non-trivial design decisions\n- Discovering edge cases or unexpected behaviors\n- Making architectural or performance trade-offs\n- Implementing security-sensitive features\n- Building features where institutional knowledge matters\n\nDo not activate for:\n- Simple bug fixes or trivial changes\n- Routine refactoring without architectural impact\n- Syntax corrections or typos\n\n## File Structure & Session Management\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\n.claude/\n└── insights/\n    ├── session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md (current session)\n    └── archive/\n        └── session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md (archived sessions)\n```\n\n### Session File Naming\n- **Current session**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`\n- **Format**: Use timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` format\n- **Location**: `.claude/insights/` for active sessions\n- **Archive location**: `.claude/insights/archive/` for completed sessions\n\n### Session Creation\n- Create new session file when first insight is logged in a new Claude Code session\n- One file per Claude Code session\n- Each session file is independent - no cross-session merging\n\n### Session File Format\nEach session file contains insights in markdown format with this structure:\n```markdown\n# Insights Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n### [Category]: [Brief Title]\nFiles: `path/to/file.ts`, `another/file.ts`\nTags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n[Clear, concise description of the insight]\n\n[Optional: Brief code snippet if essential - max 3-5 lines]\n\n---\n\n### [Next insight...]\n```\n\n## Logging Insights Workflow\n\n### When to Log Insights\n\n**Automatic logging triggers** (Claude decides these are insight-worthy):\n- Discovery of non-trivial edge cases\n- New requirements emerging during implementation\n- Design decisions and their rationale\n- Performance considerations or optimizations\n- Security implications discovered\n- Dependency choices and trade-offs\n- Architectural patterns adopted\n- Testing strategies implemented\n- Error handling approaches\n- API design decisions\n- State management patterns\n- Data validation rules\n\n**Explicit user requests**:\n- User says \"log this insight\", \"remember this\", or \"capture this learning\"\n- User asks to note specific discoveries\n- User highlights something for future reference\n\n### What NOT to Log\n- Trivial or obvious details (e.g., \"created a new file\")\n- Standard boilerplate code\n- Common language features\n- Syntax corrections or typos\n- Routine refactoring without architectural impact\n- Self-evident code comments\n\n### Logging Process\n\n**Step 1: Identify the insight**\n- Evaluate whether the discovery/decision meets insight criteria\n- When in doubt, log it (user can filter during review)\n\n**Step 2: Create or open session file**\n- If no session file exists for current session, create `.claude/insights/session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`\n- If session file exists, open it for appending\n\n**Step 3: Format the insight**\nUse this template:\n```markdown\n### [Category]: [Brief Title]\nFiles: `path/to/file.ts`, `another/file.ts`\nTags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n[Clear, concise description of the insight]\n\n[Optional: Brief code snippet if essential - max 3-5 lines]\n```\n\n**Category examples**:\n- Architecture, Edge Cases, Performance, Testing, Security\n- Dependencies, Patterns, API Design, State Management\n- Error Handling, Data Flow, Validation\n\n**Tag guidelines**:\n- Use lowercase with hyphens: `#error-handling`, `#api-design`\n- 2-4 tags per insight\n- Common tags: `#performance`, `#security`, `#edge-cases`, `#patterns`, `#testing`, `#api`, `#architecture`\n\n**Description guidelines**:\n- **Clear and concise**: Get to the point quickly\n- **Explain WHY**: Why is this valuable? What problem does it solve?\n- **Context**: What led to this discovery?\n- **Action taken**: What decision was made?\n- **1-3 paragraphs maximum**\n\n**Code snippet rules** (optional):\n- Only include if essential to understanding\n- Maximum 3-5 lines\n- Add comments to highlight key points\n- Label \"good\" vs \"bad\" when comparing approaches\n- Prefer conceptual explanation over code\n\n**Step 4: Append to session file**\n- Add insight to the end of the session file\n- Separate insights with `---` divider\n\n**Step 5: Notify user**\n- Show brief notification: `📝 Logged insight about [topic]`\n- Keep it one line - don't show full insight content\n- Example: `📝 Logged insight about null handling in API responses`\n\n### Logging Frequency\n- Add insights progressively as discovered\n- Don't wait until end of session\n- Multiple insights per session is expected and encouraged\n\n## Review & Selection Workflow\n\n### Initiating Review\n- **User-initiated only**: User asks \"review insights\", \"show me what we learned\", \"summarize insights\"\n- **No automatic suggestions**: Do not proactively suggest reviewing\n\n### Review Process\n\n**Step 1: Consolidation**\n- Read current session insights file from `.claude/insights/session-*.md`\n- Identify related or redundant insights\n- Consolidate similar insights into cohesive entries\n- Refine wording for clarity\n\n**Step 2: Present insights**\nPresent in this format:\n```\nBased on this session, here are the key insights captured:\n\n**[Category Group]**\n\n1/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\n2/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\n**[Another Category Group]**\n\n3/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\nWhich insights would you like to add to CLAUDE.md? Reply with numbers (e.g., \"1, 3\" or \"all\").\n```\n\n**Presentation guidelines**:\n- Number each insight (1/, 2/, 3/, etc.)\n- Group by category when helpful\n- Include brief explanation of value for each\n- Keep explanations concise (1-2 sentences)\n\n**Step 3: User selection**\n- User responds with numbers: \"1, 3\" or \"1,2,3\" or \"all\" or \"none\"\n- Parse user's selection\n\n**Step 4: Add to CLAUDE.md**\n- Read existing CLAUDE.md (or create if doesn't exist)\n- Add selected insights under appropriate section\n- Format appropriately for CLAUDE.md context\n- Create new section if needed (e.g., \"## Insights & Learnings\")\n- Confirm what was added to user\n\n**Step 5: Archive session file**\n- After adding insights to CLAUDE.md, move session file to archive\n- Move from `.claude/insights/session-*.md` to `.claude/insights/archive/session-*.md`\n- Create archive directory if it doesn't exist\n- Confirm archiving to user\n\n### No Insights Scenario\nIf user asks to review and no insights were logged:\n- Respond: \"No insights were captured in this session yet.\"\n- Don't create empty session files\n\n### Multiple Review Requests\n- User can request review multiple times per session\n- Show all insights logged so far\n- If some were previously added to CLAUDE.md, indicate which ones\n\n### CLAUDE.md Doesn't Exist\n- If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it when adding insights\n- Use standard structure with appropriate sections\n- Add insights under \"## Insights & Learnings\" section\n\n## Archiving & Cleanup\n\n### Automatic Archiving\n- **Trigger**: After user selects insights and they're added to CLAUDE.md\n- **Action**: Move session file from `.claude/insights/` to `.claude/insights/archive/`\n- **Naming**: Keep original filename (e.g., `session-2025-11-17-143022.md`)\n- **Directory creation**: Create `.claude/insights/archive/` if it doesn't exist\n\n### Manual Deletion Option\nUser can request deletion instead of archiving:\n- **Trigger phrases**: \"delete the insights log\", \"clear insights instead of archiving\", \"remove insights file\"\n- **Confirmation**: Ask for confirmation before deleting\n- **Action**: Delete the session file completely instead of archiving\n\n### Cleanup Commands\n- \"archive current session\" - move to archive\n- \"delete current session\" - delete completely (with confirmation)\n- \"clean up old archives\" - user specifies which archived files to remove\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n### Insight Quality Criteria\n1. **Non-trivial**: Adds genuine value to understanding the codebase\n2. **Actionable**: Contains information useful for future development\n3. **Specific**: Tied to concrete decisions or discoveries, not generic advice\n4. **Contextual**: Explains why this matters for this specific project\n\n### When in Doubt\n- **Better to log**: If uncertain whether something is insight-worthy, log it\n- **User can filter**: During review, user decides what's valuable for CLAUDE.md\n- **Better too many than too few**: Session log is temporary; missing insights are lost\n\n### Writing Style\n- **Concise**: Shorter entries are better\n- **Clear**: Use plain language, avoid jargon unless necessary\n- **Focused**: One insight per entry, don't combine unrelated learnings\n- **Practical**: Focus on practical implications, not theoretical concepts\n\n### Category Selection\n- Choose specific, descriptive categories\n- Create new categories when existing ones don't fit\n- Avoid generic categories like \"General\" or \"Miscellaneous\"\n- Categories should help organize related insights\n\n### Tag Selection\n- Use 2-4 tags per insight\n- Tags should aid searchability and filtering\n- Use consistent tag names (check existing tags in file first)\n- Prefer specific tags over broad ones\n\n## Edge Cases & Special Scenarios\n\n### Session File Already Exists\n- If timestamp collision (unlikely), append a letter: `session-2025-11-17-143022-a.md`\n- Log warning about timestamp collision\n\n### Archive Directory Doesn't Exist\n- Create `.claude/insights/archive/` directory when first archiving\n- Don't error if it doesn't exist\n\n### Empty Session\n- Don't create session file until first insight is logged\n- If no insights logged, no file created\n\n### Long Sessions with Many Insights\n- No limit on insights per session\n- File can grow as large as needed\n- Consolidate during review to prevent overwhelming user\n\n## Example Insight Entry\n\n```markdown\n### Edge Case: Null handling in API responses\nFiles: `api/users.ts`, `types/user.ts`\nTags: #api #edge-cases #error-handling\n2025-11-17 14:30:22\n\nDiscovered that third-party user API can return null for email field even though documentation states it's required. Added validation layer with fallback to 'no-email@placeholder.com' for system processes to prevent downstream crashes.\n\n// Good approach\nconst email = userData.email ?? 'no-email@placeholder.com';\n\n// Avoid - will crash downstream\nconst email = userData.email; // assumes always present\n```\n"
