        "README.md": "# Build Insights Logger Skill for Claude Code\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace providing automatic logging of meaningful insights, discoveries, and decisions during coding sessions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis marketplace contains a specialized skill that automatically captures non-trivial learnings about edge cases, design decisions, patterns, and implementation details during development. The skill logs insights to session files in `.claude/insights/` and helps transfer valuable learnings to CLAUDE.md for long-term institutional knowledge preservation.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo add this marketplace to your Claude Code installation:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add nathanonn/claude-skill-build-insights-logger\n```\n\nAfter adding the marketplace, the `build-insights-logger` skill will be available for installation and will automatically activate when building complex code where institutional knowledge should be preserved.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### build-insights-logger\n\n**Type:** Project Skill (Managed)\n\n**Description:** Automatically log meaningful insights, discoveries, and decisions during coding sessions to preserve institutional knowledge and track codebase evolution.\n\n**Features:**\n\n-   Automatic logging of insights during complex implementations\n-   Captures non-trivial learnings about:\n    -   Edge cases and unexpected behaviors\n    -   Design decisions and architectural trade-offs\n    -   Performance and security considerations\n    -   API design patterns and state management\n    -   Testing strategies and error handling approaches\n-   Session-based logging to `.claude/insights/` directory\n-   Interactive review workflow for selecting insights to preserve\n-   Transfer valuable learnings to CLAUDE.md\n-   Archive completed sessions for historical reference\n\n**When It Activates:**\n\nThe skill automatically activates when:\n-   Working on complex implementations with non-trivial design decisions\n-   Discovering edge cases or unexpected behaviors\n-   Making architectural or performance trade-offs\n-   Implementing security-sensitive features\n-   Building features where institutional knowledge matters\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, the skill works in two phases:\n\n### 1. Automatic Logging\n\nDuring development, Claude will automatically log insights as they're discovered:\n\n```\n📝 Logged insight about null handling in API responses\n📝 Logged insight about performance optimization in data loading\n📝 Logged insight about state management pattern selection\n```\n\nInsights are logged to timestamped session files in `.claude/insights/session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`\n\n### 2. Review & Selection\n\nWhen you're ready to preserve key learnings, ask Claude to review:\n\n-   \"Review insights\" - See all insights from the current session\n-   \"Show me what we learned\" - Review and select insights to add to CLAUDE.md\n-   \"Summarize insights\" - Get an overview of captured learnings\n\nClaude will present insights grouped by category, and you can select which ones to transfer to CLAUDE.md for permanent reference.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   Claude Code CLI installed and configured\n-   No additional dependencies required\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\n.claude/\n└── skills/\n    └── build-insights-logger/\n        └── SKILL.md              # Skill definition and complete documentation\n```\n\n## Development\n\nTo test this marketplace locally:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/claude-skill-build-insights-logger\n```\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, questions, or contributions, please visit:\n\n-   Repository: https://github.com/nathanonn/claude-skill-build-insights-logger\n-   Contact: hello@nathanonn.com\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see LICENSE file for details\n\n## About Build Insights Logger\n\nBuild Insights Logger helps development teams capture and preserve institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost. By automatically logging meaningful discoveries and decisions during coding sessions, it creates a living history of why the codebase evolved the way it did - making onboarding easier, preventing repeated mistakes, and preserving valuable context for future developers.\n"
