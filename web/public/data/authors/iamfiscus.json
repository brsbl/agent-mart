        "README.md": "# jd-for-andrew\n\nA Claude Code plugin built specifically for Andrew Wilkinson.\n\n---\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### Skills\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `design-roast` | MetaLab-quality design critiques for any URL |\n| `tiny-memo` | Berkshire-style acquisition memos in seconds |\n| `andrew-would-hate-this` | Corporate BS detector. Paste text, get it roasted. |\n| `about-jd` | Ask me anything about my background |\n| `aeropress` | Coffee break companion (yes, I know you own the company) |\n\n### Agents\n\n| Agent | What it does |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `vibe-coder` | Describe what you want, watch it get built |\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### As a Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nAdd this marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add iamfiscus/jd-for-andrew\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install jd-for-andrew@jd-for-andrew\n```\n\nOr add via GitHub URL:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/iamfiscus/jd-for-andrew.git\n```\n\n### As a Local Plugin\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/iamfiscus/jd-for-andrew.git\n\n# Install in Claude Code\nclaude plugins add ./jd-for-andrew\n```\n\nOr just use it in the sandbox on the landing page. Your call.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Get a design critique\n> roast https://tiny.com\n\n# Generate an acquisition memo\n> tiny-memo Letterboxd\n\n# Check your copy for corporate BS\n> andrew-would-hate-this \"Let's leverage our synergies\"\n\n# Learn about me\n> who is JD\n\n# Take a coffee break\n> aeropress\n```\n\n---\n\n## Why I Built This\n\nYou're talking about vibe coding. \n\nI built you a tool instead.\n\nThis plugin demonstrates:\n- **Plugin development** — Not many people know how to build these yet\n- **Design thinking** — The `design-roast` skill shows I understand MetaLab's principles\n- **Business understanding** — The `tiny-memo` skill shows I get Tiny's investment thesis\n- **Attention to detail** — You're reading a README, and it's formatted properly\n- **Personality** — The Aeropress easter egg exists\n\n---\n\n## The Pitch\n\nI ship fast. I have taste. I don't need hand-holding.\n\nIf you want to see what I can build, you're looking at it.\n\n---\n\n## Built With\n\n- Claude Code\n- Coffee\n- The realization that cover letters are a waste of everyone's time\n\n---\n\n*This plugin took 2 hours to build.*\n"
