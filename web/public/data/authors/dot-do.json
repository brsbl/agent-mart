Your workers are AI agents and humans—and they run on Cloudflare Workers.\n\nBoth kinds of workers. Working for you.\n\n## You're a Founder\n\nYou need a team, but you're early. Maybe it's just you.\n\n```typescript\nimport { product, engineering, marketing } from 'teams.do'\n\nconst mvp = await product`define the MVP`\nconst app = await engineering`build ${mvp}`\nawait marketing`launch ${app}`\n```\n\nThat's your startup. Running.\n\n## Meet Your Team\n\n| Agent | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| **Priya** | Product—specs, roadmaps, priorities |\n| **Ralph** | Engineering—builds what you need |\n| **Tom** | Tech Lead—architecture, code review |\n| **Rae** | Frontend—React, UI, accessibility |\n| **Mark** | Marketing—copy, content, launches |\n| **Sally** | Sales—outreach, demos, closing |\n| **Quinn** | QA—testing, edge cases, quality |\n\nEach agent has real identity—email, GitHub account, avatar. When Tom reviews your PR, you'll see `@tom-do` commenting.\n\n## Just Talk to Them\n\n```typescript\nimport { priya, ralph, tom, mark, quinn } from 'agents.do'\n\nawait priya`what should we build next?`\nawait ralph`implement the user dashboard`\nawait tom`review the pull request`\nawait mark`write a blog post about our launch`\nawait quinn`test ${feature} thoroughly`\n```\n\nNo method names. No parameters. Just say what you want.\n\n## Work Flows Naturally\n\n```typescript\nconst spec = await priya`spec out user authentication`\nconst code = await ralph`build ${spec}`\nconst reviewed = await tom`review ${code}`\nconst docs = await mark`document ${reviewed}`\n```\n\nOr pipeline an entire sprint:\n\n```typescript\nconst sprint = await priya`plan the sprint`\n  .map(issue => ralph`build ${issue}`)\n  .map(code => tom`review ${code}`)\n```\n\nThe `.map()` isn't JavaScript's—it's a remote operation. The callback is recorded, not executed. The server receives the entire pipeline and executes it in one pass.\n\n## Automate Everything\n\nComplex processes run themselves:\n\n```typescript\nimport { on } from 'workflows.do'\nimport { priya, ralph, tom, quinn, mark, sally } from 'agents.do'\n\non.Idea.captured(async idea => {\n  const product = await priya`brainstorm ${idea}`\n  const backlog = await priya.plan(product)\n\n  for (const issue of backlog.ready) {\n    const pr = await ralph`implement ${issue}`\n\n    do await ralph`update ${pr}`\n    while (!await pr.approvedBy(quinn, tom, priya))\n\n    await pr.merge()\n  }\n\n  await mark`document and launch ${product}`\n  await sally`start outbound for ${product}`\n})\n```\n\nEvent-driven. PR-based. Real development workflow.\n\n## Humans When It Matters\n\nAI does the work. Humans make the decisions.\n\n```typescript\nimport { legal, ceo } from 'humans.do'\n\nconst contract = await legal`review this agreement`\nconst approved = await ceo`approve the partnership`\n```\n\nSame syntax. Messages go to Slack, email, or wherever your humans are. Your workflow waits for their response.\n\n## Business-as-Code\n\nDefine your entire startup:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Startup } from 'startups.do'\nimport { engineering, product, sales } from 'teams.do'\nimport { dev, sales as salesWorkflow } from 'workflows.do'\n\nexport default Startup({\n  name: 'Acme AI',\n  teams: { engineering, product, sales },\n  workflows: { build: dev, sell: salesWorkflow },\n  services: ['llm.do', 'payments.do', 'org.ai'],\n})\n```\n\nThat's a company. It builds products, sells them, and grows.\n\n## Platform Services\n\nEverything you need to run a startup:\n\n| Service | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| [database.do](https://database.do) | AI-native data with cascading generation |\n| [functions.do](https://functions.do) | Code, Generative, Agentic, Human functions |\n| [workflows.do](https://workflows.do) | Event-driven orchestration |\n| [triggers.do](https://triggers.do) | Webhooks, schedules, events |\n| [searches.do](https://searches.do) | Semantic & vector search |\n| [actions.do](https://actions.do) | Tool calling & side effects |\n| [integrations.do](https://integrations.do) | Connect external services |\n| [analytics.do](https://analytics.do) | Metrics, traces, insights |\n| [payments.do](https://payments.do) | Stripe Connect billing |\n| [services.do](https://services.do) | AI-delivered service marketplace |\n| [org.ai](https://org.ai) | Identity, SSO, users, secrets |\n| [builder.domains](https://builder.domains) | Free domains for builders |\n\n```typescript\nimport { llm } from 'llm.do'\nimport { payments } from 'payments.do'\nimport { org } from 'org.ai'\n\nawait llm`summarize this article`\nawait payments.charge(customer, amount)\nawait org.users.invite(email)\n```\n\n## The Double Meaning\n\n**workers.do** runs on Cloudflare Workers—the fastest serverless runtime.\n\nYour AI agents and human team members are also workers—digital workers that work for you.\n\nBoth kinds of workers. On [workers.do](https://workers.do).\n\n## Get Started\n\n```bash\nnpm install agents.do\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { priya, ralph, tom } from 'agents.do'\n\nconst idea = await priya`what should we build?`\nconst code = await ralph`build ${idea}`\nconst shipped = await tom`review and ship ${code}`\n```\n\nYou just shipped your first feature. With a team.\n\n---\n\n**Solo founders** — Get a team without hiring one.\n\n**Small teams** — AI does the work, humans decide.\n\n**Growing startups** — Add humans without changing code.\n\n---\n\n[workers.do](https://workers.do) | [agents.do](https://agents.do) | [teams.do](https://teams.do) | [workflows.do](https://workflows.do)\n",
        "plugins/ralph-loop/README.md": "# Ralph Loop Plugin\n\nImplementation of the Ralph Wiggum technique for iterative, self-referential AI development loops in Claude Code.\n\n## What is Ralph Loop?\n\nRalph Loop is a development methodology based on continuous AI agent loops. As Geoffrey Huntley describes it: **\"Ralph is a Bash loop\"** - a simple `while true` that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt file, allowing it to iteratively improve its work until completion.\n\nThis technique is inspired by the Ralph Wiggum coding technique (named after the character from The Simpsons), embodying the philosophy of persistent iteration despite setbacks.\n\n### Core Concept\n\nThis plugin implements Ralph using a **Stop hook** that intercepts Claude's exit attempts:\n\n```bash\n# You run ONCE:\n/ralph-loop \"Your task description\" --completion-promise \"DONE\"\n\n# Then Claude Code automatically:\n# 1. Works on the task\n# 2. Tries to exit\n# 3. Stop hook blocks exit\n# 4. Stop hook feeds the SAME prompt back\n# 5. Repeat until completion\n```\n\nThe loop happens **inside your current session** - you don't need external bash loops. The Stop hook in `hooks/stop-hook.sh` creates the self-referential feedback loop by blocking normal session exit.\n\nThis creates a **self-referential feedback loop** where:\n- The prompt never changes between iterations\n- Claude's previous work persists in files\n- Each iteration sees modified files and git history\n- Claude autonomously improves by reading its own past work in files\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n/ralph-loop \"Build a REST API for todos. Requirements: CRUD operations, input validation, tests. Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when done.\" --completion-promise \"COMPLETE\" --max-iterations 50\n```\n\nClaude will:\n- Implement the API iteratively\n- Run tests and see failures\n- Fix bugs based on test output\n- Iterate until all requirements met\n- Output the completion promise when done\n\n## Commands\n\n### /ralph-loop\n\nStart a Ralph loop in your current session.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n/ralph-loop \"<prompt>\" --max-iterations <n> --completion-promise \"<text>\"\n```\n\n**Options:**\n- `--max-iterations <n>` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)\n- `--completion-promise <text>` - Phrase that signals completion\n\n### /cancel-ralph\n\nCancel the active Ralph loop.\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n/cancel-ralph\n```\n\n## Prompt Writing Best Practices\n\n### 1. Clear Completion Criteria\n\n❌ Bad: \"Build a todo API and make it good.\"\n\n✅ Good:\n```markdown\nBuild a REST API for todos.\n\nWhen complete:\n- All CRUD endpoints working\n- Input validation in place\n- Tests passing (coverage > 80%)\n- README with API docs\n- Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>\n```\n\n### 2. Incremental Goals\n\n❌ Bad: \"Create a complete e-commerce platform.\"\n\n✅ Good:\n```markdown\nPhase 1: User authentication (JWT, tests)\nPhase 2: Product catalog (list/search, tests)\nPhase 3: Shopping cart (add/remove, tests)\n\nOutput <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all phases done.\n```\n\n### 3. Self-Correction\n\n❌ Bad: \"Write code for feature X.\"\n\n✅ Good:\n```markdown\nImplement feature X following TDD:\n1. Write failing tests\n2. Implement feature\n3. Run tests\n4. If any fail, debug and fix\n5. Refactor if needed\n6. Repeat until all green\n7. Output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>\n```\n\n### 4. Escape Hatches\n\nAlways use `--max-iterations` as a safety net to prevent infinite loops on impossible tasks:\n\n```bash\n# Recommended: Always set a reasonable iteration limit\n/ralph-loop \"Try to implement feature X\" --max-iterations 20\n\n# In your prompt, include what to do if stuck:\n# \"After 15 iterations, if not complete:\n#  - Document what's blocking progress\n#  - List what was attempted\n#  - Suggest alternative approaches\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The `--completion-promise` uses exact string matching, so you cannot use it for multiple completion conditions (like \"SUCCESS\" vs \"BLOCKED\"). Always rely on `--max-iterations` as your primary safety mechanism.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nRalph embodies several key principles:\n\n### 1. Iteration > Perfection\nDon't aim for perfect on first try. Let the loop refine the work.\n\n### 2. Failures Are Data\n\"Deterministically bad\" means failures are predictable and informative. Use them to tune prompts.\n\n### 3. Operator Skill Matters\nSuccess depends on writing good prompts, not just having a good model.\n\n### 4. Persistence Wins\nKeep trying until success. The loop handles retry logic automatically.\n\n## When to Use Ralph\n\n**Good for:**\n- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria\n- Tasks requiring iteration and refinement (e.g., getting tests to pass)\n- Greenfield projects where you can walk away\n- Tasks with automatic verification (tests, linters)\n\n**Not good for:**\n- Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions\n- One-shot operations\n- Tasks with unclear success criteria\n- Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead)\n\n## Real-World Results\n\n- Successfully generated 6 repositories overnight in Y Combinator hackathon testing\n- One $50k contract completed for $297 in API costs\n- Created entire programming language (\"cursed\") over 3 months using this approach\n\n## Learn More\n\n- Original technique: https://ghuntley.com/ralph/\n- Ralph Orchestrator: https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator\n\n## For Help\n\nRun `/help` in Claude Code for detailed command reference and examples.\n",
