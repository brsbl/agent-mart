Write once, use everywhere.\n\nThis repository contains prompt templates we've been using internally, now packaged as skills and open-sourced for the community.\n\n## About Agent Skills\n\nSkills teach AI agents how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way. Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata that agents use.\n\nLearn more about the Agent Skills standard at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [git-commit-message](skills/git-commit-message) | Analyze uncommitted changes and suggest English commit messages in Conventional Commits format |\n| [internal-context-setup](skills/internal-context-setup) | Design and scaffold the internal-context/ folder structure for repository internal knowledge |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Codex\n\nSkills can be installed in Codex using the `$skill-installer` with the GitHub URL:\n\n```\n$skill-installer install https://github.com/fingersnap-dev/skills/tree/main/skills/git-commit-message\n```\n\n> After installing a skill, restart Codex to pick up new skills.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nAdd the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add fingersnap-dev/skills\n/plugin install git-commit-message@fingersnap-skills\n```\n\nAfter installing, you can use the skill by mentioning it in your prompt:\n\n> \"Use the git-commit-message skill to suggest commit messages for my current changes\"\n\n## License\n\nEach skill's license can be found in the `LICENSE.txt` file within its directory. Most skills in this repository are released under the MIT License.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
