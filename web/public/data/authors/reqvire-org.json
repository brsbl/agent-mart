Enforce clear specifications and generate code that stays tied to its originating requirements.\n\n- **Automated Traceability**  \n  Maintain instant, bidirectional links between requirements, code, tests, and artifacts.\n\n- **Verification & Validation**  \n  Track verifications, ensure coverage, and validate that implementations meet intended behavior.\n\n- **Smart Change Propagation**  \n  Identify impacted parts of the system and help propagate requirement changes consistently across the model and codebase.\n\n- **Seamless Integration**  \n  Works naturally with branches, pull requests, reviews, and CI/CD. No workflow disruption—just added intelligence.\n\n\n## Get Started\n\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nTo install the Reqvire CLI:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nFor detailed CLI installation options, see the [Installation Guide](https://www.reqvire.org/user_guide#installation).\n\n#### Installing the Claude Code Plugin\n\nBefore installing the plugin, ensure you have:\n1. **Claude Code** installed (available at [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code))\n\n\nThe Reqvire plugin is available through the reqvire-org marketplace for Claude Code:\n\n1. **Add the marketplace** - In Claude Code, run:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/reqvire-org/reqvire\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the plugin** - Then run:\n   ```\n   /plugin install reqvire@reqvire-org\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Claude Code to activate the plugin\n\nTo read more about plugin usage see the [Claude Plugin](https://www.reqvire.org/claude_plugin.html).\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **[Documentation](https://www.reqvire.org)** - Learn how to use Reqvire\n- **[Browse Model](https://reqvire-org.github.io/reqvire/)** - Explore Reqvire's own specifications\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to **Reqvire**!
