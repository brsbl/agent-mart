        "README.md": "# code-factory\n\nrtfpessoa's personal [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) marketplace -- a collection of plugins, skills, and agent definitions that extend AI coding assistants with structured workflows for execution planning, git operations, and code understanding.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Command | Plugin | Purpose |\n|---------|--------|---------|\n| `/do` | productivity | Orchestrate feature development with lifecycle tracking |\n| `/debug` | productivity | Systematic debugging with root cause investigation |\n| `/execplan` | productivity | Create, review, execute, or resume execution plans |\n| `/doc` | productivity | Create, update, improve, or audit Markdown docs |\n| `/workspace` | productivity | Set up Claude Code configuration and plugins |\n| `/reflect` | productivity | Capture session learnings and update knowledge files |\n| `/skill-workbench` | productivity | Create and improve skills in this marketplace |\n| `/commit` | git | Create a structured git commit |\n| `/atcommit` | git | Validate and organize atomic commits |\n| `/pr` | git | Create a GitHub pull request |\n| `/branch` | git | Create a well-named feature branch |\n| `/worktree` | git | Create an isolated git worktree |\n| `/review` | code | Review a pull request with structured feedback |\n| `/tour` | code | Guided code walkthrough (interactive or written) |\n\n## Plugins\n\n### productivity\n\nProductivity skills -- feature development lifecycle, systematic debugging, documentation management, execution planning, workspace setup, and skill workbench.\n\n**Skills:**\n\n- `/do` -- Orchestrate feature development with full lifecycle management. Multi-phase workflow (RESEARCH -> PLAN -> EXECUTE -> VALIDATE -> DONE) with resumable state, specialized subagents, and atomic commits. Supports interactive and autonomous modes.\n- `/debug` -- Systematic debugging with enforced root cause investigation. Four-phase workflow (REPRODUCE -> INVESTIGATE -> FIX -> VERIFY) with persistent state, hypothesis tracking, and defense-in-depth validation. Leverages explorer and researcher agents for evidence gathering.\n- `/doc` -- Manage Markdown documentation lifecycle: create, update, improve, maintain, and audit. Supports Confluence sync via ddoc. Includes templates for runbooks, guides, references, tutorials, and ADRs.\n- `/execplan` -- Create, execute, review, or resume an ExecPlan. Supports four modes: author (write a new plan), review (interactive walkthrough with feedback), execute (run a plan from the start), and resume (continue an in-progress plan).\n- `/workspace` -- Set up and manage Claude Code configuration. Bootstraps the code-factory plugin marketplace, symlinks configuration files, and manages MCP server settings.\n- `/reflect` -- Capture session learnings and update knowledge files. Extracts conventions, corrections, patterns, and gotchas from the current session. Uses confidence-based routing: high-confidence learnings are auto-applied, medium-confidence ones are queued for human review.\n- `/skill-workbench` -- Create new skills or improve existing ones in this plugin marketplace. Supports two modes: CREATE (scaffold a new skill with frontmatter, structure, and OpenCode command) and IMPROVE (audit skills for clarity, conciseness, and completeness; apply improvements directly).\n\n**Agents:**\n\n- `execplan` -- A specialized agent persona for authoring and executing ExecPlans. Resolves ambiguities autonomously, commits frequently, and breaks work into independently verifiable milestones.\n- `orchestrator` -- Orchestrates multi-phase workflows through a state machine. Single writer of FEATURE.md state files.\n- `explorer` -- Read-only codebase exploration. Maps architecture, conventions, and integration points.\n- `researcher` -- Domain research agent. Searches Confluence, documentation, and web resources.\n- `planner` -- Plan authoring. Converts research into actionable execution plans with milestones and tasks.\n- `reviewer` -- Plan review. Critically analyzes plans for completeness, safety, and executability.\n- `spec-reviewer` -- Spec compliance review. Verifies implementation matches task specification — nothing missing, nothing extra.\n- `code-quality-reviewer` -- Code quality review. Assesses code quality, patterns, testing, and maintainability.\n- `implementer` -- Implementation. Executes code changes according to plan tasks with atomic commits.\n- `validator` -- Validation. Runs automated checks and verifies acceptance criteria with evidence.\n\n### git\n\nGit workflow skills -- structured commits, PR creation, and branch management.\n\n**Skills:**\n\n- `/commit` -- Create a well-structured git commit with optional Documentation, Motivation, and Summary sections. Analyzes staged changes, detects Jira ticket IDs from branch names, and builds a formatted commit message.\n- `/pr` -- Create a GitHub pull request from the current branch. Collects commits since divergence from the base branch, detects ticket IDs and URLs from commit messages, and builds a structured PR description.\n- `/branch` -- Create a well-named feature branch from a ticket ID or description. Generates branches with the naming convention `<user>/<slug>-<TICKET-ID>` from the default branch (prefix derived from `git config user.name`).\n- `/worktree` -- Create an isolated git worktree for feature development. Sets up a detached worktree from the default branch in a sibling directory, ready for `/branch` to create a feature branch.\n- `/atcommit` -- Validate and organize changes into self-contained atomic commits. Builds a dependency graph across changed files, detects violations (missing deps, mixed concerns, forward references), and proposes commit groups in the correct order.\n\n### code\n\nCode understanding skills -- PR review with structured feedback and guided code tours.\n\n**Skills:**\n\n- `/review` -- Review a pull request with structured feedback across five categories (Correctness, Security, Design, Testing, Style) with severity levels (critical, suggestion, nit). Presents findings to the user without posting automatically.\n- `/tour` -- Guided code walkthroughs to explain architecture, flows, or structure. Supports three modes: interactive (step-by-step with pauses), written (complete markdown document), and PR comment (collapsible sections posted to a GitHub PR).\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n       git clone https://github.com/rtfpessoa/code-factory.git\n       cd code-factory\n\n2. Run the init script to symlink configuration files:\n\n       ./init.sh\n\n   This creates the following symlinks:\n\n   | Source | Destination |\n   |--------|-------------|\n   | `mcp.json` | `~/.mcp.json` |\n   | `settings.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` |\n   | `opencode.jsonc` | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` |\n\n   If a destination already exists as a regular file (not a symlink), the script warns and skips it. If it exists as a symlink, it is replaced.\n\n3. The marketplace is registered in `settings.json` under `extraKnownMarketplaces` as `code-factory` pointing to `rtfpessoa/code-factory` on GitHub. The plugins `productivity@code-factory`, `git@code-factory`, and `code@code-factory` are enabled by default.\n\n## Configuration Files\n\n### settings.json (Claude Code)\n\nGlobal settings for Claude Code. Defines tool permissions (which bash commands and tools are auto-allowed), the default model (`opus` -- a Claude Code shorthand for the current Opus model), enabled MCP servers, marketplace references, and enabled plugins.\n\n### opencode.jsonc (OpenCode)\n\nConfiguration for the OpenCode CLI. Defines model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), agent profiles for A/B testing different models, MCP server connections, and a granular permission system. Uses JSONC (JSON with comments).\n\n### mcp.json (MCP Servers)\n\nDeclares three MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:\n\n- **atlassian** -- Connects to Atlassian's hosted MCP service for Jira and Confluence integration.\n- **datadog** -- Connects to Datadog's MCP service for observability tooling (disabled by default in local settings).\n- **chrome-devtools** -- Launches a local Chrome DevTools MCP server via npx for browser debugging.\n"
