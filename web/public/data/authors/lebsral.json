coding agent)\n\nInstall all 30 skills in one command. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, and [35+ other agents](https://agentskills.io).\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add lebsral/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills\n```\n\nThe CLI will prompt you to pick which skills and which agents to install. Or install everything non-interactively:\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add lebsral/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills --all -y\n```\n\nTo install globally (available in all your projects):\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add lebsral/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills -g\n```\n\n### Option 2: Claude Code plugin marketplace\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/plugin marketplace add lebsral/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills\n```\n\nThen install a skill group:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install dspy-build-skills@dspy-skills     # Building AI features (15 skills)\n/plugin install dspy-quality-skills@dspy-skills    # Quality and reliability (8 skills)\n/plugin install dspy-ops-skills@dspy-skills        # Production operations (7 skills)\n```\n\n### Option 3: Manual (git clone)\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/lebsral/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills.git\n```\n\nCopy skills to your agent's skill directory:\n\n```bash\n# Claude Code\ncp -r DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/\n\n# Cursor\ncp -r DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/\n```\n\nOr symlink to stay in sync with updates:\n\n```bash\nln -s \"$(pwd)/DSPy-Programming-not-prompting-LMs-skills/skills/\"* ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n### Managing skills\n\n```bash\nnpx skills list          # See what you have installed\nnpx skills check         # Check for updates\nnpx skills update        # Update all installed skills\nnpx skills remove        # Uninstall skills\n```\n\n## Use a skill\n\nIn Claude Code (or any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard):\n\n- **Invoke directly:** `/ai-sorting` or `/ai-kickoff my-project`\n- **Ask naturally:** \"Help me sort support tickets into categories\" — the agent picks the right skill\n\n## How It Works\n\nEach skill is a directory under `skills/` containing:\n\n- **`SKILL.md`** — Main instructions Claude follows (YAML frontmatter + markdown)\n- **`examples.md`** — Worked examples (loaded on demand)\n- **`reference.md`** — Detailed reference material (loaded on demand)\n\nUnder the hood, skills use [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) — a framework for building AI features with composable modules that compile into optimized prompts. You don't need to know DSPy to use these skills; they guide you through everything.\n\nSkills follow the [Claude Code skills format](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.\n\n## Reference Docs\n\n- [`docs/dspy-reference.md`](docs/dspy-reference.md) — DSPy API quick reference (modules, optimizers, patterns)\n- [`docs/langchain-langgraph-reference.md`](docs/langchain-langgraph-reference.md) — LangChain & LangGraph API quick reference (loaders, tools, StateGraph)\n- [`docs/skills-spec.md`](docs/skills-spec.md) — Claude Code skills specification (for contributors)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Adding a new skill\n\n1. Create `skills/ai-<problem>/SKILL.md` — name it after the problem, not the DSPy concept\n2. Add YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` (include phrases users would naturally say)\n3. Write step-by-step instructions in the markdown body\n4. Add `examples.md` and/or `reference.md` for supporting content\n5. Update the problem catalog table in this README\n6. Test with `/ai-<problem>` in Claude Code\n\nSee [`docs/skills-spec.md`](docs/skills-spec.md) for the full skill format specification.\n\n## Links\n\n- [DSPy Documentation](https://dspy.ai/)\n- [DSPy GitHub](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)\n- [Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)\n- [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io)\n"
