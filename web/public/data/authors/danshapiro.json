        "README.md": "# Fresh Eyes\n\nIndependent code review using a different AI model behind the curtain.\n\n## Why?\n\nUsing the same model to review its own work has blind spots. Fresh Eyes sends your code to a completely independent model with zero context from your conversation — only the repo and the scope you give it. Model diversity improves correctness, so by default the skill picks a different model family from the one invoking it.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou need at least one of the following CLIs installed:\n\n**Codex CLI** (for GPT provider):\n```bash\nnpm install -g @openai/codex\n```\n\n**Claude Code CLI** (for Claude provider):\n```bash\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n```\n\nRun `codex` or `claude` to ensure the one you chose is properly set up.\n\n## Manual Mode\n\nIn Claude Code, run:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add danshapiro/fresheyes\n/plugin install fresheyes@danshapiro-fresheyes\n```\n\n**Important:** The reviewer only sees committed code. Commit your changes before invoking.\n\nIn Claude Code:\n\n- `Review this with fresh eyes` - Review staged changes (or last commit if nothing staged)\n- `Review commit abc1234 with fresh eyes` - Review a specific commit\n- `Review the files in src/auth/ with fresh eyes` - Review specific files\n- `Do a security review of src/auth/ with fresh eyes` - Scoped review (user intent passed through faithfully)\n- `Review with fresh eyes using claude` - Use Claude as the reviewer\n- `Review with fresh eyes using gpt` - Use GPT as the reviewer\n\nBy default, the skill picks a different model family from the one invoking it. The reviewer operates independently — it receives only the scope you give it, with no conversation context.\n\n## Automatic Mode (pre-commit)\n\n1. Install the plugin (same as above).\n2. Run the installer from your repo root (using the plugin path):\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/repo\nbash ~/.claude/plugins/fresheyes/scripts/install-automatic-hook.sh\n```\n\nIf your plugin directory is versioned, use that path instead:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/repo\nbash ~/.claude/plugins/fresheyes@danshapiro-fresheyes/scripts/install-automatic-hook.sh\n```\n\nOptional overrides:\n- `SKIP_FRESHEYES=1 git commit` to bypass.\n- `FRESHEYES_SCOPE=\"Review the staged changes using git diff --cached.\"` to customize the scope.\n- `FRESHEYES_ROOT=/path/to/plugin` if the hook cannot find the plugin.\n\nAutomatic mode uses medium reasoning effort and blocks the commit on blocking issues.\n\n## Configuration\n\n| Environment Variable | Description | Default |\n|---|---|---|\n| `FRESHEYES_PROVIDER` | Which provider to use (`gpt` or `claude`) | `gpt` |\n| `FRESHEYES_MODEL` | Override the model name | `gpt-5.3-codex` (gpt) / `opus` (claude) |\n| `FRESHEYES_MODE` | Review mode (`manual` or `automatic`) | `manual` |\n| `SKIP_FRESHEYES` | Set to `1` to bypass pre-commit hook | unset |\n| `FRESHEYES_SCOPE` | Custom scope for pre-commit hook | unset |\n| `FRESHEYES_ROOT` | Override plugin root path | auto-detected |\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
