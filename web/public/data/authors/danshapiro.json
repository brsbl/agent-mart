Fresh Eyes sends your code to a completely independent model with no context of your conversation.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n**Codex CLI** - Install the OpenAI Codex CLI:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @openai/codex\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add danshapiro/fresheyes\n/plugin install fresheyes@danshapiro-fresheyes\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn Claude Code:\n\n- `/fresheyes` - Review staged changes (or last commit if nothing staged)\n- `/fresheyes Review commit abc1234` - Review a specific commit\n- `/fresheyes Review the files in src/auth/` - Review specific files\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

        "README.md": "# Please Hold\n\nLong waits and delayed execution for Claude Code.\n\n## Why?\n\nClaude Code's Bash tool has a 10-minute (600,000ms) maximum timeout. This skill teaches how to wait for hours or indefinitely by chaining background sleeps with task notifications.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- \"Wait until the checkin that fixes the widgets hits main, then rebase onto it, merge, and deploy\"\n- \"Implement the spec after my tokens reset at 1am\"\n- \"Run the live tests when the new version arrives on staging\"\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add danshapiro/please-hold\n/plugin install please-hold@danshapiro-please-hold\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe skill is automatically invoked when you ask Claude to wait longer than 10 minutes or do something after a condition becomes true.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Wait until the checkin that fixes the widgets hits main, then rebase onto it, merge, and deploy\"\n- \"Implement the spec after my tokens reset at 1am\"\n- \"Run the live tests when the new version arrives on staging\"\n\n## How It Works\n\nBackground tasks create an event-driven loop:\n\n```\nsleep (background) → <task-notification> → sleep (background) → ... → execute\n```\n\nEach 10-minute sleep runs with `run_in_background: true`, returning immediately. When complete, Claude receives a `<task-notification>` and starts the next interval. Progress is tracked via TodoWrite.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
