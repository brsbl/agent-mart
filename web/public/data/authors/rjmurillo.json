It provides specialized AI agents that handle different phases of the development lifecycle, from research and planning through implementation and quality assurance.\n\nThe orchestrator is the hub of operations. Within it has logic from taking everything from a \"vibe\" or a \"shower thought\" and building out a fully functional spec with acceptance criteria and user stories, to taking a well defined idea as input and executing on it. There are 17 agents that cover the roles of software development, from vision and strategy, to architecture, implementation, and verification. Each role looks at something specific, like the critic that just looks to poke holes in other agents' (or your own) work, or DevOps that's concerned about how you deploy and operate the thing you just built.\n\nThe agents themselves use the platform specific handoffs to invoke subagents, keeping the orchestrator context clean. A great example of this is orchestrator facilitating creating and debating an [Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) from research and drafting, to discussion, iterating on the issues, tie breaking when agents don't agree. And then  extracting persistent knowledge to steer future agents to adhere. Artifacts are stored in your memory system if you have one enabled, and Markdown files for easy reference to both agents and humans.\n\n### Core Capabilities\n\n- **17 specialized agents** for different development phases (analysis, architecture, implementation, QA, etc.)\n- **Explicit handoff protocols** between agents with clear accountability\n- **Multi-Agent Impact Analysis Framework** for comprehensive planning\n- **Cross-session memory** using cloudmcp-manager for persistent context\n- **Self-improvement system** with skill tracking and retrospectives\n- **TUI-based installation** via [skill-installer](https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer)\n- **AI-powered CI/CD** with issue triage, PR quality gates, and spec validation\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n| Platform | Agent Location | Notes |\n|----------|---------------|-------|\n| **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** | `src/vs-code-agents/` | Use `@agent` syntax in Copilot Chat |\n| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `src/copilot-cli/` | Use `--agent` flag |\n| **Claude Code CLI** | `src/claude/` | Use `Task(subagent_type=\"...\")` |\n\n### Install via skill-installer\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10+\n- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager\n\nInstall UV:\n\nmacOS/Linux\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nWindows (PowerShell)\n\n```powershell\npwsh -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\nUse [skill-installer](https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer) to install agents:\n\nWithout installing (one-liner)\n\n```bash\n# Latest version\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer skill-installer interactive\n\n# Specific version (e.g., v0.2.0)\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer@v0.2.0 skill-installer interactive\n```\n\nOr install globally for repeated use\n\n```bash\n# Latest version\nuv tool install git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer\n\n# Specific version (e.g., v0.1.0 or v0.2.0)\nuv tool install git+https://github.com/rjmurillo/skill-installer@v0.1.0\n\n# Run the interactive installer\nskill-installer interactive\n```\n\nNavigate the TUI to select and install agents for your platform.\n\nSee [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for complete installation documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAfter installing the agents with the method of your choice, you can either select one of them explicitly, ask your LLM to use the agent by name, or even prefix your input with the name of the agent.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Multi-Step Coordination Pattern\n\n> orchestrator: merge your branch with main, then find other items that are in non-compliance with @path/to/historical-reference-protocol.md and create a plan to correct each. Store the plan in @path/to/plans/historical-reference-protocol-remediation.md and validate with critic, correcting all identified issues. After the plan is completed, start implementor to execute the plan and use critic, qa, and security to review the results, correcting all critical and major issues recursively. After the work is completed and verified, open a PR.\n\nThis demonstrates the orchestrator's strengths in chaining operations together and routing between agents.\n\n#### Recursive Fix Loop Pattern\n\n> orchestrator: fix all items identified by the critic agent, then repeat the cycle recursively until no items are found.\n\nThis can be really helpful to keep the AI agent \"honest\" with their work. Agents will try to be _helpful_ by declaring they're done sooner, skipping steps to speed up the process, or not reading all the documentation to be \"efficient\". Having another agent with the sole purpose of validating the work product of another makes the system stronger. A typical flow might be:\n\n1. Do work\n2. Validate that work against a spec (issue or ticket, plan, design, test, documentation, etc.)\n3. Send to another agent (QA)\n4. repeat on down the line\n\nYou can start to chain different workflows together as subagents to keep the orchestration context alive longer. If you develop software, you probably have some form of \"write code -> make it work -> refactor\" cycle. Orchestrator is great at that. Invoke it from a skill, slash command, or prompt to facilitate.\n\n#### Implementation with Validation Gate\n\n> orchestrator: implement Task E2 session validation and E4 pre-commit memory evidence checks. Run the QA agent to verify the implementation meets the PRD acceptance criteria.\n\n#### PR Coordination Workflow\n\n> orchestrator: review the PR comments, address each reviewer's feedback, then run the code-reviewer agent to verify fixes before requesting re-review\n\n---\n\n## System Architecture\n\n### Agent Catalog\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| **orchestrator** | Task coordination and routing |\n| **analyst** | Pre-implementation research |\n| **architect** | Design governance and ADRs |\n| **planner** | Milestones and work packages |\n| **implementer** | Production code and tests |\n| **critic** | Plan validation |\n| **qa** | Test strategy and verification |\n| **security** | Vulnerability assessment |\n| **devops** | CI/CD pipelines |\n| **retrospective** | Learning extraction |\n| **memory** | Cross-session context |\n| **skillbook** | Skill management |\n| **explainer** | PRDs and documentation |\n| **task-generator** | Atomic task breakdown |\n| **high-level-advisor** | Strategic decisions |\n| **independent-thinker** | Challenge assumptions |\n| **pr-comment-responder** | PR review handling |\n\nSee [USING-AGENTS.md](USING-AGENTS.md) for detailed agent documentation.\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```text\nai-agents/\n├── src/\n│   ├── vs-code-agents/      # VS Code / GitHub Copilot agents\n│   ├── copilot-cli/         # GitHub Copilot CLI agents\n│   └── claude/              # Claude Code CLI agents\n├── templates/               # Agent template system\n├── scripts/                 # Validation and utility scripts\n├── docs/                    # Documentation\n├── .agents/                 # Agent artifacts (ADRs, plans, etc.)\n├── .claude-plugin/          # skill-installer manifest\n├── copilot-instructions.md  # GitHub Copilot instructions\n├── CLAUDE.md                # Claude Code instructions\n└── USING-AGENTS.md          # Detailed usage guide\n```\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.\n\n1.
