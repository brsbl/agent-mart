        "README.md": "# PE Executive Plugin\n\nA decision-making model for understanding how private equity portfolio company executives think. This plugin is not a comprehensive PE operations manual — it focuses on the mental models, incentive structures, and behavioral patterns that drive executive decisions, so non-executives can understand, anticipate, and work effectively within PE-owned companies.\n\n## What This Plugin Does\n\n- **Brainstorm** deliverables and opportunities through a PE executive's decision framework\n- **Review** work products the way a PE board member would evaluate them\n- **Explain** PE executive behavior and decisions in plain language for non-executives\n\n## What This Plugin Is Not\n\nThis is not an operational playbook for running a PE portfolio company. It does not cover technology strategy, sector-specific models, procurement frameworks, ESG compliance, or market dynamics. It covers how PE executives reason — what they prioritize, what they ignore, and why — grounded in the incentive structures, governance systems, and cultural forces that shape their thinking.\n\n## Components\n\n### Skill: pe-executive-mindset\n\nCore mental model covering the four interlocking pressures that drive PE executive behavior: the exit clock, equity incentives, leverage constraints, and the replacement threat.\n\nReference material in five areas:\n\n- **Incentive structures** — Compensation mechanics, equity design, hurdle rates, case studies (Petco, SolarWinds, Toys R Us)\n- **Governance and monitoring** — Board dynamics, reporting cadence, VCP structure, KPI cascades, adjusted EBITDA and quality of earnings\n- **Decision patterns** — Exit clock, leverage effects, buy-and-build, deal-type variation (buyout, growth, distressed, carve-out), motivation dynamics across the deal lifecycle\n- **Demographics and culture** — Selection patterns, network effects, cultural norms, shareholder primacy origins, psychological selection effects, key academic works\n- **Psychological experience** — Coping patterns, moral injury, moral disengagement, cognitive dissonance, emotional labor, ethical fading, practical resources\n\n### Commands\n\n- `/pe-brainstorm [topic or file]` — Generate deliverables and opportunities from a PE executive perspective. Accepts a topic, a file path for company-specific context, or both.\n\n- `/pe-review [file]` — Review a deliverable through a PE executive's lens. Evaluates strategic alignment, metrics, timeline, and rigor. Provides a direct board-readiness assessment.\n\n- `/pe-explain [decision or concept]` — Explain PE executive decisions and concepts in plain language for non-executives. Connects behavior to structural forces and provides actionable implications.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n- **skills/** — The core knowledge base (SKILL.md and reference files)\n- **commands/** — The three slash commands\n- **docs/** — Archive of the source research that informed the plugin. These files are not loaded by the plugin at runtime; they are preserved here for provenance and future reference.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Claude Code\n\nAdd the marketplace and install:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add michaelmilton/pe-exec-plugin\n/plugin install pe-executive@pe-plugins\n```\n\nOr load directly for a single session:\n\n```\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/this/repo\n```\n\nOnce installed, the skill loads automatically when relevant topics come up, and the three commands (`/pe-brainstorm`, `/pe-review`, `/pe-explain`) are available.\n\n### Cowork\n\nInstall the `.plugin` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/michaelmilton/pe-exec-plugin/releases) through the Cowork plugin manager. The commands and skill will appear in your session automatically.\n\n### Plain Claude (claude.ai) or ChatGPT\n\nThese platforms don't support plugins directly. Use the single-file deployment artifact instead:\n\n1. Create a new Project (Claude) or GPT (ChatGPT)\n2. Upload `pe-executive-guide.md` as project knowledge or custom instructions\n\nThat's it. The guide combines the full skill body, all five reference files, and usage instructions into one document.\n\nThe commands won't work as `/slash-commands` on these platforms, but you can achieve the same results by asking directly (e.g., \"Brainstorm a 100-day plan for a SaaS acquisition from a PE executive perspective\").\n\n## Examples\n\n- `/pe-brainstorm 100-day plan for a SaaS acquisition`\n- `/pe-review @board-deck.md`\n- `/pe-explain Why is our new CEO replacing the entire leadership team?`\n- \"How would a PE executive prioritize these three initiatives?\"\n- \"What would a PE board want to see in this quarterly update?\"\n"
