        "README.md": "# SupremePower Active Engine (Phase 3)\n\n> **The engine that drives your AI coding assistants.**\n\nThis branch implements the **Active Workflow Engine**, a shared state system that synchronizes your development context across:\n*   **VS Code** (Visual Sidebar, Chat)\n*   **Terminal** (CLI commands)\n*   **GitHub Copilot** (Dynamic Instructions)\n\n## Why?\n\nPassive markdown instructions are okay, but they don't know *when* you are done with a task. The Active Engine tracks your state (e.g., \"TDD: Red Phase\") and **force-feeds** the exact right instructions to Copilot at the right time.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1.  **Shared State Core:** A JSON-based source of truth (`~/.supremepower/state.json`) that all tools read/write.\n2.  **Context Bridge:** Automatically generates `.github/supremepower-active.md` to tell Copilot exactly what to do next.\n3.  **VS Code Extension:** A visual sidebar showing your progress through a skill (e.g., TDD steps).\n4.  **CLI Automation:** Run `sp next` to advance the workflow from the terminal.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n> **Detailed Guide:** [VS Code Extension Documentation](docs/vscode-extension.md)\n\n1.  **Install the Extension:**\n    ```bash\n    cd vscode-extension\n    npm install\n    npm run compile\n    # Open in VS Code (F5)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Start a Skill:**\n    *   VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` -> `SP: Start Skill...` -> `tdd`\n    *   CLI: `/supremepower:tdd` (if integrated)\n\n3.  **Code with Copilot:**\n    *   Copilot now knows you are in the \"Red Phase\" and will help you write a failing test.\n\n4.  **Advance:**\n    *   VS Code: Click \"Next Step\"\n    *   CLI: Run `sp next`\n    *   Copilot now knows you are in \"Green Phase\" and helps you pass the test."
