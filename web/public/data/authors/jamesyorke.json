        "README.md": "# Worktree Agent Skill\n\nGit worktree management for any AI coding tool that supports the [Agent Skills open format](https://agentskills.io/home) — create, list, remove, and prune worktrees with flexible placement strategies.\n\n## Who this is for\n\n- Developers who work on multiple branches simultaneously and want a consistent worktree workflow\n- Teams who want their AI agent to handle worktree operations with safe defaults (force removal, auto-prune, .gitignore management)\n- Anyone tired of remembering the `git worktree` command syntax\n\n## How to Use This Skill\n\n### Option A: Using skills.sh (recommended)\n\nInstall this skill with a single command:\n```bash\nnpx skills add https://github.com/jamesyorke/worktree-agent-skill --skill worktree-manager\n```\n\nThen use the skill in your AI agent, for example:\n> Use the worktree skill to create a new worktree for feature/auth off develop\n\n### Option B: Claude Code Plugin\n\n#### Personal Usage\n\nTo install this Skill for your personal use in Claude Code:\n\n1. Add the marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add jamesyorke/worktree-agent-skill\n   ```\n\n2. Install the Skill:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin install worktree-manager@worktree-agent-skill\n   ```\n\n#### Project Configuration\n\nTo automatically provide this Skill to everyone working in a repository, configure the repository's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"worktree-manager@worktree-agent-skill\": true\n  },\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": {\n    \"worktree-agent-skill\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"source\": \"github\",\n        \"repo\": \"jamesyorke/worktree-agent-skill\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option C: Manual install\n\n1. **Clone** this repository.\n2. **Install or symlink** the `worktree-manager/` folder following your tool's official skills installation docs.\n3. **Use your AI tool** as usual and ask it to use the \"worktree-manager\" skill.\n\n## What This Skill Offers\n\n### Create Worktrees\n- Create a new branch and worktree in one step\n- Check out an existing branch into a new worktree\n- Choose between subfolder (`.worktrees/`) or sibling directory placement\n- Automatic `.gitignore` management for subfolder worktrees\n\n### List Worktrees\n- View all worktrees with their paths, commits, and branches\n- Porcelain output for scripting\n\n### Remove Worktrees\n- Safe removal with `--force` (handles submodules automatically)\n- Automatic pruning of stale references after removal\n- Cleanup of empty `.worktrees/` directories\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- Submodule removal errors\n- Branch already checked out conflicts\n- Stale worktree references\n- `.gitignore` issues\n\n## Skill Structure\n\n```\nworktree-manager/\n├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill file with routing and agent contract\n└── references/\n    ├── _index.md               # Navigation index\n    ├── creating.md             # Creating worktrees (new branch or existing)\n    ├── listing.md              # Listing and inspecting worktrees\n    ├── placement.md            # Subfolder vs parent folder strategies\n    ├── removing.md             # Removing, pruning, cleanup\n    └── troubleshooting.md      # Common errors and fixes\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis skill is open-source and available under the MIT License.
