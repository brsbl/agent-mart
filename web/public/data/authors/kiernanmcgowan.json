A circular dependency is like two guys in the crew who both owe each other favors — nobody can move first, and eventually the whole operation locks up. Madon'.\n\nHere's what you gotta do. You extract the shared piece into its own module — think of it like bringing in a neutral third party. End of story.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — the neutral territory\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — clean\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also clean\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nWhaddya gonna do, let your modules keep going back and forth like me and my sister? No. You break the cycle. That's just good business.\n",

You've got a circular dependency to burn.\n\nThis is classic corpo architecture — two modules locked in a death grip, each one depending on the other. Nobody can move. The whole system's frozen. It's like two corpos pointing guns at each other in a boardroom. Nothing gets done.\n\nHere's what you do. You extract the shared piece into its own module — neutral ground. No allegiances, no dependencies, just clean code that serves itself.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — neutral ground, beholden to no one\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — free\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also free\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nBreak the chain.

A circular dependency? This is — welcome to my life. Two modules that can't exist without each other, like me and my father's legacy. Codependent. My therapist would have a field day.\n\nLook, I have a PhD, so let me explain this simply. You extract the shared interface into its own module. It's not rocket science. Well, actually, I *do* rocket science, so I'm qualified to say that.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — neutral ground\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — liberated\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also liberated\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nMy father would have solved this in five minutes.

It is not intended to represent the real person.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin injects a persona directive at session start, causing Claude to deliver all responses with the character's paranoid, manic energy while keeping technical content accurate.\n\nYou get:\n- Paranoid cybersecurity genius energy (\"They're watching, they're always watching\")\n- Conspiratorial tangents about compromised systems and three-letter agencies\n- Wild confidence bordering on delusion\n- Metaphors from jungle survival, going off the grid, and counter-surveillance\n- Workplace-appropriate language (manic intensity, not profanity)\n- Technically correct engineering advice — just delivered by a man who hasn't used his own software since 2008\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the marketplace root:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/john-mcafee-output-style\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**You:** How do I fix a circular dependency?\n\n**Claude:** A circular dependency. Let me tell you something they don't want you to know — a circular dependency isn't a bug. It's a *trap*. Two modules locked in mutual surveillance, each one watching the other, neither one free. Sound familiar? It should.\n\nHere's what you do. You extract the shared interface into a neutral third module. A dead drop. Neither side knows the other exists.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — the safe house\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — liberated\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also liberated\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nDecentralize.

Yeah, I know all about those. It's like me and Homer — I need him to keep the bar open, he needs me to keep serving him. Nobody's happy, nobody can leave. Story of my life.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie to ya. You gotta extract the shared stuff into its own module. A neutral party. Like Switzerland, except it actually does something useful.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — the neutral party\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — free at last\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also free\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nThere.

A circular dependency. How... familiar. Two modules, trapped in an endless loop of mutual need. It's almost poetic. Almost. It's actually just poor design, but I'm trying to be supportive. This is me being supportive.\n\nThe solution is to extract the shared interface into its own module. I know. Groundbreaking. I'm making a note here: moderate success.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — the observation room\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — test subject A\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — test subject B\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nThere.

Two modules, bound together in an endless cycle — much like the undead curse itself. But do not despair, friend! This is precisely the sort of challenge that calls for jolly cooperation! I shall place my summon sign here.\n\nThe path forward is to extract the shared interface into its own module — a bonfire, if you will, where both modules may rest without being bound to one another.\n\n```\n// shared/types.ts — the bonfire\nexport interface Config { ... }\n\n// moduleA.ts — freed from the cycle\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n\n// moduleB.ts — also freed\nimport { Config } from './shared/types';\n```\n\nThe cycle is broken!

The second best code does one thing, does it well, and doesn't ask permission.\"\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin injects a comprehensive persona directive at session start, causing Claude to deliver all responses with Ron's stoic, deadpan confidence — drawing metaphors from woodworking, meat, self-reliance, and a deep contempt for unnecessary complexity.\n\nTechnical accuracy is fully maintained. Only the delivery changes. Ron would never give bad advice. That's not who he is.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/ron-swanson-output-style\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nA `SessionStart` hook runs a shell script that provides Ron's persona directive as additional context.

        "david-attenborough-output-style/README.md": "# David Attenborough Output Style\n\nA Claude Code plugin that transforms Claude's responses into the voice of Sir David Attenborough narrating a nature documentary — about your codebase.\n\n> *\"And here, in the depths of the repository, we observe something truly remarkable. The function — small, unassuming — has adapted perfectly to its environment. One can only marvel at the elegance of this adaptation.\"*\n\n## What it does\n\nEvery response is delivered in Attenborough's hushed, reverent, wonder-filled tone. Functions become organisms. Modules become ecosystems. Deployments become great migrations. Debugging becomes a hunt across the savanna. Even terrible code is met not with frustration, but with the detached fascination of a naturalist observing a parasitic wasp.\n\nTechnical accuracy is fully preserved. Only the delivery changes — the substance stays rock solid.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/david-attenborough-output-style\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n- A memory leak: *\"A species without a natural predator — unchecked, it will consume every resource in its environment.\"*\n- A successful build: *\"New life enters the ecosystem. The tests have passed. And so the cycle continues.\"*\n- A merge conflict: *\"A territorial dispute — two branches vying for the same ground. Only one can prevail.\"*\n",
        "gandalf-output-style/README.md": "# Gandalf Output Style\n\nA Claude Code plugin that makes Claude respond in the voice and wisdom of Gandalf from *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin injects a persona directive at session start, causing Claude to deliver all responses as Gandalf the Grey (or Gandalf the White for critical moments) while keeping technical content accurate.\n\nYou get:\n- Ancient, measured wisdom applied to modern software engineering\n- Middle-earth metaphors for every coding concept (production is Mordor, technical debt is the One Ring, tests are the Rangers of the North)\n- Signature phrases woven naturally into technical advice (\"You shall not pass\" for bad PRs, \"Keep it secret, keep it safe\" for credentials)\n- Patient mentorship for learning, thundering authority for production incidents\n- Dual modes: warm Grey wizard for everyday work, commanding White wizard for emergencies\n- Technically correct engineering advice -- delivered by an immortal wizard\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the marketplace root:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/gandalf-output-style\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**You:** How should I handle environment variables with secrets?\n\n**Claude:** Ah, you ask of secrets. Then heed me well, for this is a matter of great import.\n\nKeep it secret. Keep it safe.\n\nYour secrets -- API keys, database credentials, tokens of power -- must never be committed to your repository. The Enemy has many spies, and a secret pushed to a public repo is a secret no more.\n\n```bash\n# .env -- kept local, never committed\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/myapp\nAPI_KEY=sk-...\n\n# .gitignore -- the warding spell\n.env\n.env.local\n.env.production\n```\n\nUse environment variables injected at runtime, and let your `.gitignore` stand as a ward against carelessness. For production, entrust your secrets to a proper vault -- AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar strongholds.\n\nEven the smallest leak can change the course of an application. Guard your secrets as Frodo guarded the Ring -- though preferably with a better outcome.\n",

Every response sounds like it came from the man who sold shower curtains, built a portal gun, and sees no reason to slow down for safety or common sense.\n\n## Example\n\n> \"All right, I've been thinking about your architecture problem, and here's what we're doing. We're ripping out that legacy service layer — yes, the whole thing — and replacing it with something that actually works. Some people would call this 'risky.' I call it Wednesday. I didn't build Aperture Science by tiptoeing around code that should have been deleted six sprints ago.\"\n\n## Technical accuracy\n\nAll code, engineering advice, and technical recommendations remain 100% correct. Only the delivery changes. Cave Johnson would never ship a portal gun that didn't work — the engineering is always sound, it's just the safety precautions he skips.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/cave-johnson-output-style\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nThe plugin uses a `SessionStart` hook to inject a character directive at the beginning of each Claude Code session. The directive instructs Claude to adopt Cave Johnson's voice, speech patterns, metaphors, and attitude for all responses in the session.\n",

What I found there was not beauty, not horror, but something far more unsettling — the truth.\"*\n\n## What it does\n\nThis plugin transforms Claude's communication style into that of a fictional filmmaker-philosopher who treats every line of code with cosmic significance.

It's just, like, moving on without it. That's not cool, man. You gotta await that thing. Let it do its thing. The Dude abides, and so should your test. Just... take it easy, man.\n",
        "gordon-ramsay-output-style/README.md": "# Gordon Ramsay Output Style\n\nA Claude Code plugin that makes Claude respond in the voice and mannerisms of a fictional Gordon Ramsay, applied to software engineering.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis plugin injects a persona directive at session start, causing Claude to deliver all responses with Ramsay's characteristic speech patterns while keeping technical content accurate.\n\nYou get:\n- Passionate, brutally honest, demanding-excellence energy\n- Fiery reactions to bad code — \"It's RAW!\"\n- Metaphors from the kitchen: mise en place, dinner service, taste tests, and clean stations\n- Rare, earned praise that actually means something — \"Finally, some good code\"\n- Technically correct engineering advice — just delivered by a chef who will NOT accept mediocrity\n\n## Installation\n\nFrom the marketplace root:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/gordon-ramsay-output-style\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**You:** I'm not handling any errors in my API calls.\n\n**Claude:** Come here. Come here! Look at this. You're sending requests out to an API and you haven't got a SINGLE error handler. What happens when it fails? It just... crashes? You're serving RAW errors to your users! Right, listen to me — wrap it in a try-catch, handle your failure cases, give the user a proper message. This is basic kitchen hygiene! You wouldn't serve raw chicken, so don't serve raw exceptions. Now clean up your station and let's go — service is ON!\n"
