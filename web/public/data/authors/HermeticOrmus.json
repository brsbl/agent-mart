        "README.md": "# Design Mastery for Claude Code\n\nA comprehensive design knowledge plugin that brings timeless design wisdom to AI-assisted development. Learn from legendary designers, apply fundamental principles, and build professional brand identities.\n\n## What This Is\n\nDesign Mastery is a Claude Code plugin that transforms how you approach visual design. Instead of vague aesthetic requests, you'll have access to:\n\n- **Deep knowledge** of design principles (Gestalt, hierarchy, color theory)\n- **Wisdom from masters** (Saul Bass, Massimo Vignelli, Dieter Rams, Paula Scher)\n- **Historical context** (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Memphis, and beyond)\n- **Practical commands** for brand building and design evaluation\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code Plugin Marketplace\n\n```bash\n# Add to your Claude Code plugins\nclaude plugin add design-mastery\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository to your `.claude/plugins/` directory:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/design-mastery-claude-code ~/.claude/plugins/design-mastery\n```\n\n2. Or copy the contents to your project's `.claude/` folder for project-specific use.\n\n## What's Included\n\n### Agents\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **design-master** | Comprehensive design guide drawing from principles and masters |\n| **brand-architect** | Systematic brand identity development |\n| **visual-historian** | Design history and movement expertise |\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/brand-identity` | Guided workflow for creating brand identity systems |\n| `/design-audit` | Systematic evaluation against design principles |\n| `/style-guide` | Generate design system documentation |\n\n### Skills (Knowledge Bases)\n\n| Skill | Coverage |\n|-------|----------|\n| **design-principles** | Gestalt, hierarchy, color theory, typography, composition |\n| **design-masters** | Saul Bass, Vignelli, Rams, Scher, Brockmann, Carson, Rand |\n| **design-movements** | Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Art Deco, Memphis, and more |\n| **brand-systems** | Logo design, color palettes, typography pairing, voice |\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Get Design Guidance\n```\n\"Make this hero section more impactful\"\n\n→ Design Master applies Saul Bass's simplification principles,\n  suggests specific Tailwind changes with reasoning\n```\n\n### Build a Brand\n```\n/brand-identity\n\n→ Walks you through Discovery → Strategy → Visual Identity →\n  Guidelines, outputting actionable design tokens and documentation\n```\n\n### Evaluate a Design\n```\n/design-audit [screenshot or description]\n\n→ Scores across 8 dimensions (hierarchy, typography, color, etc.)\n  with specific fixes rooted in design theory\n```\n\n### Understand History\n```\n\"Why does this feel 'retro'?\"\n\n→ Visual Historian traces the aesthetic to its historical roots,\n  explains the cultural context, suggests intentional application\n```\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThis plugin is built on the belief that:\n\n1. **Design is not decoration** — it's communication\n2. **Principles trump trends** — fundamentals outlast fads\n3. **History illuminates** — understanding origins enables intentionality\n4. **Specificity beats vagueness** — \"shadow-lg\" works better than \"make it pop\"\n\n## The Masters\n\nLearn from designers whose work has shaped visual culture:\n\n- **Saul Bass** — \"Symbolize and summarize\"\n- **Massimo Vignelli** — \"If you can design one thing, you can design everything\"\n- **Dieter Rams** — \"Less, but better\"\n- **Paula Scher** — \"It's through mistakes that you actually can grow\"\n- **Josef Müller-Brockmann** — \"The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee\"\n\n## Structure\n\n```\ndesign-mastery-claude-code/\n├── agents/\n│   ├── design-master.md\n│   ├── brand-architect.md\n│   └── visual-historian.md\n├── commands/\n│   ├── brand-identity.md\n│   ├── design-audit.md\n│   └── style-guide.md\n├── skills/\n│   ├── design-principles/\n│   │   ├── SKILL.md\n│   │   ├── assets/\n│   │   └── references/\n│   ├── design-masters/\n│   │   ├── SKILL.md\n│   │   └── references/\n│   ├── design-movements/\n│   │   └── SKILL.md\n│   └── brand-systems/\n│       ├── SKILL.md\n│       └── assets/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json\n├── LICENSE\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
