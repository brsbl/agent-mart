Download the zip archive from [deckrd - release](https://github.com/aglabo/deckrd/releases)\n2. Copy the `deckrd` directory to your Agent Skills directory\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Workflow\n\n```\nGoals / Ideas\n    ↓\nrequirements (Define requirements)\n    ↓\nspecifications (Write specifications)\n    ↓\nimplementation (Decision criteria)\n    ↓\ntasks (Implementation tasks)\n    ↓\nCode / Tests\n```\n\n### Key Commands\n\n| Command                     | Description                        |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| `init <namespace>/<module>` | Prepare directories for documents  |\n| `req`                       | Create requirements definition     |\n| `spec`                      | Create specification document      |\n| `impl`                      | Create implementation criteria     |\n| `tasks`                     | Create implementation task list    |\n| `dr --add`                  | Record Decision Records (optional) |\n| `status`                    | Check workflow progress            |\n\n> For details, see the plugin README:\n>\n> - [deckrd plugin](plugins/deckrd/README.md)\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### About implementation\n\nThe implementation layer is **not a place to write actual code**.\nIt records the following aspects of implementation decisions:\n\n- Rationale for choosing implementation strategies\n- Decision basis when multiple options exist\n- Constraints (compatibility, performance, dependencies, etc.)\n- Items intentionally decided \"not to implement\"\n\n### What deckrd Does NOT Do\n\ndeckrd does not aim to:\n\n- Automatically generate code\n- Enforce implementation details\n- Impose a single development methodology (TDD / BDD, etc.)\n\ndeckrd is purely an **assistive framework for organizing thoughts and decisions**.\n\n---\n\n## deckrd-coder Plugin\n\n### About deckrd-coder\n\n`deckrd-coder` is an **optional plugin** for deckrd users.\nIt takes `tasks.md` generated by deckrd and automatically implements them using a strict BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) process.\n\n**Completely optional**: You can use deckrd alone to generate tasks and implement them manually at your own pace.\n\n### Installation\n\ndeckrd-coder is available from the deckrd marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install deckrd-coder@deckrd\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Plan and document with deckrd\n/deckrd init myProject/feature\n/deckrd req\n/deckrd spec\n/deckrd impl\n/deckrd tasks\n\n# Step 2: Implement automatically with deckrd-coder (optional)\n/deckrd-coder T01-01    # Implement task T01-01\n/deckrd-coder T01-02    # Implement task T01-02\n# ... (run for each task)\n\n# Step 3: Verify and commit\ngit diff\ngit add .\ngit commit\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **Prerequisites**: deckrd's `tasks.md` is required. Run deckrd first.\n- **Implementation Flow**: Automatically executes Red-Green-Refactor cycle (test → implement → refactor)\n- **Quality Gates**: Automatically validates tests, linting, and type checking\n- **Commit**: Execute manually (not automatic)\n\n> For details, see [deckrd-coder plugin](plugins/deckrd-coder/README.md)\n",

It breaks down project ambitions into clear requirements, specifications, and executable tasks through iterative discussion with Claude AI.\n\nRather than jumping directly to implementation, deckrd ensures you capture reasoning at each stage—understanding *why* decisions are made, not just *what* gets built.\n\n## What deckrd does NOT do\n\n- It does not manage source code repositories\n- It does not execute or modify code automatically\n- It does not replace developer judgment\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Stepwise Workflow: Goals → Requirements → Specifications → Implementation → Tasks\n- Document-Centered: Each stage produces a derived document that preserves context and intent\n- AI-Guided: Interactive guidance at each step keeps you focused and aligned\n- State Management: Automatic session tracking ensures workflow consistency\n- Flexible: Works with any project type—features, refactoring, debugging, documentation\n\n## Implementation (in deckrd)\n\nIn deckrd, \"implementation\" does not mean writing production code.\nIt refers to deriving implementation-ready decisions, constraints,\nand structural outlines that make coding straightforward and unambiguous.\n\n## The Output: tasks.md\n\nThe final output of deckrd is **tasks.md**—a document that serves as your **direct starting point for coding**.\n\nUnlike planning documents that capture intent and reasoning, tasks.md is your actionable blueprint:\n\n- Concrete Tasks: Specific, prioritized development tasks derived from your implementation plan\n- Acceptance Criteria: Clear definitions of what \"done\" means for each task\n- Implementation Constraints: Technical decisions and patterns established during earlier phases\n- Ready-to-Code Format: Structured in a way that developers can immediately begin implementation\n\nThis means when you finish the deckrd workflow, you're not just ready to start coding—you have a detailed roadmap that eliminates ambiguity and reduces rework. Each task in tasks.md flows directly into your development cycle.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nThe deckrd plugin is available in the Claude Code Marketplace. Enable it through:\n\n```bash\nClaude Code → Settings → Plugins → Enable deckrd\n```\n\n## First Use\n\nOnce enabled, start a new workflow with:\n\n```bash\n/deckrd init <namespace>/<module>\n```\n\ndeckrd then guides you through a stepwise workflow,\nderiving documents from goals to executable tasks.\n\n## Where documents are stored\n\ndeckrd manages all generated documents and workflow state under `docs/.deckrd/` in your project.\n\nYou can browse the derived requirements, specifications, and tasks at any time using your editor or file explorer.\n\n## Use Cases\n\ndeckrd works well for:\n\n- New Features: Clarify requirements before coding\n- Refactoring: Document the why before restructuring\n- Bug Fixes: Understand root causes and plan solutions\n- System Design: Capture architectural decisions\n- Documentation: Trace decision-making and rationale\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor detailed guides and command reference, see the included skill documentation or visit the deckrd repository.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\nCopyright (C) 2025- aglabo\n",
        "plugins/deckrd-coder/README.md": "---\nname: deckrd-coder\ndescription: BDD厳格プロセスに従ってdeckrdタスクを自動実装するスキル\nmeta:\n  author: atsushifx\n---\n\n<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/sentence-length -->\n<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/no-exclamation-question-mark -->\n<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/max-comma -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length  -->\n\n# deckrd-coder\n\nA Claude Code skill that automatically implements Deckrd tasks using a strict BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) process, with integrated quality gates and project memory optimization.\n\n## What is deckrd-coder?\n\ndeckrd-coder is a **completely optional companion plugin** that automates the implementation of Deckrd-generated tasks using a strict BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) workflow.\n\n**It works like this:**\n\n1. You complete a Deckrd session and generate `tasks.md`\n2. You invoke `/deckrd-coder <TASK_ID>` to implement a task\n3. deckrd-coder automatically runs the entire Red-Green-Refactor cycle for you\n\n**Why it's optional:** Deckrd itself is a complete planning framework that works independently. deckrd-coder is purely a helper for automating implementation. You can use Deckrd alone to generate tasks, then implement them manually at your own pace—or use deckrd-coder to accelerate the process with BDD-style automation.\n\n**What makes it different:** Rather than writing code first, deckrd-coder ensures each task follows TDD principles:\n\n1. **Red**: Write tests that fail\n2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests\n3. **Refactor**: Clean and optimize\n\nThis guarantees high-quality, fully-tested, traceable changes—with every implementation decision captured and justified.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- BDD Strict Process: Red-Green-Refactor cycle for every task ensures quality\n- Automatic Task Extraction: Extracts task definitions from `tasks.md`\n- 8-Step Workflow: Structured implementation pipeline from quality gates to completion\n- Quality Assurance: Automated testing, linting, and type checking at every stage\n- Token Efficiency: Project memory & serena-mcp integration reduces unnecessary processing\n- Internal bdd-coder Agent: Handles Red-Green-Refactor phases automatically\n- Progress Tracking: TodoWrite integration for detailed step management\n- 1 Message = 1 Task: Maintains focus and code quality (no multi-tasking)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\ndeckrd-coder requires an existing Deckrd workflow and a generated `tasks.md`.\n\n- deckrd must be used first to derive tasks\n- deckrd-coder operates exclusively on tasks defined in `tasks.md`\n- Without deckrd and its derived tasks, deckrd-coder has no standalone use\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\ndeckrd-coder is available as an optional plugin for deckrd users.\n\n```bash\nClaude Code → Settings → Plugins → Enable deckrd\n```\n\nThe skill becomes available in your Deckrd sessions.\n\n## First Use\n\nTo implement a task in your Deckrd session:\n\n```bash\n/deckrd-coder T01-02\n```\n\nWhere `T01-02` is your task ID extracted from `tasks.md`.\n\nThe skill automatically:\n\n1. Validates quality gate commands\n2. Extracts the task definition\n3. Creates implementation subtasks\n4. Runs Red-Green-Refactor cycle (via bdd-coder agent)\n5. Executes quality gates\n6. Records progress and completes\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Skill not found error\n\nIf you get an \"Unknown skill: deckrd\" error when trying to use `/deckrd`:\n\n1. **Check marketplace installation**:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/deckrd-tools/\n   ```\n\n2. Verify plugin structure:\n   ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/deckrd-tools/plugins/deckrd/skills/\n\n3. Manual skill discovery:\n   If the Skill tool doesn't recognize deckrd, search all marketplaces:\n   ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/\n\n### For each marketplace found\n\nls {marketplace}/plugins/*/skills/\n4. Report to Claude:\nShow Claude the marketplace structure and ask it to use the skill directly from the discovered path.\n\nNote for AI assistants: When a user says \"use agent skill\" or \"use skill\" and the skill is not found via the Skill\ntool, automatically search marketplace directories as shown above before asking the user for guidance.\n\nWhere documents are stored\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThe implementation follows a 6-phase workflow:\n\n```nash\nPhase 0: Development Environment Initialization\n    ↓\nPhase 1: Deckrd Session & Task Information Extraction\n    ↓\nPhase 2: Task Breakdown (Fine-grained Subtasks)\n    ↓\nPhase 3: Red-Green-Refactor Implementation (via bdd-coder)\n    ↓\nPhase 4: Quality Gates (Lint, Type Check, Tests)\n    ↓\nPhase 5: Completion Verification\n```\n\n### The 8-Step Implementation Process\n\n1. **Step 1**: Retrieve quality gate commands\n2. **Step 2**: Extract implementation task list\n3. **Step 3-4**: BDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)\n4. **Step 5**: Execute quality gates\n5. **Step 6**: Record progress\n6. **Step 7**: Refactor phase (code cleanup)\n7. **Step 8**: Completion check\n\nFor detailed implementation steps, see `IMPLEMENTATION.md` in the skill documentation.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### ✅ What deckrd-coder Does\n\n- Implements tasks up to completion\n- Runs all tests and quality checks\n- Records changes and progress\n- Updates project memory with implementation details\n\n### ❌ What deckrd-coder Does NOT Do\n\n- Does not commit: Manual git commit required after verification\n- Does not push: Push to remote is user's responsibility\n- Does not support options: `--debug` and `--refresh-memory` are not currently implemented\n\n## Task ID Format\n\nTwo formats are supported:\n\n| Format     | Example     | Notes                         |\n| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Section ID | `T01-02`    | **Recommended** (single task) |\n| Detail ID  | `T01-02-01` | Not recommended (task detail) |\n\nUse Section ID format for single task implementation.\n\n## Documentation\n\nComprehensive documentation is included:\n\n- SKILL.md: Command reference and feature overview\n- WORKFLOW.md: 6-phase workflow details\n- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Step-by-step implementation guide\n- TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Error handling and recovery\n- FAQ.md: Common questions and answers\n- bdd-coder.md: Internal agent specification\n\nAll documentation is located in `skills/deckrd-coder/references/`\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Single Task Implementation\n\n```bash\n/deckrd-coder T01-02          # Implement task T01-02\n# Wait for completion\n# Verify changes\n# Manual git commit\n```\n\n### Multiple Tasks (Sequential)\n\n```bash\n/deckrd-coder T01-02          # Complete T01-02\n/deckrd-coder T01-03          # Then implement T01-03\n/deckrd-coder T01-04          # Then implement T01-04\n```\n\n> **Important**: Implement one task at a time (1 message = 1 task principle)\n\n## Integration with Deckrd\n\ndeckrd-coder is designed to work seamlessly within Deckrd sessions:\n\n1. Start a Deckrd session with `/deckrd init`\n2. Work through phases to define tasks in `tasks.md`\n3. Use `/deckrd-coder <TASK_ID>` to implement each task\n4. All implementations are automatically tracked in project memory\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\nCopyright (C) 2025- aglabo\n",
