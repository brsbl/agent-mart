        "README.md": "# Skills for Non-Coder\n\n[English](./README.md) | [中文](./README_CN.md)\n\nA collection of specialized agent skills designed for **non-coders** to handle media, content processing, and file management tasks. Perform complex operations through simple AI instructions.\n\n## Skills\n\n### File Management (macOS)\n\n#### [file-master](./file-master)\nMac file management master - a prompt-only orchestration skill that chains disk-cleaner, file-organizer, and doc-mindmap into a \"Clean > Organize > Analyze\" three-phase workflow.\n\n#### [disk-cleaner](./disk-cleaner)\nSmart Mac disk cleaning assistant powered by [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole). Features three-tier cleanup strategies (Air/Pro/Max), whitelist protection, categorized reports, and achievement pages.\n\n#### [file-organizer](./file-organizer)\nSmart Mac file organizer focused on sorting office documents in the Downloads folder. Supports manual mode (Smart Folders) and auto mode (sort by type), with disk-cleaner whitelist integration.\n\n#### [doc-mindmap](./doc-mindmap)\nDocument intelligence assistant - batch convert office documents to Markdown, generate summaries via local Ollama models, and create three-dimension symlink classification (topic/usage/client) with zero extra disk usage.\n\n### Media Processing\n\n#### [pdf-to-images](./pdf-to-images)\nConvert PDF files into a series of high-quality images (PNG/JPG) using ImageMagick. Useful for extracting slides or creating previews.\n\n#### [podcast-downloader](./podcast-downloader)\nDownload podcast episodes efficiently from Apple Podcasts. Features iTunes API integration for speed, with robust RSS fallback and metadata extraction.\n\n#### [srt-title-generator](./srt-title-generator)\nAnalyze SRT subtitle files to generate engaging, viral-potential video titles. Optimized for platforms like YouTube, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu.\n\n#### [youtube-downloader](./youtube-downloader)\nA powerful video downloader wrapping `yt-dlp`. Supports downloading videos, playlists, subtitles, and metadata from YouTube and 1000+ other sites.\n\n## Prerequisites & Limitations\n\nWhile most skills are cross-platform, some have specific system requirements:\n\n- **disk-cleaner / file-organizer / file-master**: **macOS Only**\n- **disk-cleaner**: Requires [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole) (`brew install tw93/tap/mole`)\n- **doc-mindmap**: Requires [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) (`pip install 'markitdown[all]'`) and optionally [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for summaries\n- **pdf-to-images**: Requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)\n- **youtube-downloader**: Requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for audio extraction\n\nAll scripts assume a working **Python 3.10+** environment.\n\n## Usage\n\nThese skills are structured for use with Claude Code or similar agentic environments.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add crazynomad/skills\n```\n\nFor more details, visit **https://skills.sh/docs**.\n\n## Structure\n\nEach skill is contained in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file defining its interface, usage, and dependencies.\n\n```\nskills/\n├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n├── file-master/\n├── disk-cleaner/\n├── file-organizer/\n├── doc-mindmap/\n├── pdf-to-images/\n├── podcast-downloader/\n├── srt-title-generator/\n├── youtube-downloader/\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThese skills stand on the shoulders of giants:\n\n- **[Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole)** - Core engine for macOS system cleaning.\n- **[markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)** - Microsoft's document-to-Markdown converter.\n- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** - Local LLM runtime for document summarization and classification.\n- **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)** - The backbone of our video downloading capabilities.\n- **[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)** - Powering our PDF to image conversion.\n- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** - Essential for high-quality audio extraction and video processing.\n- **[Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)** & **[Feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)** - Reliable tools for API interaction and RSS parsing.\n\nWe are grateful to the maintainers and contributors of these projects for their dedication to open-source software.\n"
