        "plugins/coding-workflows/README.md": "# Coding Workflows Plugin\n\nEngineering workflow commands for planning, reviewing, and executing GitHub issues with dynamically discovered specialist agents.\n\nCommands define **what** to do. Skills provide the **patterns and knowledge**.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install coding-workflows@ai-coding-resources\n\n# Plan and review an issue\n/coding-workflows:prepare-issue 42\n\n# Execute the reviewed plan\n/coding-workflows:execute-issue 42\n```\n\nThat's it. The plugin auto-detects your project settings.\n\nFor full project initialization (config, agents, skills):\n\n```bash\n/coding-workflows:setup\n```\n\n### Which command should I run?\n\n```\nInstall plugin\n     |\n     v\nDo you want custom config? --no--> /coding-workflows:create-issue github <desc>\n     |                                    |\n    yes                                   v\n     |                              /coding-workflows:prepare-issue <issue>\n     v                                    |\n/coding-workflows:setup                   v\n     |                              /coding-workflows:execute-issue <issue>\n     v\n/coding-workflows:create-issue github <desc>\n     |\n     v\n/coding-workflows:prepare-issue <issue>\n     |\n     v\n/coding-workflows:execute-issue <issue>\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated\n- Git repository with a GitHub remote\n- v3 supports GitHub only\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install coding-workflows@ai-coding-resources\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Tier 1: Zero Config\n\nInstall the plugin and run any command. Project settings (org, repo, language, test commands) are auto-detected from your git remote and project files.\n\nIf auto-detection gets something wrong, you'll be asked to confirm before proceeding.\n\n*Ready for more control? Move to Tier 2.*\n\n### Tier 2: Configured\n\nRun `/coding-workflows:init-config` to generate `.claude/workflow.yaml` with your project's test, lint, typecheck, and branch pattern settings. Commands read this config instead of auto-detecting.\n\nSee [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference) for the full schema.\n\n*Want specialist design sessions? Move to Tier 3.*\n\n### Tier 3: Full Setup\n\nRun `/coding-workflows:setup` for unified project initialization. This command orchestrates everything in one pass:\n\n1. CLAUDE.md check (project context)\n2. `workflow.yaml` generation (configuration)\n3. Project-specific skills (conventions and patterns)\n4. Project-specific agents (specialist expertise, with `skills:` cross-references)\n\nOr use `/coding-workflows:generate-assets` for finer control:\n- `/coding-workflows:generate-assets` -- generate both skills and agents\n- `/coding-workflows:generate-assets skills` -- generate skills only\n- `/coding-workflows:generate-assets agents` -- generate agents only\n- `/coding-workflows:generate-assets review-config` -- generate project-specific review focus areas\n- `/coding-workflows:generate-assets all` -- generate skills, agents, and review config\n\nCommands orchestrate the workflow. Skills teach the knowledge. Agents bring project-specific expertise.\n\n## Command Reference\n\n### Setup\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:init-config` | Bootstrap workflow.yaml by auto-detecting project settings |\n| `/coding-workflows:generate-assets [mode]` | Generate project-specific agents and skills by scanning the codebase |\n| `/coding-workflows:setup` | Unified idempotent project initialization -- CLAUDE.md, config, agents, skills, and hooks |\n| `/coding-workflows:help` | Quick reference for all coding workflow commands |\n\n### Issue Management\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:create-issue <platform> <desc>` | Create a well-structured issue in your tracker (GitHub, Linear, Jira, Asana)\\* |\n\n\\* `/coding-workflows:create-issue` operates independently of `workflow.yaml` configuration.\n\n### Pipeline\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue <issue>` | Full preparation pipeline - design session, plan, review, revised plan. Stops for human approval before execution. |\n\n### Building Blocks\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:design-session <subject>` | Run a technical design session on an issue, PR, file, or topic with dynamically discovered specialist agents |\n| `/coding-workflows:plan-issue <issue>` | Draft a specialist-reviewed implementation plan (honors prior design-session decisions), then auto-chain into adversarial review |\n| `/coding-workflows:review-plan <issue>` | Adversarial review of an implementation plan; posts revised plan if blocking issues found |\n| `/coding-workflows:review-pr <pr>` | Review a pull request for quality, compliance, and merge readiness using severity-tiered findings |\n| `/coding-workflows:execute-issue <issue>` | Implement a planned+reviewed issue using TDD; creates feature branch, opens PR, and manages review loop (up to 3 iterations) |\n\n> **Important:** `/coding-workflows:plan-issue`, `/coding-workflows:review-plan`, `/coding-workflows:review-pr`, `/coding-workflows:design-session`, `/coding-workflows:create-issue`, and `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue` post comments or issues to GitHub automatically without prompting for confirmation. Review the output on the issue or PR after it's posted.\n\n> **Note:** `/coding-workflows:execute-issue` verifies a reviewed plan exists before starting. If no plan is found, it stops and directs you to run `/coding-workflows:plan-issue` first.\n\n## Skill Reference\n\nSkills auto-activate based on context (triggers and domains in frontmatter). Manual invocation uses the namespaced form: `/coding-workflows:<skill-name>`.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `coding-workflows:agent-patterns` | Documents agent frontmatter metadata spec and patterns for creating effective project-specific agents |\n| `coding-workflows:agent-team-protocol` | Governs parallel code execution teams with file ownership, TDD workflow, git coordination, and team lifecycle management |\n| `coding-workflows:asset-discovery` | Discovers existing skills and agents across project, user, and plugin layers and provides similarity heuristics for detecting overlapping assets |\n| `coding-workflows:codebase-analysis` | Criteria for analyzing codebases to inform agent and skill generation |\n| `coding-workflows:deliberation-protocol` | Governs multi-round specialist deliberation for design sessions, plan reviews, and adversarial dispatch |\n| `coding-workflows:issue-workflow` | Structured workflow for planning and executing GitHub issues |\n| `coding-workflows:issue-writer` | Writes requirements-focused issues that describe what needs to be done, not how to implement it. Works with any tracker (GitHub, Linear, Jira, Asana). |\n| `coding-workflows:pr-review` | Framework for reviewing pull requests with severity-tiered findings, ecosystem-adapted focus areas, and strict exit criteria |\n| `coding-workflows:stack-detection` | Technology stack detection reference tables and per-stack analysis guidance. Maps project files to languages, dependencies to frameworks, and directory structures to domains |\n| `coding-workflows:systematic-debugging` | Structured debugging methodology for hypothesis-driven failure resolution. Encodes failure classification, evidence hierarchy, hypothesis quality criteria, and escalation thresholds |\n| `coding-workflows:tdd-patterns` | Stack-aware TDD patterns, anti-patterns, and quality heuristics for test-driven development |\n\n## Hooks\n\nThe plugin ships lifecycle hooks that enforce workflow rules automatically. Hooks activate on plugin install -- no configuration needed.\n\n### Shipped Hooks\n\n| Hook | Event | Behavior | What It Enforces |\n|------|-------|----------|------------------|\n| `test-evidence-logger` | PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure | Advisory (exit 0) | Logs test/lint evidence to session trail; warns on failure with Verification Gate reminder |\n| `deferred-work-scanner` | PostToolUse | Advisory (exit 0) | Scans PR body at creation time for untracked deferral language without issue links |\n| `stop-deferred-work-check` | Stop | Advisory (exit 0) | Warns when deferred work is detected in the transcript without follow-up issue references |\n| `execute-issue-completion-gate` | Stop | Blocking (exit 2, escalates after threshold) | Prevents premature session exit when open PR has incomplete CI checks. With `review_gate: true`, also enforces review verdict polling. |\n| `check-agent-output-completeness` | SubagentStop | Blocking (lenient) | Validates subagent output contains expected structured sections based on agent role |\n\n### Disabling Hooks\n\nEach hook can be disabled individually via environment variable:\n\n```bash\n# PostToolUse hooks\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_TEST_EVIDENCE_LOGGER=1\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_DEFERRED_WORK_SCANNER=1\n\n# Stop hooks\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_STOP_DEFERRED_WORK=1\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_EXECUTE_ISSUE_COMPLETION_GATE=1\n\n# SubagentStop hooks\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_AGENT_OUTPUT_COMPLETENESS=1\n```\n\nThe completion gate escalation threshold and review gate can be configured:\n\n```bash\n# Default is 3 -- after this many blocked stops, the hook degrades to advisory\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_ESCALATION_THRESHOLD=5\n```\n\nOr via `workflow.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\n# In .claude/workflow.yaml:\nhooks:\n  execute_issue_completion_gate:\n    review_gate: true       # Enable review verdict polling (default: false)\n    escalation_threshold: 5 # Override blocked-stop threshold (default: 3)\n```\n\nEnvironment variables take precedence over `workflow.yaml` values.\n\n### Hook Merging\n\nPlugin hooks merge with your user-level hooks (defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json`) and run in parallel. Plugin hooks do not replace or conflict with user hooks.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- The **PostToolUse evidence logger** (`test-evidence-logger`) always exits 0. If it cannot parse input or match commands, it silently succeeds. On test failure, it injects advisory context but never blocks.\n- The **PostToolUse deferral scanner** (`deferred-work-scanner`) always exits 0. If `gh` is unavailable or the PR cannot be fetched, it silently succeeds. Only fires on `gh pr create` commands.\n- The **Stop advisory hook** (`stop-deferred-work-check`) always exits 0. If it cannot parse input or read the transcript, it silently succeeds.\n- The **Stop completion gate** (`execute-issue-completion-gate`) fails open: if `gh` is unavailable, not authenticated, or returns errors, it warns and allows the stop. After the escalation threshold (default 3 blocked stops), it degrades to advisory mode. CI checking is always active; review verdict polling requires `review_gate: true` in workflow.yaml. This is an intentional departure from the advisory-only pattern -- the escalation counter prevents infinite loops while providing deterministic enforcement.\n- The **SubagentStop hook** (`check-agent-output-completeness`) fails open: if it cannot read the transcript or patterns config, it allows the subagent to complete. Only blocks when all required sections are missing AND output is suspiciously short (< 200 chars).\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nConfiguration lives in `.claude/workflow.yaml`. Run `/coding-workflows:init-config` to generate it, or create it manually. See `templates/workflow.yaml` for the full schema with examples for Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and Ruby.\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `project` | Repo identity: org, name, language, git provider |\n| `commands` | Test (focused + full), lint, typecheck, branch pattern |\n| `planning` | Always-include agents, reference docs |\n| `deliberation` | Conflict overrides for multi-round specialist dispatch |\n| `hooks` | Hook behavior overrides (e.g., escalation threshold) |\n\n## Agent Discovery\n\nWorkflow commands discover agents by scanning `.claude/agents/*.md` and reading their YAML frontmatter. Agents declare:\n\n- `domains` -- keywords for matching (e.g., `[api, routes, async]`)\n- `role` -- `specialist`, `reviewer`, or `architect`\n\nCommands match agents to workflow phases: domain specialists during planning, reviewers during pre-PR review, TDD-focused agents during execution. See the `coding-workflows:agent-patterns` skill for the full metadata spec and examples.\n\n## Skill Discovery\n\n**Bundled skills** ship with the plugin. They encode general-purpose workflow knowledge and are updated via plugin updates. These are read-only.\n\n**Project-specific skills** are generated by `/coding-workflows:generate-assets`. They encode your project's conventions, patterns, and domain knowledge. They live in `.claude/skills/` and are fully editable.\n\nSkills can include supporting files (templates, examples, reference data) in a `resources/` subdirectory alongside `SKILL.md`.\n\nBoth bundled and project-specific skills auto-activate based on their `triggers` and `domains` frontmatter fields.\n\n## Customization\n\nProjects can override any plugin command by placing a same-named file in their own `.claude/commands/` directory. Claude Code's local-wins precedence means project commands shadow plugin commands automatically.\n\nTo customize a command:\n1. Copy it from `plugins/coding-workflows/commands/` to `.claude/commands/`\n2. Edit the local copy\n3. The local version takes precedence\n\n## Experimental Features\n\nSet `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to enable agent team parallel execution.\n\nWhen enabled:\n- `/coding-workflows:execute-issue` can dispatch independent implementation layers to parallel agents via the `coding-workflows:agent-team-protocol` skill\n- The `coding-workflows:deliberation-protocol` skill uses TeamCreate/SendMessage-based multi-round dispatch\n\nWhen not set (default): all commands use Task-based sequential dispatch, which works for all users.\n\n## CI Review Setup\n\nThe `review-pr` command works identically from CLI and CI. This section covers running it automatically via GitHub Actions using [`anthropics/claude-code-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action). See the [FAQ](#faq) for how CI and CLI review relate.\n\nCI review works at any [Getting Started](#getting-started) tier. At Tier 1, project settings are auto-detected. At Tier 2+, the workflow reads `.claude/workflow.yaml` from the repo checkout.\n\n### Minimal Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: PR Review\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]\n    # Optional: scope to specific paths (see Customization below)\n    # paths:\n    #   - 'src/**'\n    #   - '!.github/workflows/**'\n\njobs:\n  review:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n      issues: write\n      actions: read\n      id-token: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 1  # Shallow clone is sufficient — review uses gh API, not local git history\n\n      - name: Run PR Review\n        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n          allowed_bots: 'claude[bot]'  # Prevents bot from re-triggering on its own comments\n          track_progress: false         # Command manages its own iteration tracking\n          use_sticky_comment: false     # Preserves review history across iterations\n          claude_args: |\n            --allowedTools \"Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(gh issue create:*),Bash(gh issue view:*),Bash(gh label create:*),Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)\"\n          prompt: |\n            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}\n            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n\n            You have the coding-workflows plugin installed.\n            Run the /coding-workflows:review-pr command for PR ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.\n\n            Use the REPO and PR NUMBER above for all operations.\n```\n\n> **Note:** This example assumes the `coding-workflows` plugin is installed in the repository. If the plugin is not installed, you can vendor the `review-pr` command by copying `commands/review-pr.md` to your repo and updating the prompt to reference the file path directly.\n\n> **Resilience:** For production CI, consider inlining fallback review rules directly in the workflow prompt. See [Inline fallback for production CI](#inline-fallback-for-production-ci) below.\n\n### Permissions, Secrets, and Inputs\n\n#### GitHub Workflow Permissions\n\n| Permission | Required | Purpose |\n|------------|----------|---------|\n| `contents: read` | Yes | Read repository files during checkout and review |\n| `pull-requests: write` | Yes | Post review comments on the PR |\n| `issues: write` | Yes | CREATE ISSUE protocol — files follow-up issues for non-blocking findings |\n| `actions: read` | Yes | Required by `claude-code-action` internals |\n| `id-token: write` | Yes | OIDC token exchange for `claude-code-action` authentication |\n\nWithout `issues: write`, reviews still run and post comments, but the CREATE ISSUE protocol fails silently — follow-up issues won't be created.\n\n#### Repository Secrets\n\n| Secret | Required | Purpose |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Yes | Authenticates `claude-code-action`. See the [setup guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for how to obtain the token. |\n\n#### Action Inputs\n\n| Input | Required | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| `allowed_bots` | Yes | Set to `'claude[bot]'` to prevent the bot from re-triggering the workflow on its own review comments. Without this, the workflow can infinite-loop. Adjust if using a custom Claude integration with a different bot identity. |\n\n### Allowed Tools\n\nThe `--allowedTools` flag restricts which tools Claude can use during CI review. This is a security boundary — general `Bash` access is intentionally excluded.\n\n| Tool Pattern | Purpose |\n|-------------|---------|\n| `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` | File analysis — read and search repository files |\n| `Bash(gh pr view:*)` | Fetch PR metadata and count review iterations |\n| `Bash(gh pr diff:*)` | Fetch PR diff for review |\n| `Bash(gh pr comment:*)` | Post the review comment |\n| `Bash(gh issue create:*)` | Create follow-up issues (CREATE ISSUE protocol) |\n| `Bash(gh issue view:*)` | Fetch linked issue for compliance check |\n| `Bash(gh label create:*)` | Ensure `review-followup` label exists |\n\nThe CI `--allowedTools` is more restrictive than the command's own `allowed-tools` declaration (which includes general `Bash` and `Task`). This is intentional: CLI usage has user oversight for each command, while CI runs unattended. In CI, general `Bash` access is scoped to specific `gh` subcommands for security, and `Task` (which enables sub-agents) is excluded entirely.\n\n### Customization\n\n**Path filters:** Add a `paths` block to scope which file changes trigger reviews. Use `!.github/workflows/**` to prevent the workflow from self-triggering.\n\nCommon patterns by ecosystem:\n\n| Ecosystem | Suggested paths |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| TypeScript/JavaScript | `'src/**'`, `'**.ts'`, `'**.tsx'` |\n| Python | `'**.py'`, `'pyproject.toml'` |\n| Ruby/Rails | `'app/**'`, `'lib/**'`, `'**.rb'` |\n| Go | `'**.go'`, `'go.mod'` |\n| Documentation | `'**.md'`, `'**.yaml'`, `'**.yml'` |\n\n**Sticky comments:** Set `use_sticky_comment: true` to update a single comment instead of posting new ones per iteration. Default `false` preserves review history.\n\n**Iteration behavior:** The command tracks iterations via HTML comment markers (`<!-- content-review-iteration:N -->`). Iterations 1-3 run comprehensive reviews; iterations 4+ switch to verification mode (only check previous MUST FIX items). New commits trigger re-review automatically via the `synchronize` event.\n\n**Project-specific review focus:** For more targeted reviews, generate a review config:\n\n```\n/coding-workflows:generate-assets review-config\n```\n\nThis produces `.claude/review-config.yaml` with project-specific correctness criteria, integrity checks, compliance conventions, and anti-patterns. Commit this file — the `review-pr` command reads it automatically in both CLI and CI. Without it, reviews use the universal framework.\n\n#### Inline fallback for production CI\n\nFor environments where plugin resolution may fail — production CI, airgapped networks, vendored command setups — inline critical review rules directly in the workflow prompt as a fallback. The command uses its own skill when available; inline rules ensure review coverage if resolution fails.\n\n> **YAML formatting:** Use the literal block scalar (`|`) for multi-line prompt content. This preserves line breaks and avoids escaping issues. Indent the prompt body consistently (2 spaces).\n\nExample workflow with inline fallback (extends the [minimal workflow](#minimal-workflow) above):\n\n```yaml\n      - name: Run PR Review\n        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n          allowed_bots: 'claude[bot]'\n          track_progress: false\n          use_sticky_comment: false\n          claude_args: |\n            --allowedTools \"Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(gh issue create:*),Bash(gh issue view:*),Bash(gh label create:*),Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)\"\n          prompt: |\n            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}\n            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n\n            You have the coding-workflows plugin installed.\n            Run the /coding-workflows:review-pr command for PR ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.\n\n            Use the REPO and PR NUMBER above for all operations.\n\n            ---\n            FALLBACK REVIEW RULES (apply if command or skill cannot be resolved;\n            this is a static snapshot from the pr-review skill and may drift from\n            skill updates -- use inline fallback only when resilience outweighs consistency):\n\n            ## Severity Tiers\n            Every finding must be classified into exactly one tier:\n            - MUST FIX: Blocks merge. Incorrect behavior, broken references, security issues, missing acceptance criteria.\n            - FIX NOW: Mandatory trivial fix. Small editorial fix that passes the Trivial Check below.\n            - CREATE ISSUE: Non-trivial, tracked. Valid concern requiring separate work; does not block merge once filed.\n\n            ## Trivial Check (FIX NOW vs CREATE ISSUE)\n            FIX NOW when ALL true:\n            - Single component change\n            - No structural metadata changes\n            - No new cross-component references\n            - No behavioral semantic changes\n            - Clearly editorial (typos, wording, formatting)\n\n            CREATE ISSUE when ANY true:\n            - Spans multiple components\n            - Changes structural metadata\n            - Changes behavioral logic or thresholds\n            - Introduces new cross-component references\n\n            ## Exit Criteria\n            \"Ready to merge\" ONLY when ALL true:\n            - Zero MUST FIX items remain\n            - Zero FIX NOW items remain\n            - All CREATE ISSUE items have been filed\n\n            NEVER use qualified approval:\n            - \"Ready to merge once items are addressed\" -- NO\n            - \"LGTM with minor changes\" -- NO\n            - \"Approved pending X\" -- NO\n\n            ## CREATE ISSUE Protocol\n            - ONE consolidated issue per review (not per finding)\n            - Label: review-followup\n            - Reference created issue number in review comment\n\n            ## Iteration Mode\n            - Iterations 1-3: COMPREHENSIVE (apply all review categories, raise every concern)\n            - Iterations 4+: VERIFICATION (only verify previous MUST FIX items are fixed)\n```\n\n> **Note:** Inline rules are a static snapshot from the `pr-review` skill. If the skill's severity tiers, exit criteria, or trivial check rules are updated, the inline copy may drift. Use inline fallback only when resilience outweighs consistency.\n\n**`ready_for_review` trigger:** The `ready_for_review` event type ensures PRs converted from draft to ready-for-review trigger a review. Remove it only if your team does not use draft PRs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What's the difference between `/coding-workflows:init-config`, `/coding-workflows:generate-assets`, and `/coding-workflows:setup`?**\n`init-config` only creates `.claude/workflow.yaml`. `generate-assets` generates agents and/or skills from a codebase scan (requires config). `setup` is the full pipeline: CLAUDE.md check, config, and asset generation in one pass. Use `setup` for initial project onboarding; use `init-config` when you only need the config file; use `generate-assets` when you want to regenerate agents/skills without re-running the full pipeline.\n\n**What's the difference between `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue` and `/coding-workflows:plan-issue`?**\n`prepare-issue` runs the full pipeline: design session + plan + review. `plan-issue` skips the design session and goes straight to planning. Use `prepare-issue` for complex issues that need architectural discussion; use `plan-issue` for straightforward implementation work.\n\n**What's the difference between CI review and CLI review?**\nBoth use the same `review-pr` command and `pr-review` skill. The command is CI/CLI agnostic — `gh` commands work in both environments. From CLI, run `/coding-workflows:review-pr <pr>` manually. For automated CI reviews on every pull request, see [CI Review Setup](#ci-review-setup).\n\n**How do I set up project-specific review focus?**\nRun `/coding-workflows:generate-assets review-config` to generate `.claude/review-config.yaml`. This scans your codebase and produces project-specific correctness criteria, integrity checks, compliance conventions, and anti-patterns. Without it, reviews use the universal framework from the `pr-review` skill.\n\n**Which commands post to GitHub automatically?**\n`/coding-workflows:plan-issue`, `/coding-workflows:review-plan`, `/coding-workflows:review-pr`, `/coding-workflows:design-session`, `/coding-workflows:create-issue`, and `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue` post comments or issues to GitHub without prompting. Review the output on the issue or PR after it's posted.\n\n**How do project settings persist across commands?**\nSettings are stored in `.claude/workflow.yaml`. Once created (via `init-config` or `setup`), all commands read from this file instead of auto-detecting. The file is committed to your repo and shared with your team.\n\n**Is `/coding-workflows:setup` safe to run multiple times?**\nYes. It's idempotent. Existing files are preserved. Stale config is detected and offered for update. Manual files are never overwritten.\n\n**Do I need agents configured?**\nNo. All commands work without agents. Agents enhance design sessions and reviews with project-specific expertise but are entirely optional.\n\n**What is the requirements gate on `/coding-workflows:execute-issue`?**\nThe command stops and tells you to run `/coding-workflows:plan-issue` first if no plan is found. It also checks for a review comment before proceeding. This ensures plans are challenged before implementation.\n\n**How do I customize a command?**\nCopy it to `.claude/commands/` with the same filename. Your local version takes precedence over the plugin version.\n\n**What happens if I run `/coding-workflows:execute-issue` without a plan?**\nThe command stops and tells you to run `/coding-workflows:plan-issue` first. It also checks for a review comment before proceeding.\n\n**Can I skip the design session and go straight to planning?**\nYes. Use `/coding-workflows:plan-issue` directly instead of `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue`.\n\n**How do I set up multi-round deliberation?**\nAdd conflict overrides to `.claude/workflow.yaml` under `deliberation.conflict_overrides`. When any specialist pair has a HIGH conflict override, multi-round dispatch activates automatically.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Issue is closed -- command fails**\nCommands that post to GitHub issues check the issue state. If the issue is closed, the command will stop. Reopen the issue first.\n\n**No plan found on issue**\n`/coding-workflows:execute-issue` requires a plan comment (starting with `## Implementation Plan`) on the issue. Run `/coding-workflows:plan-issue <issue>` first.\n\n**`gh` not found**\nInstall the GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com). Then authenticate with `gh auth login`.\n\n**Unexpected GitHub comments**\nCommands post to GitHub automatically. If you're surprised by comments appearing on issues, check the [FAQ](#faq) about auto-posting behavior. All workflow commands that post to GitHub are documented above.\n\n**Settings confirmation keeps appearing**\nIf you're repeatedly asked to confirm project settings, create a persistent config: `/coding-workflows:init-config`. Once `.claude/workflow.yaml` exists, auto-detection is skipped.\n\n**CI review posts no comment**\nVerify the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret is set in the repository settings. Check that `pull-requests: write` permission is configured in the workflow. See [CI Review Setup](#ci-review-setup).\n\n**CI review runs but follow-up issues are not created**\nThe CREATE ISSUE protocol requires `issues: write` permission. Without it, reviews post normally but follow-up issue creation fails silently. Add `issues: write` to the workflow permissions block.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
