        "README.md": "# AI Coding Resources\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace for engineering workflows.\n\n## coding-workflows\n\n**Stop vibe-coding your issue tracking.** This plugin gives Claude Code a structured workflow for taking GitHub issues from idea to merged PR — with design sessions, adversarial plan review, and TDD execution built in.\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"559\" alt=\"The Process: From Issue to Merged PR with Claude Code Plugin\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51476839-c380-4c5c-912f-fec6ce4ba7b4\" />\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code:\n/plugin marketplace add Kiwi-Home/ai-coding-resources\n/plugin install coding-workflows@ai-coding-resources\n```\n\n### Try It\n\n```bash\n# Turn a vague idea into a structured issue with requirements and acceptance criteria\n/coding-workflows:create-issue github \"users can't reset their password if they signed up with SSO\"\n\n# The full pipeline: triage → design → plan → adversarial review\n/coding-workflows:prepare-issue 42\n\n# Implement with TDD, open PR, run review loop\n/coding-workflows:execute-issue 42\n```\n\nThat's it. Project settings are auto-detected from your git remote and project files.\n\n### What It Does\n\n**Issue creation** — `/create-issue` writes requirements-focused issues with acceptance criteria. Describes *what*, not *how*.\n\n**Design sessions** — `/design-session` spawns 3-4 specialist agents that independently analyse the problem, then synthesises findings with explicit conflict resolution. No premature consensus.\n\n**Implementation planning** — `/plan-issue` produces a specialist-reviewed implementation plan with mandatory codebase exploration and build-vs-buy research. Then `/review-plan` tears it apart before any code is written.\n\n**TDD execution** — `/execute-issue` implements the reviewed plan using test-driven development with verification gates. Creates a feature branch, runs tests, opens a PR.\n\n**PR review** — `/review-pr` reviews pull requests with severity-tiered findings (MUST FIX / FIX NOW / CREATE ISSUE). Works from CLI or as a GitHub Actions CI check.\n\n**Complexity triage** — `/prepare-issue` assesses issue complexity and routes to the appropriate depth: solo mode for trivial fixes, lightweight for standard work, full deliberation for cross-cutting changes.\n\n### What You Get\n\n| | Count | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Commands** | 15 | `prepare-issue`, `execute-issue`, `review-pr`, `setup`, `create-issue` |\n| **Skills** | 14 | TDD patterns, systematic debugging, issue writing, PR review framework |\n| **Hooks** | 6 | Dependency version checks, test evidence logging, deferred work scanning |\n\n### Three Tiers\n\n**Zero config** — Install and run. Everything auto-detects.\n\n**Configured** — Run `/init-config` to generate `.claude/workflow.yaml` with your test, lint, and branch settings.\n\n**Full setup** — Run `/setup` for the complete experience: CLAUDE.md check, config, project-specific skills and specialist agents generated from your codebase.\n\n### CI Review\n\nAdd automated PR review to your GitHub Actions pipeline:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Run PR Review\n  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n  with:\n    claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n    prompt: |\n      Run /coding-workflows:review-pr for PR ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.\n```\n\nSee the [full CI setup guide](plugins/coding-workflows/README.md#ci-review-setup) for permissions, allowed tools, and customisation options.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe [plugin README](plugins/coding-workflows/README.md) has the full command reference, skill reference, hook configuration, FAQ, and troubleshooting guide.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Claude Code with plugin support\n- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated\n- Git repository with a GitHub remote\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/coding-workflows/README.md": "# coding-workflows\n\nEngineering workflow commands for Claude Code. Plan, review, and execute GitHub issues with dynamically discovered specialist agents.\n\nCommands define **what** to do. Skills provide **patterns and knowledge**. Hooks enforce **workflow rules** automatically.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install\n/plugin marketplace add Kiwi-Home/ai-coding-resources\n/plugin install coding-workflows@ai-coding-resources\n\n# Turn a vague idea into a structured issue\n/coding-workflows:create-issue github \"users can't reset their password if they signed up with SSO\"\n\n# Run the full pipeline on an issue\n/coding-workflows:prepare-issue 42\n\n# Execute the reviewed plan\n/coding-workflows:execute-issue 42\n```\n\nThe plugin auto-detects your project settings. For full project initialisation (config, agents, skills): `/coding-workflows:setup`.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated\n- Git repository with a GitHub remote\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\n/prepare-issue 42\n     │\n     ├─ Complexity triage (solo / lightweight / full)\n     │\n     ├─ Design session (3-4 specialists, conflict resolution)\n     │\n     ├─ Implementation plan (codebase exploration, build-vs-buy)\n     │\n     └─ Adversarial review (blocks until plan passes)\n\n/execute-issue 42\n     │\n     ├─ Verifies reviewed plan exists\n     │\n     ├─ Creates feature branch\n     │\n     ├─ TDD implementation with verification gates\n     │\n     └─ Opens PR, runs review loop\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Tier 1: Zero Config\n\nInstall and run. Project settings (org, repo, language, test commands) are auto-detected from your git remote and project files.\n\n### Tier 2: Configured\n\nRun `/coding-workflows:init-config` to generate `.claude/workflow.yaml` with your test, lint, typecheck, and branch pattern settings. Commands read this config instead of auto-detecting.\n\n### Tier 3: Full Setup\n\nRun `/coding-workflows:setup` for unified project initialisation:\n\n1. CLAUDE.md check (project context)\n2. `workflow.yaml` generation (configuration)\n3. Project-specific skills (conventions and patterns from your codebase)\n4. Project-specific agents (specialist expertise with cross-referenced skills)\n\n## Command Reference\n\n### The Pipeline\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:create-issue <platform> <desc>` | Create a well-structured issue in your tracker (GitHub, Linear, Jira, Asana) |\n| `/coding-workflows:prepare-issue <issue> [mode]` | Full preparation pipeline with complexity triage |\n| `/coding-workflows:execute-issue <issue>` | Implement a planned+reviewed issue using TDD; creates feature branch, opens PR, and manages review loop (up to 3 iterations) |\n| `/coding-workflows:execute-issue-worktree <issue>` | Execute a planned+reviewed issue in an isolated git worktree |\n\n### Building Blocks\n\nUse these individually when you don't need the full pipeline:\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:design-session <subject>` | Run a technical design session on an issue, PR, file, or topic with dynamically discovered specialist agents |\n| `/coding-workflows:plan-issue <issue>` | Draft a specialist-reviewed implementation plan (honors prior design-session decisions) |\n| `/coding-workflows:review-plan <issue>` | Adversarial review of an implementation plan; posts revised plan if blocking issues found |\n| `/coding-workflows:review-pr <pr>` | Review a pull request for quality, compliance, and merge readiness using severity-tiered findings |\n\n### Setup & Maintenance\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/coding-workflows:setup` | Unified idempotent project initialization -- CLAUDE.md, config, agents, skills, and hooks |\n| `/coding-workflows:init-config` | Bootstrap workflow.yaml by auto-detecting project settings |\n| `/coding-workflows:generate-assets [mode]` | Generate project-specific agents and skills by scanning the codebase |\n| `/coding-workflows:merge-issue <issue>` | Merge a PR and clean up branch + worktree for a completed issue |\n| `/coding-workflows:cleanup-worktree <issue>` | Remove worktree and branch for a completed issue; idempotent with unmerged-changes safety check |\n| `/coding-workflows:check-updates [sources]` | Check upstream dependencies for new releases and changelog updates; produces a local markdown digest with change tiers |\n| `/coding-workflows:help` | Quick reference for all coding workflow commands |\n\n> **Auto-posting:** `plan-issue`, `review-plan`, `review-pr`, `design-session`, `create-issue`, and `prepare-issue` post comments or issues to GitHub automatically. Review the output after it's posted.\n\n> **Plan gate:** `execute-issue` verifies a reviewed plan exists before starting. If none is found, it directs you to run `plan-issue` first.\n\n## Skill Reference\n\nSkills auto-activate based on context. Manual invocation: `/coding-workflows:<skill-name>`.\n\n### Workflow Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `issue-workflow` | Structured workflow for planning and executing GitHub issues |\n| `issue-writer` | Writes requirements-focused issues that describe what needs to be done, not how to implement it |\n| `complexity-triage` | Complexity assessment framework for routing issues to appropriate preparation depth |\n| `deliberation-protocol` | Governs multi-round specialist deliberation for design sessions, plan reviews, and adversarial dispatch |\n| `agent-team-protocol` | Governs parallel code execution teams with file ownership, TDD workflow, git coordination, and team lifecycle management |\n\n### Knowledge Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `tdd-patterns` | Stack-aware TDD patterns, anti-patterns, and quality heuristics |\n| `systematic-debugging` | Structured debugging methodology for hypothesis-driven failure resolution |\n| `pr-review` | Framework for reviewing pull requests with severity-tiered findings, ecosystem-adapted focus areas, and strict exit criteria |\n| `knowledge-freshness` | Staleness triage framework for evaluating when training data is reliable vs. when verification is required |\n\n### Asset Management Skills\n\n| Skill | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `skill-creator` | Guides creation of effective skills that extend Claude with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations |\n| `agent-patterns` | Documents agent frontmatter metadata spec and patterns for creating effective project-specific agents |\n| `asset-discovery` | Discovers existing skills and agents across project, user, and plugin layers and provides similarity heuristics for detecting overlapping assets |\n| `stack-detection` | Technology stack detection reference tables and per-stack analysis guidance |\n| `codebase-analysis` | Criteria for analyzing codebases to inform agent and skill generation |\n\n## Shipped Hooks\n\nHooks activate on install — no configuration needed.\n\n| Hook | Event | Behaviour |\n|------|-------|-----------|\n| `check-dependency-version` | PreToolUse | Warns when dependency-add commands lack version pins |\n| `test-evidence-logger` | PostToolUse | Logs test/lint evidence to session trail |\n| `deferred-work-scanner` | PostToolUse | Scans PR body for untracked deferrals |\n| `stop-deferred-work-check` | Stop | Warns about deferred work without follow-up issues |\n| `execute-issue-completion-gate` | Stop | Prevents premature exit with incomplete CI checks |\n| `check-agent-output-completeness` | SubagentStop | Validates subagent output contains expected sections |\n\nDisable any hook with an environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_DEPENDENCY_VERSION_CHECK=1\nexport CODING_WORKFLOWS_DISABLE_HOOK_TEST_EVIDENCE_LOGGER=1\n# ... see Configuration Reference for the full list\n```\n\nOr configure via `workflow.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhooks:\n  check_dependency_version:\n    mode: block              # Switch from advisory to blocking\n  execute_issue_completion_gate:\n    review_gate: true        # Enable review verdict polling\n    escalation_threshold: 5  # Override blocked-stop threshold\n```\n\nPlugin hooks merge with your user-level hooks and run in parallel — they never replace or conflict with user hooks.\n\n## Configuration Reference\n\nConfiguration lives in `.claude/workflow.yaml`. Run `/coding-workflows:init-config` to generate it.\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `project` | Repo identity: org, name, language, git provider |\n| `commands` | Test (focused + full), lint, typecheck, branch pattern |\n| `planning` | Always-include agents, reference docs |\n| `deliberation` | Conflict overrides for multi-round specialist dispatch |\n| `hooks` | Hook behaviour overrides |\n\nSee `templates/workflow.yaml` for the full schema with examples for Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and Ruby.\n\n## Agent Discovery\n\nCommands discover agents by scanning `.claude/agents/*.md` and reading YAML frontmatter:\n\n- `domains` — keywords for matching (e.g., `[api, routes, async]`)\n- `role` — `specialist`, `reviewer`, or `architect`\n\nCommands match agents to workflow phases: domain specialists during planning, reviewers during PR review, TDD-focused agents during execution. See `coding-workflows:agent-patterns` for the full metadata spec.\n\n## CI Review Setup\n\nThe `review-pr` command works identically from CLI and CI. To automate it on every pull request, create `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nname: PR Review\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]\n\njobs:\n  review:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      pull-requests: write\n      issues: write\n      actions: read\n      id-token: write\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 1\n\n      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n        with:\n          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n          allowed_bots: 'claude[bot]'\n          track_progress: false\n          use_sticky_comment: false\n          claude_args: |\n            --allowedTools \"Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(gh issue create:*),Bash(gh issue view:*),Bash(gh label create:*),Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)\"\n          prompt: |\n            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}\n            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n            You have the coding-workflows plugin installed.\n            Run the /coding-workflows:review-pr command for PR ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.\n            Use the REPO and PR NUMBER above for all operations.\n```\n\n**Required secrets:** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — see the [claude-code-action setup guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action).\n\n**Permissions:** `issues: write` enables the CREATE ISSUE protocol for follow-up issues. Without it, reviews still post but follow-up issues fail silently.\n\n**Iteration behaviour:** Iterations 1-3 run comprehensive reviews. Iterations 4+ switch to verification mode (only checks previous MUST FIX items).\n\n**Project-specific focus:** Run `/coding-workflows:generate-assets review-config` to generate `.claude/review-config.yaml` with project-specific review criteria. The command reads it automatically in both CLI and CI.\n\nFor advanced CI configuration (inline fallback rules, path filters, allowed tools detail), see the [CI deep dive](docs/ci-review.md).\n\n## Customisation\n\nOverride any command by placing a same-named file in `.claude/commands/`. Claude Code's local-wins precedence means your version shadows the plugin version automatically.\n\n## Experimental: Agent Teams\n\nSet `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to enable parallel agent execution during implementation. When enabled, `execute-issue` can dispatch independent layers to parallel agents. When not set, all commands use sequential dispatch.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**`prepare-issue` vs `plan-issue`?** `prepare-issue` runs the full pipeline (triage → design → plan → review). `plan-issue` skips design and goes straight to planning. Use `prepare-issue` for raw issues; `plan-issue` when design decisions are already clear.\n\n**`init-config` vs `generate-assets` vs `setup`?** `init-config` creates workflow.yaml only. `generate-assets` generates agents/skills from a codebase scan. `setup` does everything in one pass. Use `setup` for initial onboarding.\n\n**CLI review vs CI review?** Same command, same skill. `/review-pr <pr>` from the terminal, or automate via GitHub Actions. See [CI Review Setup](#ci-review-setup).\n\n**Do I need agents?** No. All commands work without agents. Agents enhance design sessions and reviews with project-specific expertise but are entirely optional.\n\n**Is `setup` safe to re-run?** Yes. It's idempotent. Existing files are preserved. Stale config is detected and offered for update.\n\n**How do I customise a command?** Copy it to `.claude/commands/` with the same filename. Your version takes precedence.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**`gh` not found** — Install: `brew install gh` (macOS) or [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com). Authenticate: `gh auth login`.\n\n**No plan found** — `execute-issue` requires a plan comment on the issue. Run `plan-issue` first.\n\n**Settings confirmation keeps appearing** — Create persistent config: `/coding-workflows:init-config`.\n\n**CI review posts no comment** — Check `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret and `pull-requests: write` permission.\n\n**CI follow-up issues not created** — Add `issues: write` to the workflow permissions.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
