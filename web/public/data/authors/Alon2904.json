        "README.md": "# Claude Code Skill Creator\n\nCreate custom Claude skills with a single command.\n\n## What is this?\n\nA Claude Code plugin that adds the `/create-skill` command. Use it to create skills that help Claude understand your project better.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Alon2904/claude-code-skill-creator\n```\n\nThat's it. You now have `/create-skill` available everywhere.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a skill for your project (recommended)\n\nNavigate to your project and run the command:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/my-fastapi-project\n/create-skill\n```\n\nClaude will:\n1. Ask what skill you want\n2. Analyze your project code\n3. Create a skill at `.claude/skills/` in your project\n4. The skill understands YOUR code, YOUR patterns\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/create-skill\n> \"Create a skill that helps write tests for our FastAPI endpoints\"\n\n✅ Skill created at .claude/skills/api-test-helper/\n```\n\nNow when you ask Claude to write tests, it knows:\n- Your test structure and fixtures\n- Your database models\n- Your API patterns and conventions\n- How to write tests that fit your project\n\n### Create a skill to share\n\nWant to create a general-purpose skill to share with others?\n\n```bash\ncd ~/any-folder\n/create-skill\n> \"JSON validator and formatter\"\n\n✅ Skill created and packaged as json-validator.zip\n```\n\nShare the .zip with your team or upload to Claude.ai.\n\n## How it works\n\n**When run in your project:**\n- Skills are created at `.claude/skills/` in your project\n- Claude has full context of your codebase\n- Skills are tailored to your specific code\n\n**When run elsewhere:**\n- Skills are packaged as .zip files\n- Easy to share and distribute\n\n## Example\n\nSee `examples/json-validator/` for a complete skill example.\n\n## What gets created?\n\nWhen you run `/create-skill`, you get:\n\n- **SKILL.md** - The main skill file with instructions for Claude\n- **scripts/** (optional) - Helper scripts for automation\n- **references/** (optional) - Reference documentation\n- **assets/** (optional) - Templates or boilerplate files\n- **[skill-name].zip** - Packaged skill ready to share\n\n## Development\n\nWant to contribute or test locally?\n\nSee [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions.\n\n### Quick Local Test\n\n```bash\n# Install from local directory\n/plugin add file:///path/to/claude-code-skill-creator\n\n# Test the command\n/create-skill\n```\n\n### Plugin Structure\n\n```\n.claude-plugin/          # Plugin metadata\n  ├── plugin.json        # Plugin manifest\n  └── marketplace.json   # Marketplace listing\ncommands/                # Plugin commands\n  └── create-skill.md    # The /create-skill command\nskills/                  # Supporting files\n  └── skill-creator/     # Anthropic's skill creation scripts\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nBuilt on [Anthropic's Skills System](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)\n\nUses Anthropic's official skill creation scripts.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE)\n"
