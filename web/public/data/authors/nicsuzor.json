        "README.md": "# academicOps\n\nA constitutional framework for governing autonomous AI agents with:\n\n1. **_Ultra vires_ detection** ensures that agents operate within zones of autonomy bounded by their grant of authority -- using public law theory to identify when discretionary choices become invalid.\n\n2. **A constitutional hierarchy of norms** (axioms → heuristics → enforcement rules) requires every operational rule to derive from a first principle, preventing governance bloat through the same derivation logic that constrains delegated legislation.\n\n3. **Commons-based peer review** applies the **bazaar** model of F/OSS peer production to AI governance. Instead of ex-ante rules, we encourage experimentation and collaborative work. Agents review each other's work through structured PR pipelines, the way open source maintainers govern contributions from autonomous participants at scale.\n\n4. **Doctrinal development** through structured session reflections means recurring friction gets named, codified, and promoted or demoted based on evidence -- the rule system grows incrementally, the way case law does.\n\n5. **Domain-specific academic tools** -- citation management (Zotero), research data analysis (dbt, Streamlit), document conversion, email triage, writing style enforcement.\n\n## The distributed review pipeline\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    PR([PR opened / updated]) --> CQ\n\n    subgraph CQ [Code Quality]\n        Lint[Ruff lint + format]\n        Gate[[Gatekeeper agent]]\n        Types[Type check]\n        Lint --> Types\n    end\n\n    subgraph Review [Sequential Review Pipeline]\n        direction TB\n        Cust[[Custodiet:<br/>scope compliance]]\n        Cust --> QA[[QA: acceptance<br/>criteria check]]\n        QA --> MP[[Merge Prep:<br/>auto-fix comments]]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Async [Advisory Review]\n        HydRev[[Hydrator reviewer]]\n        CustRev[[Custodiet reviewer]]\n    end\n\n    CQ -- all pass --> Review\n    PR -.-> Async\n\n    Review --> Notify([Ready for Review])\n    Notify --> Human([Human reviews])\n\n    Human -- LGTM --> AutoMerge([Auto-merge<br/>rebase])\n    AutoMerge -- conflicts --> Claude[[Claude resolves<br/>conflicts + pushes]]\n    AutoMerge -- clean --> Done([Merged])\n    Claude --> Done\n\n    classDef agent fill:#6a1b9a,stroke:#4a148c,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    classDef gate fill:#c62828,stroke:#b71c1c,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    classDef action fill:#0277bd,stroke:#01579b,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    classDef human fill:#ef6c00,stroke:#e65100,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    classDef success fill:#2e7d32,stroke:#1b5e20,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n\n    class Gate,Cust,QA,MP,HydRev,CustRev,Claude agent\n    class Lint,Types action\n    class Human human\n    class Done success\n\n    style CQ fill:none,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n    style Review fill:none,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n    style Async fill:none,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n```\n\n- **By the time the human sees the PR, everything should be clean.** Gatekeeper approves alignment (Approval #1), then custodiet, QA, and merge-prep run sequentially. Merge-prep auto-fixes review comments and pushes corrections.\n- Only humans can trigger merges. \"LGTM\" means **merge now** — it lodges Approval #2 and enables auto-merge (rebase). If merge conflicts exist, `@claude` is invoked to rebase and resolve them.\n- Hydrator and custodiet reviewers post non-blocking advisory comments on PR creation.\n- Full process documentation: [`specs/pr-process.md`](specs/pr-process.md).\n\n## Local session lifecycle\n\nEvery mutating operation passes through gates: active task (work tracking), hydrated execution plan (intent verification), periodic compliance audits (drift detection). Sessions end with structured reflection.\n\n## Hierarchy of norms\n\n| Level | Document | Role | Analogy |\n| ----- | -------- | ---- | ------- |\n| 1 | **AXIOMS.md** | Inviolable principles (30+) | Constitutional provisions |\n| 2 | **HEURISTICS.md** | Evidence-based working rules (40+) | Common law doctrine |\n| 3 | **enforcement-map.md** | Rule-to-mechanism mapping | Regulatory implementation |\n\nAxioms are inviolable: \"Fail-Fast\" means no defaults, no silent failures; \"Research Data Is Immutable\" means source datasets are sacred. Heuristics are working hypotheses that evolve through use — \"Subagent Verdicts Are Binding\" emerged after an agent ignored a compliance finding and introduced scope drift. New rules must derive from existing axioms; if they can't, either the rule is wrong or the axiom set is incomplete.\n\n## Graduated enforcement\n\n| Level | Mechanism | Example |\n| ----- | --------- | ------- |\n| **Hard gate** | Blocks action | Task binding for destructive ops |\n| **Soft gate** | Injects guidance | Hydrator suggests workflows |\n| **Periodic audit** | Every ~15 ops | Custodiet detects drift |\n| **Pre-commit** | Blocks commits | Orphan files, frontmatter validation |\n| **Prompt-level** | JIT injection | Relevant principles surfaced in context |\n\n## Feedback loop\n\nThe framework treats itself as a hypothesis under continuous test. Every session generates structured reflections and compliance data. Recurring friction gets named as doctrine. The `/learn` skill captures failures as structured knowledge, with fixes applied at the lowest effective level.\n\n## Memory architecture\n\n| Type | Storage | Example |\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| **Semantic** | `$ACA_DATA` markdown | Timeless knowledge |\n| **Episodic** | Task graph + git issues | Session observations |\n\n`$ACA_DATA` is a current state machine. Human-readable markdown in git, with a memory server providing semantic search over vector embeddings.\n\n## Agent architecture\n\n| Agent | Role |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| **prompt-hydrator** | Enriches prompts with context, selects workflows, applies guardrails |\n| **custodiet** | Live compliance audits — drift, violations, scope creep |\n| **critic** | Reviews execution plans for errors and hidden assumptions |\n| **qa** | Independent verification against acceptance criteria |\n| **effectual-planner** | Strategic planning under genuine uncertainty |\n\n## Skills and commands\n\n24 skills, 7 commands. Skills are fungible. Key examples:\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/analyst` | Research data analysis (dbt, Streamlit, stats) |\n| `/strategy` | Strategic thinking under uncertainty |\n| `/swarm-supervisor` | Parallel worker orchestration with isolated worktrees |\n| `/hdr` | Higher degree research supervision workflows |\n| `/remember` | Dual-write to markdown + memory server |\n| `/learn` | Capture failures as structured knowledge |\n| `/pull` `/q` `/dump` | Task queue lifecycle |\n\n## Installation\n\nDistribution repository: https://github.com/nicsuzor/aops-dist\n\nSet the data directory environment variable in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:\n\n```bash\nexport ACA_DATA=\"$HOME/brain\"     # Your knowledge base (NOT in this repo)\n```\n\nClaude Code:\n\n```bash\ncommand claude plugin marketplace add nicsuzor/aops-dist\ncommand claude plugin marketplace update aops && command claude plugin install aops-core@aops && command claude plugin list\n```\n\nGemini CLI:\n\n```bash\n(command gemini extensions uninstall aops-core || echo not installed) && command gemini extensions install git@github.com:nicsuzor/aops-dist.git --consent --auto-update --pre-release\n```\n\n## Project configuration\n\nProjects customise the framework by adding files to a `.agent/` directory:\n\n- **`.agent/rules/`** - Project-specific rules loaded automatically as binding constraints\n- **`.agent/workflows/`** - Project-specific workflows supplementing the global index\n- **`.agent/context-map.json`** - Maps project documentation to topics for just-in-time context injection\n"
