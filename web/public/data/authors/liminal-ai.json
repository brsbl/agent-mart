        "README.md": "# Liminal Spec\n\nA spec-driven development methodology for AI-assisted coding. Designed for features with detailed requirements, complex integrations, or multi-agent coordination.\n\nLiminal Spec runs a phased pipeline where each phase produces an artifact the next phase reads cold — no shared conversation history, no accumulated assumptions. The traceability chain (requirement → test condition → test → code) means when tests go green, you have high confidence the implementation matches the spec.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- New features with multiple components or integration points\n- Complex business logic where requirements need precision\n- Multi-agent builds where context isolation matters\n\nNot for: quick bug fixes, single-file changes, spikes, or emergency patches. Liminal Spec either runs full or not at all.\n\n## Phases\n\n| Phase | In | Out |\n|-------|-----|------|\n| 1. Product Research (optional) | Vision/idea | PRD |\n| 2. Feature Specification | PRD or requirements | Feature Spec |\n| 3. Tech Design | Feature Spec | Tech Design |\n| 4. Story Sharding | Spec + Design | Stories + Prompt Packs |\n| 5. Execution | Prompts | Verified code |\n\nMost work starts at Phase 2 - if you know what you're building, start there.\n\nWithin Phase 5, each story follows: **Skeleton → TDD Red → TDD Green → Gorilla Test → Verify**.\n\n## Key Ideas\n\n**Context isolation.** \"Agents\" means fresh context with artifact handoff — not roleplay personas. Each phase gets a clean context window. The artifact (document) is the complete handoff.\n\n**Confidence chain.** Every line of code traces back: AC (requirement) → TC (test condition) → Test → Implementation.\n\n**Upstream scrutiny.** The feature spec gets the most review because errors there cascade through every downstream phase.\n\n**Multi-model validation.** Different models catch different things. Artifacts are validated by their downstream consumer and by a different model for diverse perspective.\n\n**Prompt contract.** In Phase 4/5, prompt packs are context-rich task packets with explicit references to required artifacts (story, epic, tech design). Execution assumes agents read both the prompt and the referenced artifacts.\n\n## Installation\n\n### As a Claude Code Plugin (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add liminal-ai/liminal-spec\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install liminal-spec@liminal-plugins\n```\n\nThis gives you:\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/liminal-spec` | Router — presents the phase menu, routes to the right skill |\n| `/ls-research` | Phase 1 (optional) — product research and PRD drafting |\n| `/ls-epic` | Phase 2 — write a Feature Specification |\n| `/ls-tech-design` | Phase 3 — create a Tech Design from a Feature Spec |\n| `/ls-story` | Phase 4 — shard into stories and generate prompt packs |\n| `/ls-impl` | Phase 5 — execute stories with TDD and verification |\n\n`ls-` command prefixes are intentional: they make slash-command autocomplete clearer and avoid collisions with generic command names like `/epic` or `/story`.\n\nThe plugin also includes a **senior-engineer agent** for TDD implementation — rigorous TypeScript development with quality gates (format, lint, typecheck, test).\n\nStart with `/liminal-spec` and it will guide you to the right phase.\n\n### Distribution Formats\n\n| Format | Audience | Install/use mode | Contents |\n|--------|----------|------------------|----------|\n| Claude Code Plugin | Engineers, Tech Leads | `claude plugin install liminal-spec@liminal-plugins` | Router command, `ls-*` phase skills, senior-engineer agent |\n| Standalone `.md` files | BA, PO, PM, non-plugin users | Download release artifact, paste into chat | One self-contained skill per file |\n| `.skill` files | Users who want installable individual phase packs | Download release artifact and install selected skill | Packaged single-skill distributions |\n\n### For non-Claude-Code users (BA/PO/PM)\n\nDownload standalone files from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/liminal-ai/liminal-spec/releases). Each file is self-contained and can be pasted directly into Claude Enterprise Chat or any AI assistant.\n\n| File | For | Use when |\n|------|-----|----------|\n| `product-research-skill.md` | PO, PM, BA | Exploring direction and drafting a PRD |\n| `epic-skill.md` | BA, PO | Writing feature specifications |\n| `technical-design-skill.md` | Senior Dev, Tech Lead | Creating tech designs from a spec |\n| `story-sharding-skill.md` | Tech Lead, Engineers | Breaking features into stories and prompts |\n| `implementation-skill.md` | Engineers | Executing stories with TDD |\n\n### Troubleshooting: Marketplace Config Corruption (`source.source: Invalid input`)\n\nIf Claude Code fails at startup with an error like:\n\n```\nMarketplace configuration file is corrupted: liminal-plugins.source.source: Invalid input\n```\n\nyou likely have an older marketplace source enum (`\"dir\"`) in your local Claude config. Newer Claude Code expects `\"directory\"`.\n\nFix it by updating `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`, then restart Claude Code:\n\n```bash\njq 'with_entries(\n  if .key == \"liminal-plugins\" and .value.source.source == \"dir\"\n  then .value.source.source = \"directory\"\n  else .\n  end\n)' ~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json > /tmp/known_marketplaces.fixed.json \\\n  && mv /tmp/known_marketplaces.fixed.json ~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json\n```\n\nThen refresh/install again:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace update liminal-plugins\nclaude plugin install liminal-spec@liminal-plugins\n```\n\n## Execution SOP (Story Phases)\n\nFor story execution (`/ls-story` + `/ls-impl`), the standard flow is:\n1. Run `skeleton-red` prompt.\n2. Run required post-Red self-review follow-up prompt (same implementation session).\n3. Run `tdd-green` prompt.\n4. Run required post-Green self-review follow-up prompt (same implementation session).\n5. Run Gorilla testing (human) and then dual verification.\n\nThese two self-review checkpoints are now part of normal orchestration, not optional extras.\n\n### From source (for development)\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/liminal-ai/liminal-spec.git\ncd liminal-spec\nbun install\nbun run build\nclaude --plugin-dir ./dist/plugin\n```\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\nbun install\nbun run build       # Compose source into dist/\nbun run validate    # Validate output\nbun test            # Run tests\nbun run verify      # Build + validate + test\nbun run check       # Build + validate\n```\n\n`bun run verify` is the primary local quality gate before commit/push.\n\nEdit content in `src/`, never in `dist/`. The build composes phase content with shared references per the manifest and outputs a Claude Code plugin (`dist/plugin/`) and standalone markdown files (`dist/standalone/`). See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidance.\n\n## Versioning and Release Tracking\n\nLiminal Spec uses one release version across plugin + marketplace + artifacts (not per-skill versioning).\n\nTracked version fields:\n- `version.txt`\n- `manifest.json`\n- `package.json`\n- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`plugins[0].version`)\n\nRelease flow:\n1. Bump version in all tracked fields.\n2. Run `bun run verify`.\n3. Merge/push to `main` and wait for CI.\n4. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push tag to trigger release artifact publishing.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n  phases/          — Phase-specific content (one per skill)\n  shared/          — Cross-cutting concepts used by multiple phases\n  templates/       — Artifact templates\n  examples/        — Verification prompt templates\n  commands/        — /liminal-spec router command\n  agents/          — senior-engineer agent\nscripts/\n  build.ts         — Compose src/ into dist/\n  validate.ts      — Validate build output\nmanifest.json      — Maps which shared files each phase skill needs\ndocs/              — Long-form reference material and supporting notes\nplugins/           — Committed marketplace-installable plugin directories\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Releases](https://github.com/liminal-ai/liminal-spec/releases)\n- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n- [Development Guide](CLAUDE.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
