        "README.md": "# Ralph - Autonomous Software Development Plugin\n\nRalph is a Claude Code plugin that implements Geoffrey Huntley's [\"Ralph Wiggum as a software engineer\"](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) technique for autonomous software development using fresh context per iteration.\n\n## What is Ralph?\n\nRalph is inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's insight that you can achieve autonomous software development by giving an AI agent:\n\n1. **Fresh context every iteration** - No memory between work cycles\n2. **One task at a time** - Single focus prevents scope creep\n3. **Simple, repeatable process** - 9 steps executed consistently\n4. **Trust in eventual consistency** - Multiple simple iterations beat one complex attempt\n\nThe name \"Ralph Wiggum\" (from The Simpsons) represents this philosophy: simple, focused, consistent execution without overthinking. Ralph doesn't need to remember the big picture - he just needs clear instructions for the current task.\n\n## Phase 1 vs Phase 2\n\n**Phase 1 (This Implementation): Interactive Mode**\n\nThis is a Claude Code plugin using native agent features:\n- Skills orchestrate the iteration loop from the main session\n- Ralph-worker agent executes tasks with Sonnet 4.5\n- Ralph-oracle agent provides deep reasoning with Opus 4.5 + extended thinking\n- User interaction at 10-iteration checkpoints\n- Full integration with Claude Code's tool ecosystem\n\n**Phase 2 (Future): Full Autonomy**\n\nFuture standalone CLI tool with:\n- Background loops running independently\n- Cross-session state management\n- No human intervention required\n- Persistent daemon mode\n\nPhase 1 provides immediate value while validating the core technique. Phase 2 will scale it to true autonomy.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add stavarengo/ralph-wiggum-loop\n\n# Install Ralph\n/plugin install ralph@ralph-marketplace\n\n# Initialize in your project\n/ralph:init\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Initialize Ralph in your project\n/ralph:init\n\n# 2. Customize the templates (optional)\n# Edit docs/ai/ralph/PROMPT.md - Ralph's iteration instructions\n# Edit docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md - Your build/test commands\n# Edit docs/ai/ralph/fix_plan.md - Your task list\n\n# 3. Start autonomous development\n/ralph:start\n\n# Ralph will now:\n# - Pick tasks from fix_plan.md (highest priority first)\n# - Implement, test, document, commit each task\n# - Continue until complete or you stop it\n\n# 4. Stop when needed\n/ralph:stop\n```\n\n## Skills Reference\n\nRalph provides 5 skills for different stages of autonomous development:\n\n### `/ralph:init` - Initialize Ralph\n\nSets up Ralph in your project by creating the directory structure and copying templates.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Creates `docs/ai/ralph/` directory\n- Copies 3 templates: `PROMPT.md`, `fix_plan.md`, `AGENTS.md`\n- Creates `CLAUDE.md` symlink for auto-loading context\n- Initializes `status.json` for iteration tracking\n- Updates `.gitignore` to exclude Ralph's working directory\n\n**After initialization, your project will have:**\n```\nyour-project/\n├── docs/ai/ralph/\n│   ├── PROMPT.md      # Ralph's iteration instructions\n│   ├── fix_plan.md    # Task list and priorities\n│   ├── AGENTS.md      # Build/test instructions + learnings\n│   └── status.json    # Iteration tracking\n├── CLAUDE.md          # Symlink → docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md\n└── .gitignore         # Updated to exclude docs/ai/ralph/\n```\n\n**Next steps:**\n1. Edit `fix_plan.md` to add your tasks (in priority order)\n2. Edit `AGENTS.md` to add your build/test commands\n3. Run `/ralph:start` to begin autonomous development\n\n### `/ralph:start` - Start Autonomous Loop\n\nBegins the autonomous iteration loop that runs continuously until all tasks are complete.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Validates prerequisites (PROMPT.md, fix_plan.md, status.json exist)\n- Clears any existing stop signal\n- Updates status to 'running'\n- Enters main loop:\n  - Spawns ralph-worker for one iteration\n  - Checks for completion signals (RALPH_COMPLETE, RALPH_BLOCKED)\n  - Checks for stop signal (.ralph_stop)\n  - Prompts user every 10 iterations for confirmation\n  - Continues until complete/blocked/stopped\n\n**Example output:**\n```\nRalph started. Beginning autonomous iteration loop...\n\n=========================================\nStarting iteration 1\n=========================================\nIteration 1: Implemented user authentication\n- Files changed: src/auth.ts, tests/auth.test.ts\n- Tests: PASS (all 12 tests passing)\n- Next: Add password reset flow\n\n=========================================\nStarting iteration 2\n=========================================\nIteration 2: Implemented password reset flow\n- Files changed: src/reset.ts, tests/reset.test.ts\n- Tests: PASS (all 15 tests passing)\n- Next: RALPH_COMPLETE\n\nRALPH_COMPLETE signal detected. All tasks complete!\n\nRalph completed successfully!\n- Total iterations: 2\n- Status: complete\n- All tasks in fix_plan.md have been completed.\n```\n\n**Stop conditions:**\n- RALPH_COMPLETE signal in fix_plan.md (all tasks done)\n- RALPH_BLOCKED signal in fix_plan.md (cannot proceed)\n- `/ralph:stop` called by user\n- User declines continuation at 10-iteration checkpoint\n\n### `/ralph:iterate` - Single Iteration\n\nExecutes exactly ONE iteration manually for debugging or careful stepping.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Validates prerequisites\n- Spawns one ralph-worker\n- Displays result\n- Exits (no loop)\n\n**Use this when:**\n- Debugging Ralph's behavior\n- Testing changes to PROMPT.md or fix_plan.md\n- You want fine-grained control over iterations\n- Working through complex tasks with manual oversight\n\n**Example usage:**\n```\nUser: /ralph:iterate\n\nIteration 3 complete.\n\nSummary from ralph-worker:\n- Implemented database migration system\n- Files changed: src/migrations/, tests/migrations.test.ts\n- Tests: PASS (all 18 tests passing)\n- Next: Add user roles and permissions\n\nTo continue:\n- Run /ralph:iterate again for the next iteration\n- Run /ralph:start to begin autonomous looping\n```\n\n**Difference from `/ralph:start`:**\n\n| Feature | /ralph:iterate | /ralph:start |\n|---------|---------------|--------------|\n| Iterations | ONE | Continuous loop |\n| Control | Manual | Autonomous |\n| Use case | Debugging, stepping | Production development |\n| Stops after | 1 iteration | All tasks complete or /ralph:stop |\n\n### `/ralph:stop` - Stop Gracefully\n\nStops the autonomous loop gracefully, allowing the current iteration to finish.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Creates `.ralph_stop` signal file\n- Updates status.json to 'stopped'\n- Informs user that stop is pending\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Current iteration completes normally\n- No new iterations are spawned\n- Status updated to 'stopped'\n- Can resume later with `/ralph:start` or single-step with `/ralph:iterate`\n\n**Example:**\n```\nUser: /ralph:stop\n\nRalph has been signaled to stop.\n\n- The current iteration (if running) will finish naturally\n- No new iterations will be spawned\n- Status updated to 'stopped'\n\nYou can resume later with /ralph:start or run a single iteration with /ralph:iterate.\n```\n\n### `/ralph:reset` - Hard Reset Repository\n\nHard resets the repository to the last commit, discarding all uncommitted changes.\n\n**WARNING: This is destructive!**\n- Discards all uncommitted changes in tracked files\n- Removes all untracked files and directories\n- Resets to HEAD (last commit)\n- Cannot be undone\n\n**What it does:**\n- Prompts for confirmation with AskUserQuestion\n- Executes `git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -fd`\n- Updates status.json to 'reset'\n- Reports results to user\n\n**Use this when:**\n- Ralph is stuck in an iteration loop\n- The codebase is in an inconsistent state\n- You want to return to the last committed checkpoint\n- Tests are failing due to leftover artifacts\n\n**Example:**\n```\nUser: /ralph:reset\n\n⚠️  WARNING: This will discard ALL uncommitted changes and untracked files.\nThis cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to proceed? (yes/no)\n\nUser: yes\n\n✅ Repository reset complete\n- All uncommitted changes discarded\n- All untracked files removed\n- Repository at: abc1234\n- Status updated to: reset\n```\n\n## Workflow: Init → Customize → Start\n\nThe recommended workflow for using Ralph:\n\n### 1. Initialize\n```\n/ralph:init\n```\n\n### 2. Customize Templates\n\n**Edit `docs/ai/ralph/fix_plan.md`:**\n```markdown\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Add user authentication\n- [ ] Add password reset flow\n- [ ] Implement user roles\n- [ ] Add audit logging\n```\n\n**Edit `docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md`:**\n```markdown\n## How to Build\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## How to Test\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n```\n\n**Optionally edit `docs/ai/ralph/PROMPT.md`:**\nAdd project-specific instructions, adjust workflow, customize behavior.\n\n### 3. Start Autonomous Development\n```\n/ralph:start\n```\n\nRalph will now work through your task list autonomously, committing progress after each task.\n\n### 4. Monitor and Control\n\n**Check progress:**\n- Each iteration summary is displayed in chat\n- View `docs/ai/ralph/fix_plan.md` to see completed tasks\n- View `docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md` to see learnings accumulated\n\n**Intervene if needed:**\n- `/ralph:stop` - Stop gracefully\n- `/ralph:iterate` - Step through one iteration manually\n- `/ralph:reset` - Hard reset if stuck\n\n**Resume:**\n- `/ralph:start` - Resume autonomous loop\n\n## Agents\n\nRalph uses two agents with different roles:\n\n### ralph-worker (Sonnet 4.5)\n\n**Role:** Executes one task per iteration with fresh context\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5\n- Tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Task\n- bypassPermissions: true (autonomous operation)\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Starts each iteration with zero memory\n- Reads context files: PROMPT.md, fix_plan.md, AGENTS.md, status.json\n- Follows 9-step process: choose task → search → implement → test → document → update tracking → commit → tag → signal completion\n- Returns concise summary to main session\n\n**9-Step Process:**\n1. Choose highest priority task from fix_plan.md\n2. Search codebase with Glob/Grep to understand patterns\n3. Implement solution (no placeholders, complete code only)\n4. Test using commands from AGENTS.md\n5. Document learnings in AGENTS.md\n6. Update fix_plan.md (move task to Completed)\n7. Commit with conventional commit message\n8. Tag clean checkpoints (incremental versioning: 0.0.1, 0.0.2, ...)\n9. Signal completion (RALPH_COMPLETE) or continue to next task\n\n### ralph-oracle (Opus 4.5 + Extended Thinking)\n\n**Role:** Provides deep reasoning for complex decisions\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Model: Claude Opus 4.5\n- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob (read-only)\n- extendedThinking: true (ultrathink mode)\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Spawned by ralph-worker only when needed\n- Read-only access (cannot modify files)\n- Uses extended thinking for deep analysis\n- Returns structured recommendations\n\n**When consulted:**\n- Architecture decisions (which pattern to use)\n- Priority conflicts (which task first)\n- Debugging complex failures (root cause analysis)\n- Validation before major refactoring\n\n**Recommendation format:**\n```\n## Analysis\n[What was analyzed]\n\n## Recommendation\n[Clear, specific recommendation]\n\n## Rationale\n- Why this approach\n- Trade-offs\n- Risks to watch for\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n1. First step\n2. Second step\n...\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n[Other options and why not recommended]\n```\n\n**Decision-making principles:**\n1. Simplicity over complexity\n2. Consistency with existing patterns\n3. Completeness (no placeholders)\n4. Eventual consistency (multiple simple iterations)\n5. Fail forward (easy recovery)\n\n## Safety Mechanisms\n\nRalph is designed with multiple safety layers:\n\n### 1. Fresh Context Per Iteration\n- Each iteration starts with zero memory\n- Prevents context drift and hallucination accumulation\n- Forces explicit knowledge capture in files\n- Ensures reproducibility\n\n### 2. bypassPermissions Mode\n- ralph-worker runs with autonomous permissions\n- No prompts for file operations or git commands\n- Enables true autonomous operation\n- Controlled environment (can be stopped with /ralph:stop)\n\n### 3. User Checkpoints\n- Prompts user every 10 iterations for continuation\n- Prevents runaway loops\n- Gives user regular control points\n- Can decline to stop loop\n\n### 4. Graceful Stop Signal\n- `/ralph:stop` uses signal file (.ralph_stop)\n- Current iteration finishes normally\n- Clean shutdown, no abrupt termination\n- Can resume with `/ralph:start`\n\n### 5. One Task Per Iteration\n- Single focus prevents scope creep\n- Clear boundaries for each iteration\n- Easy to review changes (one task = one commit)\n- Reduces complexity\n\n### 6. Automatic Commits\n- Every completed task gets committed\n- Provides rollback points\n- Git history shows clear progress\n- Can reset with `/ralph:reset` if needed\n\n### 7. Oracle Consultation\n- Complex decisions get Opus 4.5 + extended thinking\n- Prevents worker from guessing on critical choices\n- Read-only oracle cannot make changes\n- Recommendations are explicit and traceable\n\n### 8. Completion Signals\n- RALPH_COMPLETE when all tasks done\n- RALPH_BLOCKED when cannot proceed\n- Clear exit conditions prevent infinite loops\n- User knows when intervention needed\n\n## Templates\n\nRalph uses 3 templates copied to your project during initialization:\n\n### PROMPT.md - Iteration Instructions\n\nContains the 9-step process and core principles. Ralph reads this at the start of each iteration.\n\n**Key sections:**\n- Core Principles (fresh context, one task, eventual consistency)\n- Context Loading (which files to read)\n- Oracle Consultation (when and how to spawn oracle)\n- 9-Step Iteration Process (detailed workflow)\n- Return Format (how to summarize iteration)\n- Failure Handling (what to do when stuck)\n\n**Customization:**\nAdd project-specific instructions, adjust priorities, modify workflow.\n\n### fix_plan.md - Task Tracking\n\nThe task list that drives Ralph's work. Tasks ordered by priority (top = highest).\n\n**Sections:**\n- **Tasks:** Pending work in priority order (markdown checkboxes)\n- **Completed:** Finished tasks with timestamps\n- **Blocked/Issues:** Tasks that cannot proceed with blocker descriptions\n\n**Signals:**\n- `RALPH_COMPLETE` at top = all tasks done\n- `RALPH_BLOCKED: [reason]` = cannot proceed, needs user intervention\n\n**Usage:**\nRalph moves tasks between sections after each iteration. You can edit this file anytime to add/remove/reprioritize tasks.\n\n### AGENTS.md - Build/Test Instructions\n\nContains build commands, test commands, and accumulated learnings.\n\n**Sections:**\n- **How to Build:** Commands to build the project (npm install, make build, etc.)\n- **How to Test:** Commands to run tests (npm test, pytest, etc.)\n- **Learnings:** Discoveries from iterations (patterns, gotchas, useful context)\n\n**Special note:**\nThis file is symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` in your project root, so Claude Code automatically reads it when starting any conversation in the project.\n\n**Updates:**\nRalph appends learnings after each iteration. Build/test commands can be updated as needed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Ralph won't start\n\n**Error: \"PROMPT.md not found\"**\n- Run `/ralph:init` first to initialize the project\n\n**Error: \"fix_plan.md is empty\"**\n- Add at least one task to the Tasks section in `docs/ai/ralph/fix_plan.md`\n\n### Ralph is stuck or looping\n\n**Same error repeated:**\n1. Run `/ralph:stop` to stop the loop\n2. Check `docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md` learnings for clues\n3. Fix the issue manually or update fix_plan.md to skip the problematic task\n4. Run `/ralph:reset` if the codebase is in a bad state\n5. Resume with `/ralph:start` or single-step with `/ralph:iterate`\n\n**Not making progress:**\n- Check fix_plan.md for RALPH_BLOCKED signal\n- Review the blocker description\n- Resolve the blocker or adjust task priorities\n- Resume with `/ralph:start`\n\n### Tests keep failing\n\n**Build/test commands wrong:**\n1. Edit `docs/ai/ralph/AGENTS.md`\n2. Update the \"How to Build\" and \"How to Test\" sections with correct commands\n3. Ralph will read the updated commands on next iteration\n\n**Environment issues:**\n- Ralph runs in the same environment as Claude Code\n- Check that dependencies are installed\n- Verify git config (user.name, user.email) is set\n- Ensure database/services are running if needed\n\n### Commits have wrong author\n\n**Git config not set:**\n```bash\ngit config user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n```\n\nRalph uses your git config for commits. The co-author line is added automatically:\n```\nCo-Authored-By: Ralph Wiggum <ralph@claude-code>\n```\n\n### Want to change iteration behavior\n\n**Customize PROMPT.md:**\n1. Edit `docs/ai/ralph/PROMPT.md`\n2. Modify the 9-step process, add project-specific rules, adjust priorities\n3. Ralph will read the updated instructions on next iteration\n\n**Examples:**\n- Add \"always run linter before commit\" to Step 7\n- Change \"spawn oracle for architecture decisions\" threshold\n- Add \"update documentation\" as additional step\n\n### Oracle not being consulted\n\n**Ralph is being too conservative:**\n- Edit `docs/ai/ralph/PROMPT.md`\n- Update the \"Oracle Consultation\" section to be more explicit about when to consult\n- Example: \"Always consult oracle before choosing between multiple architectural patterns\"\n\n**Oracle consultation is working correctly:**\n- Ralph only spawns oracle for genuinely complex decisions\n- Routine implementation work doesn't need oracle (keeps iterations fast)\n- If you want oracle consultation, make the decision criteria explicit in PROMPT.md\n\n### Performance is slow\n\n**Large codebase:**\n- Ralph uses Grep/Glob which are optimized for large codebases\n- Iterations may take longer for complex tasks\n- This is expected - quality over speed\n\n**Network latency:**\n- Ralph makes API calls for each agent spawn\n- Network issues can slow iterations\n- No workaround - inherent to the architecture\n\n**Spawning too many subagents:**\n- Check PROMPT.md for parallel search instructions\n- Default is \"up to 100 subagents for large searches\"\n- Reduce this if needed (though typically not a problem)\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### Can I use Ralph on existing projects?\n\nYes. Run `/ralph:init` in any project directory. Ralph will create `docs/ai/ralph/` and you can start immediately.\n\n### Does Ralph work with any programming language?\n\nYes. Ralph is language-agnostic. Just update `AGENTS.md` with your build/test commands.\n\n### Can I interrupt Ralph mid-iteration?\n\nUse `/ralph:stop`. The current iteration will finish, then the loop stops. You can also manually stop the Claude Code session, but this is less clean.\n\n### Will Ralph commit sensitive files?\n\nNo, if you have a proper `.gitignore`. Ralph respects git's ignore rules. Also, Ralph's working directory (`docs/ai/ralph/`) is excluded from commits.\n\n### Can I review commits before they're made?\n\nNot in Phase 1 (interactive mode). Ralph commits automatically after each task. Review the commits in git history afterward. If you want review before commit, use `/ralph:iterate` for manual stepping.\n\n### How do I resume after stopping?\n\nJust run `/ralph:start` again. Ralph reads the current state from status.json and fix_plan.md, then continues where it left off.\n\n### Can I use Ralph with multiple projects simultaneously?\n\nYes, each project has its own `docs/ai/ralph/` directory with independent state.\n\n### What if I want to change the task list mid-run?\n\nEdit `docs/ai/ralph/fix_plan.md` directly. Ralph reads it fresh at the start of each iteration, so changes take effect immediately.\n\n## References\n\n- **Original Article:** [Ralph Wiggum as a Software Engineer](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) by Geoffrey Huntley\n- **Design Document:** [docs/ai/ralph/backlog/2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode/2026-02-03.plan.brainstorm-design.ralph-plugin.md](/home/rfst/.claude/docs/ai/ralph/backlog/2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode/2026-02-03.plan.brainstorm-design.ralph-plugin.md)\n- **PRD:** [docs/ai/ralph/backlog/2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode/prd.2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode.md](/home/rfst/.claude/docs/ai/ralph/backlog/2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode/prd.2026-02-03.ralph-plugin-interactive-mode.md)\n\n## Credits\n\nRalph is an implementation of Geoffrey Huntley's autonomous development technique, built as a Claude Code plugin.\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Plugin: Ralph for Claude Code (Phase 1)\n- Authors: Built using Claude Sonnet 4.5\n- Inspiration: Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum technique\n\n**What's Next:**\n- Phase 2: Standalone CLI with full autonomy\n- Background loops running independently\n- Cross-session state management\n- True \"set and forget\" autonomous development\n\n## License\n\nSee LICENSE file in the plugin directory.\n"
