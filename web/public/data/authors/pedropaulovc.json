        "plugins/superpowers/README.md": "# Superpowers\n\nSuperpowers is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable \"skills\" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.\n\n## How it works\n\nIt starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. \n\nOnce it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. \n\nAfter you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. \n\nNext up, once you say \"go\", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\n\nThere's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.\n\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nIf Superpowers has helped you do stuff that makes money and you are so inclined, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring my opensource work](https://github.com/sponsors/obra).\n\nThanks! \n\n- Jesse\n\n\n## Installation\n\n**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.\n\n### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)\n\nIn Claude Code, register the marketplace first:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from this marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nCheck that commands appear:\n\n```bash\n/help\n```\n\n```\n# Should see:\n# /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement\n# /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan\n```\n\n### Codex\n\nTell Codex:\n\n```\nFetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md\n```\n\n**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)\n\n### OpenCode\n\nTell OpenCode:\n\n```\nFetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md\n```\n\n**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)\n\n## The Basic Workflow\n\n1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.\n\n2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.\n\n3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.\n\n4. **subagent-driven-development** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality).\n\n5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.\n\n6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.\n\n**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### Skills Library\n\n**Testing**\n- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle (includes testing anti-patterns reference)\n\n**Debugging**\n- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)\n- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed\n\n**Collaboration** \n- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement\n- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans\n- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Concurrent subagent workflows\n- **requesting-code-review** - Pre-review checklist\n- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback\n- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches\n- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)\n\n**Meta**\n- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)\n- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always\n- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing\n- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal\n- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success\n\nRead more: [Superpowers for Claude Code](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSkills live directly in this repository.

        "plugins/playwright-cli/README.md": "# playwright-cli\n\nPlaywright CLI with SKILLS\n\n### Playwright CLI vs Playwright MCP\n\nThis package provides CLI interface into Playwright. If you are using **coding agents**, that is the best fit.\n\n- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.\n\n- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns. Learn more about [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Token-efficient**. Does not force page data into LLM.\n\n### Requirements\n- Node.js 18 or newer\n- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other coding agent.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest\nplaywright-cli --help\n```\n\n> Note that you might need to force it to reclaim `playwright-cli` binary from our older MCP package.\n> ```bash\n> npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest --force\n> ```\n\n## Demo\n\n```\n> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.\n  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios. \n```\n\nYour agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:\n\n```\nplaywright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed\nplaywright-cli type \"Buy groceries\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli type \"Water flowers\"\nplaywright-cli press Enter\nplaywright-cli check e21\nplaywright-cli check e35\nplaywright-cli screenshot\n```\n\n### Skills-less operation\n\nPoint your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `playwright-cli --help` on its own:\n\n```\nTest the \"add todo\" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.\nCheck playwright-cli --help for available commands.\n```\n\n### Installing skills\n\nClaude Code, GitHub copilot and others will let you install the Playwright skills into the agentic loop.\n\n#### plugin (recommended)\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add microsoft/playwright-cli\n/plugin install playwright-cli\n```\n\n#### manual\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/playwright-cli\ncurl -o .claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/playwright-cli/main/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md\n```\n\n## Headed operation\n\nPlaywright CLI is headless by default. If you'd like to see the browser, pass `--headed` to `open`:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev --headed\n```\n\n## Sessions\n\nPlaywright CLI will use a dedicated persistent profile by default. It means that\nyour cookies and other storage state will be preserved between the calls. You can use different\ninstances of the browser for different projects with sessions.\n\nFollowing will result in two browsers with separate profiles being available. Pass `--session` to\nthe invocation to talk to a specific browser.\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://playwright.dev\nplaywright-cli --session=example open https://example.com\nplaywright-cli session-list\n```\n\nYou can run your coding agent with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nPLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo-app claude .\n```\n\nOr instruct it to prepend `--session` to the calls.\n\nManage your sessions as follows:\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli session-list             # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-stop [name]      # stop session\nplaywright-cli session-stop-all         # stop all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-delete [name]    # delete session data along with the profiles\n```\n\n<!-- BEGIN GENERATED CLI HELP -->\n\n## Commands\n\n### Core\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open [url]               # open url\nplaywright-cli close                    # close the page\nplaywright-cli type <text>              # type text into editable element\nplaywright-cli click <ref> [button]     # perform click on a web page\nplaywright-cli dblclick <ref> [button]  # perform double click on a web page\nplaywright-cli fill <ref> <text>        # fill text into editable element\nplaywright-cli drag <startRef> <endRef> # perform drag and drop between two elements\nplaywright-cli hover <ref>              # hover over element on page\nplaywright-cli select <ref> <val>       # select an option in a dropdown\nplaywright-cli upload <file>            # upload one or multiple files\nplaywright-cli check <ref>              # check a checkbox or radio button\nplaywright-cli uncheck <ref>            # uncheck a checkbox or radio button\nplaywright-cli snapshot                 # capture page snapshot to obtain element ref\nplaywright-cli eval <func> [ref]        # evaluate javascript expression on page or element\nplaywright-cli dialog-accept [prompt]   # accept a dialog\nplaywright-cli dialog-dismiss           # dismiss a dialog\nplaywright-cli resize <w> <h>           # resize the browser window\n```\n\n### Navigation\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli go-back                  # go back to the previous page\nplaywright-cli go-forward               # go forward to the next page\nplaywright-cli reload                   # reload the current page\n```\n\n### Keyboard\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli press <key>              # press a key on the keyboard, `a`, `arrowleft`\nplaywright-cli keydown <key>            # press a key down on the keyboard\nplaywright-cli keyup <key>              # press a key up on the keyboard\n```\n\n### Mouse\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli mousemove <x> <y>        # move mouse to a given position\nplaywright-cli mousedown [button]       # press mouse down\nplaywright-cli mouseup [button]         # press mouse up\nplaywright-cli mousewheel <dx> <dy>     # scroll mouse wheel\n```\n\n### Save as\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli screenshot [ref]         # screenshot of the current page or element\nplaywright-cli pdf                      # save page as pdf\n```\n\n### Tabs\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli tab-list                 # list all tabs\nplaywright-cli tab-new [url]            # create a new tab\nplaywright-cli tab-close [index]        # close a browser tab\nplaywright-cli tab-select <index>       # select a browser tab\n```\n\n### DevTools\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli console [min-level]      # list console messages\nplaywright-cli run-code <code>          # run playwright code snippet\nplaywright-cli network                  # list all network requests since loading the page\nplaywright-cli tracing-start            # start trace recording\nplaywright-cli tracing-stop             # stop trace recording\nplaywright-cli video-start              # start video recording\nplaywright-cli video-stop               # stop video recording\n```\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli install                  # install browser\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli config                   # restart session with new config, defaults to `playwright-cli.json`\n```\n\n### Sessions\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli session-list             # list all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-stop [name]      # stop session\nplaywright-cli session-restart [name]   # restart session\nplaywright-cli session-stop-all         # stop all sessions\nplaywright-cli session-delete [name]    # delete session data\n<!-- END GENERATED CLI HELP -->\n\n## Configuration file\n\nThe Playwright CLI can be configured using a JSON configuration file.
