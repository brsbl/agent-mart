Based on a 5-minute cognitive assessment, Claude adapts its formatting, structure, vocabulary, and presentation style to match how your brain processes information best.\n\nIn studies with thousands of users, personalised AI outputs led to **up to 30% better understanding**.\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the Cowork Plugin Marketplace (recommended)\n\nOnce listed: Plugins sidebar → search \"Skyglide\" → install\n\n### From GitHub\n\nAdd this repo as a marketplace source, then install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add deejrushton/skyglide-cowork-plugin\n/plugin install skyglide@skyglide-plugins\n```\n\n### From URL\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/deejrushton/skyglide-cowork-plugin\n/plugin install skyglide@skyglide-plugins\n```\n\n### Manual upload (for testing)\n\nDownload the latest release ZIP and upload via Plugins → Upload plugin in Cowork.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installing:\n\n1. **Say \"set up Skyglide\"** — Claude will walk you through the setup\n2. **Complete the brain games** at [skyglide.ai](https://skyglide.ai?utm_source=cowork&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=skyglide_cowork_v1) (free, ~5 minutes)\n3. **Paste your profile** — copy from your results page and paste it into Cowork\n4. **Restart Claude Desktop** — so the profile loads into new conversations\n\nThat's it. From that point on, every response Claude gives you is personalised.\n\n## How It Works\n\nSee the [plugin README](skyglide/README.md) for full details on architecture, updating, and troubleshooting.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```\nskyglide-cowork-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json        # Marketplace directory listing\n├── skyglide/                   # The plugin\n│   ├── .claude-plugin/\n│   │   └── plugin.json         # Plugin manifest\n│   ├── skills/\n│   │   ├── setup/\n│   │   │   └── SKILL.md        # Setup and update flow\n│   │   └── uninstall/\n│   │       └── SKILL.md        # Clean removal from CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── .mcp.json               # Empty (no external connections)\n│   └── README.md               # Plugin documentation\n├── LICENSE                     # Apache 2.0\n└── README.md                   # This file\n```\n\n## Privacy & Security\n\n- **Local only** — your profile is stored on your machine as markdown.

        "skyglide/README.md": "# Skyglide — Personalised AI for Cowork\n\nSkyglide personalises how Claude communicates with you. Based on a 5-minute cognitive assessment, Claude adapts its formatting, structure, vocabulary, and presentation style to match how your brain processes information best.\n\nIn studies with thousands of users, personalised AI outputs led to **up to 30% better understanding**.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **Install the plugin** — from the Cowork plugin marketplace, or add the GitHub repo as a marketplace source\n2. **Say \"set up Skyglide\"** — Claude will walk you through the setup\n3. **Complete the brain games** at [skyglide.ai](https://skyglide.ai?utm_source=cowork&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=skyglide_cowork_v1) (free, ~5 minutes)\n4. **Paste your profile** — copy from your results page and paste it into Cowork\n5. **Restart Claude Desktop** — so the profile loads into new conversations\n\nThat's it. From that point on, every response Claude gives you is personalised.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Two Skills\n\nThe plugin has two skills:\n\n- **setup** — triggered when you say \"set up Skyglide\", \"update my Skyglide profile\", or paste a profile. Writes your full profile into CLAUDE.md.\n- **uninstall** — triggered when you say \"remove Skyglide\" or \"uninstall Skyglide\". Removes the profile block from CLAUDE.md, since uninstalling the plugin alone won't clean it up.\n\nPersonalisation doesn't need a skill. Your profile lives in CLAUDE.md, which Claude reads automatically on every message. No invocation required.\n\n### Where Your Profile Lives\n\nYour Skyglide profile is embedded **directly in CLAUDE.md** between `<!-- SKYGLIDE:START -->` and `<!-- SKYGLIDE:END -->` markers. This follows the same pattern used by Anthropic's own productivity plugin for persistent memory.\n\nCLAUDE.md is loaded into every Cowork conversation automatically — it's the only truly always-on mechanism.\n\nThis means:\n- It loads automatically in every Cowork session\n- It works across all projects and working directories\n- It persists between sessions (after restarting Claude Desktop)\n- It coexists with other CLAUDE.md content (memory management, other plugins)\n- You can inspect or edit it at any time\n\n### Using in Claude.ai Chat\n\nThe setup flow can also create a **Custom Style** for Claude.ai chat. Styles are the only truly always-on mechanism in the chat interface. Set your Skyglide style as default and it applies to every conversation automatically.\n\n### Updating Your Profile\n\nIf you play new Skyglide games or want to refresh your profile:\n1. Visit [skyglide.ai](https://skyglide.ai?utm_source=cowork&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=skyglide_cowork_v1)\n2. Copy your updated profile\n3. Say \"update my Skyglide profile\" in Cowork\n4. Paste the new version\n\nThe setup skill will surgically replace just the Skyglide block in CLAUDE.md, preserving everything else.\n\n## Privacy & Security\n\n- **Local only** — your profile is stored on your machine as a markdown file. No data is sent to external servers.\n- **No MCP servers** — this plugin has no external connections.\n- **No diagnostic labels** — the profile contains formatting preferences, not clinical assessments.\n- **Open source** — inspect every file. The plugin is markdown and JSON, nothing compiled.\n- **You control it** — say \"uninstall Skyglide\" or manually remove the Skyglide block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` at any time.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\nskyglide/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest\n├── skills/\n│   ├── setup/\n│   │   └── SKILL.md          # Setup and update flow\n│   └── uninstall/\n│       └── SKILL.md          # Clean removal from CLAUDE.md\n├── .mcp.json                 # Empty (no external connections)\n└── README.md                 # This file\n```\n\nSee the [repo-level README](../README.md) for the full repository structure and installation instructions.\n\n## Installation Methods\n\n### From Marketplace (recommended)\nOnce approved: Plugins sidebar → search \"Skyglide\" → install\n\n### From GitHub\n```\n/plugin marketplace add deejrushton/skyglide-cowork-plugin\n/plugin install skyglide@skyglide-plugins\n```\n\n### Manual (for testing)\nUpload the plugin ZIP via Plugins → Upload plugin\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Desktop for macOS or Windows\n- Paid Claude subscription (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)\n- A free account at [skyglide.ai](https://skyglide.ai?utm_source=cowork&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=skyglide_cowork_v1)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Profile not applying?** Check that `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` contains a `<!-- SKYGLIDE:START -->` block. If not, say \"set up Skyglide\" to re-run setup. Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after initial setup.\n\n**Skills not triggering?** This is a known Cowork platform issue on Windows affecting all plugins (including Anthropic's own). It doesn't matter for day-to-day use — your profile lives in CLAUDE.md, not in a skill. The setup skill only needs to work once, and Claude can fall back to reading the skill file manually.\n\n**Want to start fresh?** Say \"uninstall Skyglide\" to remove your profile from CLAUDE.md, then say \"set up Skyglide\" to start over. If you've already uninstalled the plugin, you can manually remove the block between `<!-- SKYGLIDE:START -->` and `<!-- SKYGLIDE:END -->` from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n## Learn More\n\n- [skyglide.ai](https://skyglide.ai?utm_source=cowork&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=skyglide_cowork_v1) — Take the assessment\n- [Cowork Plugin Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) — Plugin development reference\n- [Agent Skills Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — How skills work\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE)\n"
