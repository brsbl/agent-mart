Regular analysis and refinement\n- **Evidence-Based** - Concrete data and examples over assumptions\n- **Structured Output** - Well-organized, easy to navigate documentation\n\n## Output Format\n\nSkills create structured outputs in designated folders:\n\n```\n.research/\n└── topic-name-2026-01-26.md          # Research reports\n\n.tasks/\n├── skill-refactoring-name-2026-01-26/ # Refactoring reports\n└── skill-upgrade-name-2026-01-26/     # Upgrade reports\n\nskills/\n└── new-skill-name/                    # New skills\n    ├── SKILL.md\n    └── references/\n\nAGENTS.md                              # Agent configurations\nCLAUDE.md\n.cursor/rules/*.mdc\n```\n\nEach output includes:\n- Structured documentation with clear sections\n- Analysis and synthesis (not just raw data)\n- Practical, actionable recommendations\n- Evidence and sources for all claims\n- Quality verification results\n\n## Skill Workflows\n\n### Independent Usage\n\nAll skills can be used independently:\n- **general-research:** Anytime you need information from internet\n- **general-skill-maker:** Create new skills from scratch\n- **general-skill-refiner:** Review any existing skill\n- **general-skill-upgrader:** Enhance existing skills functionally\n- **agentmd-creator:** Generate agent configuration files\n\n### Complementary Usage\n\nSkills work together in powerful workflows:\n\n**Complete Skill Development Cycle:**\n1. Research best practices (general-research)\n2. Create skill (general-skill-maker)\n3. Refine quality (general-skill-refiner)\n4. Upgrade features (general-skill-upgrader)\n5. Repeat 3-4 for continuous improvement\n\n**Agent Configuration Workflow:**\n1. Research domain best practices (general-research)\n2. Create agent config (agentmd-creator)\n3. Test and gather feedback\n4. Research improvements if needed\n5. Update config based on findings\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThese skills operate on the principle that **quality compounds**. High-quality inputs lead to high-quality outputs. Quality isn't achieved once - it requires continuous attention and improvement through:\n\n- **Systematic methodologies** over improvised approaches\n- **Evidence-based decisions** with multi-source verification\n- **Progressive disclosure** of information at the right level\n- **Structured frameworks** ensuring nothing important is missed\n- **Continuous refinement** through regular analysis and improvement\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is a public repository for generic agent skills.
