Challenge assumptions, expose blind spots, and think clearly about reality before you build.\n\n## What are Critical Briefs?\n\nCritical Briefs use **challenging, skeptical dialogue** to create structured documents that help users:\n- Validate business ideas by exposing weaknesses and testing assumptions\n- Stress-test operational processes to find blind spots and failure points\n- Design focused MVPs by ruthlessly cutting scope and challenging complexity\n- Think clearly about reality instead of optimistic scenarios\n\nThese skills are **skeptical by design** - they find problems, ask tough questions, demand evidence, and cut ruthlessly. Think of them as experienced mentors who've seen failures and want to prevent them.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### 🏢 critical-business-brief\nTransforms vague business ideas into structured, reality-tested business briefs through critical dialogue. Systematically explores problem, customer, solution, business model, competition, and more. Challenges assumptions and demands evidence.\n\n**Use when:**\n- User presents an unclear or early-stage business idea\n- Mentions starting a business or business opportunity\n- Needs to validate assumptions about a concept\n- Asks to clarify or validate a business opportunity\n\n**Output:** Structured business brief in `.ideas/[idea-name]/business.md`\n\n### ⚙️ critical-process-brief\nMaps out and stress-tests operational processes to expose hidden complexity, bottlenecks, and scalability issues. Probes step-by-step flows, edge cases, failure points, and scale scenarios (2x, 10x, 100x).\n\n**Use when:**\n- User wants to map out business processes or operations\n- Needs to think through \"how this works operationally\"\n- Questions about delivery, workflows, or process details\n- Needs to validate operational feasibility\n\n**Output:** Detailed process brief in `.ideas/[idea-name]/process.md`\n\n### 📱 critical-app-brief\nDesigns focused MVP applications through ruthless scope-cutting dialogue. Challenges every feature, pushes for simpler tech, and keeps laser focus on building minimum viable product to test core hypotheses.\n\n**Use when:**\n- User wants to turn business ideas and processes into an application\n- Mentions \"build an app\", \"MVP\", or application design\n- Needs help defining what to build and what to cut\n- Ready to design application after clarifying business and processes\n\n**Output:** MVP application brief in `.ideas/[idea-name]/app.md`\n\n## Installation\n\n### In Claude Code\n\n1. **Register the marketplace:**\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add Przemocny/critical-briefs\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the plugin:**\n   ```bash\n   /plugin install critical-briefs@critical-briefs\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the skills** by mentioning them in conversation:\n   - \"I have a business idea...\" (triggers critical-business-brief)\n   - \"How would this work operationally?\" (triggers critical-process-brief)\n   - \"Let's build an MVP for this\" (triggers critical-app-brief)\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nClone the repository and copy skills to your local `~/.claude/skills/` directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Przemocny/critical-briefs.git\ncd critical-briefs\ncp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nAll three skills follow a similar workflow:\n\n1. **Initial Understanding** - Open questions to understand the concept\n2. **Critical Exploration** - Systematic questioning across key categories\n3. **Brief Creation** - Structured documentation with marked uncertainties\n4. **Wrap-up** - Honest assessment and next steps\n\n### Key Principles\n\n- **Critical, not supportive** - Challenge assumptions, find weaknesses, cut ruthlessly\n- **Reality over optimism** - Point out difficulties and obstacles\n- **Natural dialogue** - Conversational flow, not rigid questionnaire\n- **Evidence-based** - Push for concrete evidence, not assumptions\n- **Structured output** - Map conversations to actionable briefs\n\n## Output Format\n\nSkills create structured briefs in `.ideas/[idea-name]/`:\n\n```\n.ideas/\n└── my-business-idea/\n    ├── business.md    # Business concept validation (critical-business-brief)\n    ├── process.md     # Operational process analysis (critical-process-brief)\n    └── app.md         # MVP application design (critical-app-brief)\n```\n\nEach skill includes:\n- **Reference materials** in `references/` subdirectory:\n  - `categories-guide.md` - Detailed explanation of each category\n  - `questions-library.md` - Critical questions library\n  - `red-flags.md` - Common warning signs and problems\n\nEach brief includes:\n- Detailed exploration of key categories\n- **Uncertainties** marked explicitly\n- **Red flags** identified clearly\n- **Critical challenges** prioritized\n- **Next steps** for validation/action\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThese skills operate on the principle that **finding problems early is a gift**. It's better to discover fatal flaws in conversation than after months of work. The skills are designed to be:\n\n- **Skeptical** - Assume issues exist until proven otherwise\n- **Direct** - Point out contradictions and problems clearly\n- **Realistic** - Provide context from common failures\n- **Honest** - No sugarcoating of serious problems\n- **Ruthless** - Default to cutting scope, challenging complexity, demanding evidence\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is a public repository for critical brief skills. Contributions are welcome for:\n- Additional critical brief skills (product brief, marketing brief, financial brief, etc.)\n- Additional critic skills (code review, architecture review, security review, etc.)\n- Improvements to existing skills\n- Additional reference materials (questions, red flags, categories)\n- Bug fixes and clarifications\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 (for skill implementations)\n\n## Related\n\n- [Anthropic Skills Repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io)\n- [CampusAI](https://campus.ai)\n"
