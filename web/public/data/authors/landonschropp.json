It's primarily composed of skills, which are implemented following the [Agent\nSkills](https://agentskills.io/) specification. It also contains reusable documentation which is\nintended to be referenced in `AGENTS.md` files.\n\nThe toolkit is customized to my personal workflow, and isn't meant to be used by anyone else,\nalthough others are welcome to use it if they'd like.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nTo use this toolkit with Claude Code, first add the marketplace provided by this plugin.\n\n```sh\nclaude plugin marketplace add ./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n```\n\nThen, you can install the `ls` plugin normally.\n\n```sh\nclaude plugin install ls\n```\n"
