It's primarily composed of skills, which are implemented following the [Agent\nSkills](https://agentskills.io/) specification. It also contains reusable documentation which is\nintended to be referenced in `AGENTS.md` files.\n\nThe toolkit is customized to my personal workflow, and isn't meant to be used by anyone else,\nalthough others are welcome to use it if they'd like.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nTo use this toolkit with Claude Code, simply install it as a plugin.\n\nTODO: Add instructions for installing as a plugin.\n\n## Environment\n\nEnvironment variables that may be referenced:\n\n- `WRITING_FORMAT`: Markdown formatting conventions (not included in this repository as it outlines my unique writing style).\n- `PLANS_DIRECTORY`: Relative path to a directory for storing plan files.\n"
