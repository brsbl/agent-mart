I used and iterated on spectrl ***every single day***.\n\nThese are the *actual* prompts I use non stop every day.\n\nWith spectrl, I built an React Native based AI Agent + GPS Rangefinder for Golfers (New June (in Alpha)) and a 250k line Tauri/Rust/React desktop application called Subspace (in open Beta).\n\nspectrl made products like New June and Subspace possible.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace and install\n/plugin marketplace add Codename-Inc/spectrl\n/plugin install spectrl@codename\n```\n\nThen start building:\n\n```plaintext\n/spectrl:scope \n```\n\nThat's it. You just start with 1 command to build features.\n\n## The spectrl Workflow\n\nIf you start with /scope, your agent will guide you through the rest of the steps automatically.\n\n| Phase | Command | What It Does |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **S**cope | `/spectrl:scope` | Define requirements, constraints, success criteria |\n| **P**lan | `/spectrl:plan` | Research codebase, create implementation plan |\n| **E**xecute | `/spectrl:execute` | Parallel implementation with wave-based delivery |\n| **C**lean | `/spectrl:clean` | Remove dead code, lint, format |\n| **T**est | `/spectrl:test` | Risk-aware test coverage |\n| **R**ebase | `/spectrl:rebase` | Safe merge preparation with conflict handling |\n| **E**valuate | `/spectrl:evaluate` | Document changes + architecture review |\n\nEach command ends with \"Next Steps\" suggestions, so you always know what prompt to run next — you don’t have to remember what the prompts are, which is one thing that kills me about many other Spec Driven Development workflows.\n\nYou can use *any* of the commands in any sequence you want - they are good standalone too. More on my typical daily usage below.\n\n## spectrl Session Memory\n\nspectrl can maintain and accumulates context across sessions when you use the /spectrl:handoff command. To get the most from spectrl's Session Memory, we recommend that you:\n\n1. turn off auto-compact in Claude Code /config settings, and\n\n2. run /spectrl:handoff liberally when you are switching gears or the context window is getting north of 160k tokens.\n\n### How It Works\n\nWhen you run /spectrl:handoff, a status report will get generated for that session, and automatically loaded into your context window for the next session. You’ll see a nice summary of the status when you run /clear.\n\nIf you already had previous sessions, a subagent (spectrl:sync) will review the last 3 status updates and merge into a single continuous session memory.\n\nVoila -- trailing 3 session memory snapshots.\n\nIf you want to start fresh — /spectrl:forget archives the session_logs.\n\n```plaintext\n/spectrl:handoff   # Save progress before session ends\n/spectrl:forget    # Clear memory for fresh start\n```\n\n## Subagents\n\nspectrl dispatches specialized subagents for different tasks:\n\nNOTE: You don’t even need to know that these subagents exist. The prompts instruct Claude Code to call them automatically.\n\nAlthough I do sometimes use @spectrl:researcher for web research. Its like mini deep-research.\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| `@spectrl:dev` | Implementation with MVP focus |\n| `@spectrl:analyst` | Understand how code works |\n| `@spectrl:finder` | Find where code lives |\n| `@spectrl:patterns` | Find reusable patterns |\n| `@spectrl:web-research` | Web research |\n| `@spectrl:tester` | Test automation |\n| `@spectrl:reviewer` | Independent code review |\n\n## How I Typically use spectrl\n\n99.9% of my day is spent using spectrl exactly like this.\n\n- start /spectrl:scope to get crisp on what’s in/out. this is non-negotiable unless the feature is a one line ask.\n\n- /spectrl:plan to build out a well researched technical design or set of tasks\n\n  - once i have scope/plan/tasks, I typically run /spectrl:handoff to get a fresh context window with awareness of what we’re working on.\n\n- then run /spectrl:execute to use parallel subagents to work through the tasks. Execute is a meta prompt that also calls /spectrl:code_review and /spectrl:validate.\n\n  - side note /spectrl:validate is a killer prompt. It breaks down the original tasks and dispatches subagents to verify. find stuff missing all the time with this.\n  - when initial execution is complete, i run another /spectrl:handoff to get the context window clean for fixes/touch ups\n\n- From here — I do a bunch off manual testing and fixing.\n\n  - I largely use Claude Code's built in /plan mode for fixes in this phase.\n\n  - If there is a bug that can't easily be solved, i use the /spectrl:fix prompt for a more strutured debugging approach.\n\n  - If something new comes up, or if the scope is not what I’d hoped, I run a new /scope cycle from within the project.\n\n- During the process of manual testing/fixing, I typically accumulate uncommitted changes. /spectrl:sweep will get your changes committed, while \n\n  - running and addressing lint\n  - running tests and related tests on touched files\n  - finding obvious dead code/AI slop, and\n  - grouping changes logically with descriptive conventional commits \n\n- Once wrapping up, /spectrl:clean is a much deeper cleanup that disptaches subagents to find dead code, duplicates, verifies, lint, commits any stragglers, etc.\n\n- Then /spectrl:test does deep analysis and dispatches subagents to write tests based on a risk-adjusted framework focusing on behavior not implementation details.\n\n- Once cleaned/tested — /spectrl:rebase works great to rebase onto your parent branch, but obviously you do you with your release flow. \n\n- Finally before I get fully checked in, I run /spectrl:evaluate. Its a good way to document the work that you can later easily reference with an @, and the architecture review is helpful to think through if what you built ultimately needs some future work. Nothing ever goes as planned after all.\n\nNote: I'm hard at work on a major upgrade to the /evaluate prompt, so watch for that. Hint: recursive learning.\n\n## Slash Command Reference\n\n### Core Workflow\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/spectrl:scope` | Interactive feature scoping |\n| `/spectrl:plan` | Research codebase, create implementation plan |\n| `/spectrl:execute` | Wave-based parallel execution with code review |\n| `/spectrl:clean` | Code cleanup and quality gates |\n| `/spectrl:test` | Risk-aware test coverage |\n| `/spectrl:rebase` | Safe rebase with conflict handling |\n| `/spectrl:evaluate` | Documentation and architecture review |\n\n### Quick Start\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/spectrl:quick_dev` | Scope + plan for small/medium tasks |\n\n### Discovery & Research\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/spectrl:kickoff` | Deep research for high-ambiguity features |\n| `/spectrl:research` | Parallel codebase research |\n\n### Session Memory\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/spectrl:handoff` | Save session state snapshot |\n| `/spectrl:forget` | Clear memory, archive logs |\n\n### Utilities\n\nThese are situational commands.\n\nI use /spectrl:fix for pretty much all bugs I run into.\n\n| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/spectrl:sweep` | Light cleanup pass — lint, test, descriptive commits |\n| `/spectrl:ux_spec` | UX specification for UI-heavy features |\n| `/spectrl:fix` | Investigate bugs & implement fixes |\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n```plaintext\nspectrl/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json  # Marketplace registration\n├── plugins/\n│   └── spectrl/\n│       ├── .claude-plugin/\n│       │   └── plugin.json   # Plugin manifest\n│       ├── commands/         # Slash commands\n│       ├── agents/           # Subagent definitions\n│       ├── hooks/            # Session memory hooks\n│       └── skills/           # Skills\n├── scripts/              # Release & utility scripts\n└── CLAUDE.md\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT"
