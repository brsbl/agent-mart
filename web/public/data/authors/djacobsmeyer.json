This skill reads a plan file, follows its instructions step-by-step, and reports the completed work.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A plan file in markdown format (typically from `/quick-plan` skill)\n- The plan contains clear implementation steps\n- You have access to the files that need to be modified\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Validate plan** - Confirm a plan file path has been provided\n2. **Analyze plan** - Read the plan and understand all implementation requirements\n3. **Implement** - Execute each step of the plan, modifying code as needed\n4. **Report** - Summarize changes and show diff statistics\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. If no plan file path is provided, ask the user to provide it and stop\n2. Read the plan file thoroughly - understand the full scope of work\n3. Think deeply about the implementation approach before starting\n4. Execute the plan step-by-step:\n   - Create new files as specified\n   - Modify existing files as outlined\n   - Follow code patterns and conventions from the plan\n5. After implementation, report:\n   - Summary of completed work (bullet points)\n   - Files changed with `git diff --stat`\n\n## Examples\n\n**Example 1: Building from a plan**\n```\nUser: /build specs/authentication-system.md\nClaude: [Reads authentication-system.md plan]\n[Implements all steps]\nSummary:\n- Created JWT middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts\n- Added login endpoint to src/routes/auth.ts\n- Added password hashing utilities\n[Shows git diff --stat output]\n```\n\n**Example 2: Implementing a feature plan**\n```\nUser: Build the payment integration from specs/stripe-integration.md\nClaude: [Reads plan and implements stripe integration]\nSummary:\n- Integrated Stripe API client\n- Created payment endpoints\n- Added webhooks for payment events\n```\n",

Useful for understanding project layout, documenting folder organization, or visualizing file hierarchies.\n\n## Features\n\n- Display directory trees with visual formatting\n- Support for custom paths via slash command\n- Ignore common build/dependency directories by default\n- Multiple output formats (text tree, indented, etc.)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- No special dependencies required\n- Works with any directory on the system\n- The slash command `/tree` provides convenient path-based access\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Basic Usage: Current Working Directory\n\nWhen you need to see the structure of the current working directory, use the Bash tool with the `tree` command:\n\n```bash\ntree -L 3 -a\n```\n\nThis displays up to 3 levels of the directory structure with all files (including hidden ones).\n\n### Advanced Usage: Custom Path via /tree Command\n\nUse the custom slash command `/tree` with a file path argument to view any directory:\n\n```\n/tree /path/to/directory\n```\n\nThe slash command accepts optional arguments:\n- Path (required): The directory to visualize\n- Depth (optional): Number of levels to display (default: 3)\n\n### Tree Command Options\n\nCommon options when using the `tree` command directly:\n\n- `-L N`: Limit depth to N levels\n- `-a`: Show all files including hidden ones\n- `-I 'pattern'`: Ignore files matching pattern\n- `-d`: Directories only\n- `-h`: Human-readable file sizes\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: View Plugin Directory Structure\n\nDisplay the structure of the current plugins directory:\n\n```bash\ntree -L 2 plugins/\n```\n\nOutput shows all plugins and their first-level contents.\n\n### Example 2: Use /tree Command with Custom Path\n\nAsk Claude to show the structure of a specific directory:\n\n> \"Show me the structure of the src directory\"\n\nClaude will invoke: `/tree src`\n\n### Example 3: Deep Directory Exploration\n\nExplore nested structures with multiple levels:\n\n```bash\ntree -L 5 -I 'node_modules|.git|dist'\n```\n\nThis shows up to 5 levels while excluding common dependency/build directories.\n\n### Example 4: File-Only Tree\n\nDisplay only files without directories:\n\n```bash\ntree -f --dirsfirst\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Tree command not available**: The `tree` command may not be installed on all systems. Use `ls -R` as a fallback:\n\n```bash\nls -R /path/to/directory\n```\n\n**Too much output**: Reduce depth with `-L 2` or filter with `-I 'pattern'`\n\n**Permission denied**: Some directories may require elevated permissions. Use `ls -la` instead.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Using Bash for file exploration](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/tools)\n- [Glob patterns for file matching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/tools)\n",

This enables running multiple instances of the observability system simultaneously without port conflicts, database collisions, or hook misconfiguration.\n\n## Variables\n\n```\nPROJECT_CWD: . (current working directory - the main project root)\nBRANCH_NAME: $1 (required)\nPORT_OFFSET: $2 (optional, defaults to auto-calculated based on existing worktrees, starts at 1)\nWORKTREE_BASE_DIR: trees/\nWORKTREE_DIR: trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\nSERVER_BASE_PORT: 4000\nCLIENT_BASE_PORT: 5173\nSERVER_PORT: 4000 + (PORT_OFFSET * 10)  # First worktree: 4010, Second: 4020, etc.\nCLIENT_PORT: 5173 + (PORT_OFFSET * 10)  # First worktree: 5183, Second: 5193, etc.\nOPEN_BROWSER_WHEN_COMPLETE: false       # Set to true to auto-open browser after setup\n\nNOTE: Main repo uses ports 4000 and 5173 (no offset)\n      Worktrees start at offset 1 to avoid conflicts with main repo\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\n- This is a ONE-SHOT command that creates AND starts a worktree automatically\n- Creates a fully functional, isolated clone of the codebase in a separate worktree\n- Each worktree runs on unique ports to prevent conflicts when running in parallel\n- Port offsets start at 1 and increment (1→4010/5183, 2→4020/5193, 3→4030/5203...)\n- Main repo preserves default ports 4000/5173 for primary development work\n- All environment configuration must be worktree-specific\n- Database files are isolated per worktree (each gets its own events.db)\n- Hook scripts will send events to the worktree's specific server instance\n- Dependencies are installed automatically for each worktree\n- After setup, the script automatically starts both server and client services\n- The start script kills any existing processes on the target ports before starting\n- Services run in the FOREGROUND - Ctrl+C stops both server and client\n- Validation ensures the worktree is ready before starting services\n- If branch doesn't exist locally, create it from current HEAD\n- If branch exists but isn't checked out, create worktree from it\n- Provide clear access URLs so user can immediately use the running instance\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Parse and Validate Arguments\n\n- Read BRANCH_NAME from $1, error if missing\n- Read PORT_OFFSET from $2 if provided\n- If PORT_OFFSET not provided, calculate next available offset:\n  - List all existing worktrees: `git worktree list`\n  - Check PROJECT_CWD/trees/ directory for existing worktrees\n  - Count existing worktrees and use (count + 1) as offset (1, 2, 3, 4...)\n  - IMPORTANT: Offset starts at 1 to preserve main repo ports (4000, 5173)\n  - First worktree gets offset 1 → ports 4010, 5183\n  - Second worktree gets offset 2 → ports 4020, 5193\n- Calculate SERVER_PORT and CLIENT_PORT using offset * 10\n- Validate branch name format (no spaces, valid git branch name)\n\n### 2. Pre-Creation Validation\n\n- Check if PROJECT_CWD/trees/ directory exists, create if not: `mkdir -p trees`\n- Verify trees/ is in PROJECT_CWD/.gitignore (should be there already)\n- Check if worktree already exists at WORKTREE_DIR\n- Check if branch exists: `git branch --list <BRANCH_NAME>`\n  - If branch doesn't exist, will create it in next step\n  - If branch exists, will checkout to create worktree\n- Check if calculated ports are available:\n  - Check SERVER_PORT: `lsof -i :SERVER_PORT` (should return nothing)\n  - Check CLIENT_PORT: `lsof -i :CLIENT_PORT` (should return nothing)\n  - If ports are in use, error with message to try different offset\n\n### 3. Create Git Worktree\n\n- From PROJECT_CWD, create worktree with: `git worktree add trees/<BRANCH_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>`\n  - If branch doesn't exist, this creates it from HEAD\n  - If branch exists, this checks it out in the worktree\n  - This creates WORKTREE_DIR at PROJECT_CWD/trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n- Verify worktree was created: `git worktree list | grep trees/<BRANCH_NAME>`\n- All subsequent operations will reference WORKTREE_DIR (which is PROJECT_CWD/trees/<BRANCH_NAME>)\n\n### 4. Setup Root Environment File\n\n- Check if root .env exists in main project at PROJECT_CWD/.env\n- If PROJECT_CWD/.env exists:\n  - Copy it to worktree root: `cp <PROJECT_CWD>/.env <WORKTREE_DIR>/.env`\n  - Note: This preserves API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)\n- If PROJECT_CWD/.env doesn't exist:\n  - Copy .env.sample if available: `cp <PROJECT_CWD>/.env.sample <WORKTREE_DIR>/.env`\n  - Add warning to report that user needs to configure API keys\n\n### 5. Setup Server Environment\n\n- Create WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/.env with SERVER_PORT and DB_PATH\n- File contents:\n  ```\n  SERVER_PORT=<calculated SERVER_PORT>\n  DB_PATH=events.db\n  ```\n- The DB_PATH is relative and will create events.db in WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/ directory\n- This ensures complete database isolation between worktrees\n\n### 6. Setup Client Environment\n\n- Create WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/.env with all client configuration\n- File contents:\n  ```\n  VITE_PORT=<calculated CLIENT_PORT>\n  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:<calculated SERVER_PORT>\n  VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:<calculated SERVER_PORT>/stream\n  VITE_MAX_EVENTS_TO_DISPLAY=100\n  OBSERVABILITY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:<calculated SERVER_PORT>/events\n  ```\n- The OBSERVABILITY_SERVER_URL is critical for hooks to send events to correct server\n\n### 7. Install Dependencies\n\n- Install server dependencies:\n  - `cd <WORKTREE_DIR>/apps/server && bun install`\n  - Verify WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/node_modules directory was created\n- Install client dependencies:\n  - `cd <WORKTREE_DIR>/apps/client && bun install`\n  - Verify WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/node_modules directory was created\n- Return to worktree root: `cd <WORKTREE_DIR>`\n\n### 8. Validation\n\n- Verify directory structure:\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR exists\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR/.env exists at root\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/.env exists\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/.env exists\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/node_modules exists\n  - Confirm WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/node_modules exists\n- List worktrees to confirm: `git worktree list`\n- Read back the created env files to confirm values are correct\n\n### 9. Start the Worktree Services\n\n- Change to worktree directory: `cd <WORKTREE_DIR>`\n- Start the system using the one-shot script in the BACKGROUND:\n  - Command: `cd <WORKTREE_DIR> && SERVER_PORT=<calculated SERVER_PORT> CLIENT_PORT=<calculated CLIENT_PORT> sh scripts/start-system.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &`\n  - This runs WORKTREE_DIR/scripts/start-system.sh in background, redirecting output to suppress it\n- The script will automatically:\n  - Kill any existing processes on those ports\n  - Start the server from WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server on the calculated port\n  - Start the client from WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client on the calculated port\n  - Wait for both services to be ready (health check)\n- Give services 3-5 seconds to start before reporting\n- Wait with: `sleep 5`\n- Verify services are running:\n  - Check server: `curl -s http://localhost:<SERVER_PORT>/events/filter-options >/dev/null 2>&1`\n  - Check client: `curl -s http://localhost:<CLIENT_PORT> >/dev/null 2>&1`\n- If health checks pass, services are confirmed running\n\n### 10. Open Dashboard in Chrome (Optional)\n\n- ONLY if OPEN_BROWSER_WHEN_COMPLETE is true:\n  - After services are confirmed running, open the dashboard in Chrome:\n    - Command: `open -a \"Google Chrome\" http://localhost:<CLIENT_PORT>`\n    - This automatically opens the worktree's dashboard in a new Chrome tab\n    - If Chrome is not available, fall back to default browser: `open http://localhost:<CLIENT_PORT>`\n  - Note: This happens in the background and doesn't block the report\n- If OPEN_BROWSER_WHEN_COMPLETE is false, skip this step entirely\n\n### 11. Report\n\nFollow the Report section format below to provide comprehensive setup information.\n\n## Report\n\nAfter successful worktree creation, validation, and startup, provide a detailed report in the following format:\n\n```\n✅ Git Worktree Created and Started Successfully!\n\n📁 Worktree Details:\n   Location: trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n   Branch: <BRANCH_NAME>\n   Status: 🟢 RUNNING\n\n🔌 Port Configuration:\n   Server Port: <SERVER_PORT>\n   Client Port: <CLIENT_PORT>\n   Port Offset: <PORT_OFFSET> (multiply by 10)\n\n🌐 Access URLs (LIVE NOW):\n   🖥️  Dashboard: http://localhost:<CLIENT_PORT>\n   🔌 Server API: http://localhost:<SERVER_PORT>\n   📡 WebSocket: ws://localhost:<SERVER_PORT>/stream\n\n📦 Dependencies:\n   ✓ Server dependencies installed (WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/node_modules)\n   ✓ Client dependencies installed (WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/node_modules)\n\n🗄️  Database:\n   Path: WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/events.db (isolated per worktree)\n\n⚙️  Environment Files:\n   ✓ Root .env (WORKTREE_DIR/.env with API keys)\n   ✓ Server .env (WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/.env with SERVER_PORT, DB_PATH)\n   ✓ Client .env (WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/.env with VITE_PORT, API URLs)\n\n🎯 Services Running:\n   ✓ Server started on port <SERVER_PORT> (background)\n   ✓ Client started on port <CLIENT_PORT> (background)\n   ✓ WebSocket streaming active\n   ✓ Ready to receive hook events\n\n📝 Important Notes:\n   • The services are running in the BACKGROUND\n   • Services auto-started and will continue running until manually stopped\n   • Open http://localhost:<CLIENT_PORT> in your browser NOW to view the dashboard\n   • This worktree is completely isolated from the main codebase\n   • You can run multiple worktrees simultaneously with different ports\n   • Check running processes: lsof -i :<SERVER_PORT> and lsof -i :<CLIENT_PORT>\n\n🔄 To Restart This Worktree Later:\n\n   cd trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n\n   # Kill existing processes first\n   lsof -ti :<SERVER_PORT> | xargs kill -9\n   lsof -ti :<CLIENT_PORT> | xargs kill -9\n\n   # Or use the one-shot script (it kills automatically)\n   SERVER_PORT=<SERVER_PORT> CLIENT_PORT=<CLIENT_PORT> sh scripts/start-system.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\n🧹 To Stop This Worktree:\n\n   # Option 1: Manual kill\n   lsof -ti :<SERVER_PORT> | xargs kill -9\n   lsof -ti :<CLIENT_PORT> | xargs kill -9\n\n   # Option 2: Use reset script (with environment variables)\n   cd trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n   SERVER_PORT=<SERVER_PORT> CLIENT_PORT=<CLIENT_PORT> ./scripts/reset-system.sh\n\n🗑️  To Remove This Worktree:\n\n   # Stop services first (see above)\n\n   # Then remove the worktree:\n   git worktree remove trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n\n   # Or force remove if needed:\n   git worktree remove trees/<BRANCH_NAME> --force\n\n🎉 Next Steps:\n   1.

This includes stopping any running services on its ports, cleaning up processes, removing the worktree directory, and permanently deleting the branch. This ensures complete cleanup without orphaned processes or files.\n\n## Variables\n\n```\nPROJECT_CWD: . (current working directory - the main project root)\nBRANCH_NAME: $1 (required)\nWORKTREE_DIR: trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\n- This command safely removes a worktree and all associated resources\n- Stops any running server and client processes for the worktree\n- Removes the git worktree using git's built-in removal command\n- Deletes the git branch associated with the worktree (PERMANENT)\n- Validates that the worktree and branch were completely removed\n- Provides clear feedback about what was removed and any issues encountered\n- If services can't be stopped gracefully, force kills them\n- Handles cases where worktree is already partially removed\n- WARNING: Both worktree and branch deletion are permanent and cannot be undone\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Parse and Validate Arguments\n\n- Read BRANCH_NAME from $1, error if missing\n- Construct WORKTREE_DIR path: `PROJECT_CWD/trees/<BRANCH_NAME>`\n- Validate branch name format (no spaces, valid git branch name)\n\n### 2. Check Worktree Existence\n\n- List all worktrees: `git worktree list`\n- Check if worktree exists at WORKTREE_DIR\n- If worktree doesn't exist:\n  - Check if directory exists anyway (orphaned directory)\n  - If directory exists, note it for manual cleanup\n  - If neither exists, error with message that worktree not found\n\n### 3. Identify Port Configuration\n\n- Check if WORKTREE_DIR/apps/server/.env exists\n- If exists, read SERVER_PORT from the file\n- Check if WORKTREE_DIR/apps/client/.env exists\n- If exists, read VITE_PORT from the file\n- If env files don't exist, try to infer ports from worktree count:\n  - Count existing worktrees in PROJECT_CWD/trees/\n  - Estimate ports based on typical offset pattern\n  - Note: This is best-effort if env files are missing\n\n### 4. Stop Running Services\n\n- If SERVER_PORT identified, stop processes on that port:\n  - Find PIDs: `lsof -ti :<SERVER_PORT>`\n  - Kill processes: `kill -9 <PIDs>`\n  - Verify processes stopped\n- If VITE_PORT identified, stop processes on that port:\n  - Find PIDs: `lsof -ti :<VITE_PORT>`\n  - Kill processes: `kill -9 <PIDs>`\n  - Verify processes stopped\n- Check for any remaining processes in WORKTREE_DIR:\n  - `ps aux | grep \"trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\"`\n  - Kill any orphaned processes\n- Wait 2 seconds for processes to fully terminate\n\n### 5. Remove Git Worktree\n\n- Remove worktree using git: `git worktree remove trees/<BRANCH_NAME>`\n- If removal fails with error (e.g., worktree has uncommitted changes):\n  - Try force removal: `git worktree remove trees/<BRANCH_NAME> --force`\n  - Note the force removal in the report\n- Verify worktree was removed: `git worktree list | grep trees/<BRANCH_NAME>`\n- Should return nothing if successfully removed\n\n### 6. Clean Up Orphaned Files\n\n- Check if WORKTREE_DIR still exists after git worktree remove\n- If directory still exists (shouldn't, but possible with force):\n  - Note this in warnings\n  - Do NOT automatically delete with rm -rf (security)\n  - Provide manual cleanup instructions\n- Check for any SQLite WAL files in the removed worktree location\n- Check for any lingering lock files\n\n### 7. Delete Git Branch\n\n- After worktree is successfully removed, delete the git branch:\n  - First try safe delete: `git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>`\n  - If safe delete fails (unmerged changes), use force delete: `git branch -D <BRANCH_NAME>`\n  - Note in report if force delete was used\n- Verify branch was deleted: `git branch --list <BRANCH_NAME>`\n- Should return nothing if successfully deleted\n- Important: This is destructive and permanent\n\n### 8. Validation\n\n- Confirm worktree no longer appears in: `git worktree list`\n- Confirm directory no longer exists at WORKTREE_DIR\n- Confirm branch no longer exists: `git branch --list <BRANCH_NAME>`\n- Confirm no processes running on identified ports\n- If any validation fails, include in warnings section\n\n### 9. Report\n\nFollow the Report section format below to provide comprehensive removal information.\n\n## Report\n\nAfter successful worktree removal, provide a detailed report in the following format:\n\n```\n✅ Git Worktree and Branch Removed Successfully!\n\n📁 Worktree Details:\n   Location: trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n   Branch: <BRANCH_NAME>\n   Status: ❌ REMOVED\n\n🛑 Services Stopped:\n   ✓ Server on port <SERVER_PORT> (if identified)\n   ✓ Client on port <VITE_PORT> (if identified)\n   ✓ All orphaned processes terminated\n\n🗑️  Cleanup:\n   ✓ Git worktree removed\n   ✓ Git branch deleted\n   ✓ Directory removed from trees/\n   ✓ No lingering processes\n\n📝 Important Notes:\n   • Both the worktree AND branch '<BRANCH_NAME>' have been deleted\n   • This removal is PERMANENT and cannot be undone\n   • If you need this branch again, create a new one with: /create_worktree <BRANCH_NAME>\n   • The new branch will start from your current HEAD\n\n🔍 Verification:\n   ✓ Worktree not in git worktree list\n   ✓ Branch not in git branch list\n   ✓ Directory trees/<BRANCH_NAME> removed\n   ✓ Ports <SERVER_PORT>, <VITE_PORT> are free\n```\n\nIf any issues occurred during removal, include a warnings section:\n\n```\n⚠️  Warnings / Issues:\n- Used --force flag to remove worktree (had uncommitted changes)\n- Used -D flag to force delete branch (had unmerged changes)\n- Port <PORT> could not be identified (no .env file found)\n- Processes manually killed: <PID1>, <PID2>\n```\n\nIf worktree was already partially removed or not found:\n\n```\n⚠️  Worktree Status:\n- Worktree 'trees/<BRANCH_NAME>' was not found in git worktree list\n- Directory may have been manually deleted\n- Run 'git worktree prune' to clean up worktree metadata\n\n📝 Cleanup Command:\n   git worktree prune\n```\n\nIf orphaned directory exists after removal:\n\n```\n⚠️  Manual Cleanup Required:\n- Directory trees/<BRANCH_NAME> still exists after git worktree remove\n- This should not happen normally\n- To manually remove, run from PROJECT_CWD:\n   rm -rf trees/<BRANCH_NAME>\n- Or use the reset script with port variables:\n   SERVER_PORT=<PORT> CLIENT_PORT=<PORT> ./scripts/reset-system.sh\n```\n",

Use when user mentions sandboxing, security isolation, untrusted code, network restrictions, filesystem permissions, or wants to configure Claude Code security settings. Helps enable/disable sandbox mode, configure permissions, troubleshoot compatibility issues, and provide scenario-based configurations.\nallowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep\n---\n\n# Sandbox Manager Skill\n\nHelps users configure and manage Claude Code's sandboxing feature for secure, isolated code execution.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code installed (Linux or macOS only - Windows not supported)\n- Understanding of your project's security requirements\n- Access to `.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`\n\n## When to Use Sandboxing\n\n**Enable sandboxing when:**\n- Working with untrusted or third-party code\n- Testing potentially dangerous scripts\n- Running unfamiliar repositories\n- Need to restrict network or filesystem access\n- Working in shared environments\n\n**Skip sandboxing when:**\n- Using tools incompatible with sandbox (docker, watchman)\n- Need full system access for legitimate reasons\n- Working with fully trusted code only\n- Performance is critical and trust is established\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Enable Sandbox Mode\n\nTo enable sandboxing for the current session:\n```bash\n/sandbox\n```\n\nThis activates with sensible defaults:\n- Read/write access to current working directory\n- Read-only access to rest of filesystem (except denied locations)\n- Network proxy requiring permission for new domains\n\n### 2. Configure Sandbox Settings\n\nEdit `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global):\n\n**Basic configuration:**\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"allowedDirectories\": [\n      \"/path/to/project\",\n      \"/path/to/data\"\n    ],\n    \"deniedDirectories\": [\n      \"/etc\",\n      \"/var\",\n      \"~/.ssh\",\n      \"~/.aws\"\n    ],\n    \"allowedDomains\": [\n      \"github.com\",\n      \"api.example.com\",\n      \"*.trusted-cdn.com\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Apply Scenario-Based Configuration\n\nChoose a configuration template based on your use case (see [Configuration Templates](docs/configuration-templates.md)):\n\n- **Web Development** - Allow npm registry, CDNs, common APIs\n- **Python Data Science** - Allow PyPI, data sources, Jupyter\n- **General Development** - Balanced permissions for most projects\n- **High Security** - Minimal permissions for untrusted code\n- **API Integration** - Specific API endpoints only\n\n### 4. Troubleshoot Compatibility Issues\n\n**Docker conflicts:**\n- Sandboxing and Docker don't work together\n- Either disable sandbox or use devcontainers instead\n- Use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in tool calls if necessary\n\n**Watchman conflicts:**\n- Watchman (used by some file watchers) incompatible with sandbox\n- Disable watchman or run without sandbox\n\n**Network restrictions:**\n- New domains trigger permission requests\n- Add known domains to `allowedDomains` in settings\n- Use wildcards for CDNs: `*.cloudfront.net`\n\n**Permission denied errors:**\n- Check if path is in `allowedDirectories`\n- Ensure path isn't in `deniedDirectories`\n- Use absolute paths in configuration\n\n### 5. Verify Sandbox Status\n\nCheck if sandbox is active:\n```bash\n# Sandbox shows status when enabled\n/sandbox\n```\n\nTest filesystem restrictions:\n```bash\n# Should succeed (working directory)\nls .\n\n# May require permission (outside working directory)\nls /usr/local\n```\n\nTest network restrictions:\n```bash\n# Should prompt for permission (new domain)\ncurl https://example.com\n```\n\n## Configuration Templates\n\n### Web Development Projects\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"allowedDirectories\": [\n      \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n      \"~/.npm\",\n      \"~/.nvm\",\n      \"/tmp\"\n    ],\n    \"allowedDomains\": [\n      \"registry.npmjs.org\",\n      \"*.npmjs.org\",\n      \"*.cloudflare.com\",\n      \"*.cloudfront.net\",\n      \"api.github.com\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Python Data Science\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"allowedDirectories\": [\n      \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n      \"~/.local/lib/python*\",\n      \"~/data\",\n      \"/tmp\"\n    ],\n    \"allowedDomains\": [\n      \"pypi.org\",\n      \"*.pypi.org\",\n      \"files.pythonhosted.org\",\n      \"*.anaconda.org\",\n      \"raw.githubusercontent.com\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### High Security (Untrusted Code)\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"allowedDirectories\": [\n      \"${workspaceFolder}/sandbox-only\"\n    ],\n    \"deniedDirectories\": [\n      \"~/.ssh\",\n      \"~/.aws\",\n      \"~/.config\",\n      \"/etc\",\n      \"/var\",\n      \"/usr\",\n      \"/System\"\n    ],\n    \"allowedDomains\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### API Integration Projects\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"allowedDirectories\": [\n      \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n      \"/tmp\"\n    ],\n    \"allowedDomains\": [\n      \"api.stripe.com\",\n      \"api.openai.com\",\n      \"*.your-api.com\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Limitations\n\n1. **OS Support:** Linux and macOS only (no Windows support)\n2. **Docker incompatibility:** Cannot use Docker commands while sandboxed\n3. **Tool compatibility:** Some tools (watchman) don't work in sandbox\n4. **Network filtering:** Blocks domains, but doesn't inspect traffic content\n5. **Performance:** Minimal overhead but present\n6. **Nested sandboxing:** Weaker protection in Docker environments (Linux)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Security\n- **Always deny sensitive directories:** `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`\n- **Use principle of least privilege:** Only allow necessary domains\n- **Review permission requests:** Don't auto-approve without understanding\n- **Test in sandbox first:** Before running untrusted code\n\n### Configuration\n- **Use wildcards carefully:** `*.cdn.com` is broad - be specific when possible\n- **Project-level settings:** Use `.claude/settings.json` for project-specific needs\n- **Global baseline:** Set strict defaults in `~/.claude/settings.json`\n- **Document exceptions:** Comment why certain permissions are needed\n\n### Workflow\n- **Enable for new repos:** Default to sandboxed when cloning unknown code\n- **Disable when needed:** Use escape hatch for trusted operations\n- **Check tool compatibility:** Verify your stack works with sandbox before enabling\n- **Monitor permission requests:** Track what's being accessed\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n### \"Permission denied\" when accessing project files\n**Solution:** Add project directory to `allowedDirectories`:\n```json\n\"allowedDirectories\": [\"${workspaceFolder}\"]\n```\n\n### Network requests failing silently\n**Solution:** Check Claude Code output for permission prompts, or add domains:\n```json\n\"allowedDomains\": [\"api.example.com\"]\n```\n\n### Docker commands not working\n**Solution:** Sandboxing conflicts with Docker. Either:\n- Disable sandbox for this session\n- Use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in Bash tool calls\n- Use devcontainers instead\n\n### Package manager can't download dependencies\n**Solution:** Add package registry to allowed domains:\n```json\n\"allowedDomains\": [\n  \"registry.npmjs.org\",\n  \"pypi.org\",\n  \"rubygems.org\"\n]\n```\n\n### Tool runs outside sandbox unexpectedly\n**Solution:** Check if using escape hatch. Disable in settings:\n```json\n{\n  \"sandbox\": {\n    \"allowUnsandboxedCommands\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Enable sandbox for untrusted repository\n\n**User:** \"I cloned a repo from GitHub that I don't fully trust. Can you help me run it safely?\"\n\n**Response:**\n```\nI'll help you set up sandboxing for secure execution:\n\n1. First, let me enable sandbox mode:\n/sandbox\n\n2. I'll create a restricted configuration for this untrusted code:\n\n[Creates .claude/settings.json with high-security template]\n\n3. This configuration:\n   - Restricts filesystem access to this project only\n   - Blocks all network access by default\n   - Denies access to your credentials and config files\n\n4. When you run the code, you'll be prompted for any permission requests.\n   Review each carefully before approving.\n\nWould you like me to run the project's setup now, or would you like to\nreview the configuration first?\n```\n\n### Example 2: Configure sandbox for web development\n\n**User:** \"I need to work on a Next.js project. How do I set up sandboxing?\"\n\n**Response:**\n```\nI'll configure sandboxing optimized for Next.js development:\n\n[Edits .claude/settings.json with web development template including:]\n- npm registry access\n- Common CDN domains\n- Your project directory\n- node_modules and package cache locations\n\nThis allows:\n- npm install and package downloads\n- CDN resources for development\n- API calls to common services\n- Full access to your project files\n\nThe sandbox will still protect:\n- Your SSH keys and credentials\n- System configuration files\n- Other projects on your machine\n\nSandbox is now configured. Run /sandbox to enable it for this session.\n```\n\n### Example 3: Troubleshoot Docker conflict\n\n**User:** \"I enabled sandbox but now docker commands don't work\"\n\n**Response:**\n```\nDocker and Claude Code's sandbox mode are incompatible. You have three options:\n\n1. **Disable sandbox for this session** (if you trust the code):\n   Run commands without /sandbox enabled\n\n2. **Use selective unsandboxing** (for specific docker commands):\n   I can pass dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true for docker-specific operations\n\n3. **Use devcontainers instead** (recommended for untrusted code):\n   Set up a devcontainer which provides isolation + Docker access\n\nWhich approach fits your security needs?\n```\n\n### Example 4: Debug permission issues\n\n**User:** \"Sandbox keeps blocking my Python script from reading data files\"\n\n**Response:**\n```\nLet me help debug the permission issue:\n\n1. First, where are your data files located?\n[User provides: ~/datasets/]\n\n2. I see the issue - your data directory isn't in allowedDirectories.\nLet me update your settings:\n\n[Edits settings.json to add ~/datasets/ to allowedDirectories]\n\n3. The sandbox now allows:\n   - Read/write to your project directory\n   - Read/write to ~/datasets/\n   - Read-only to system libraries\n\nTry running your script again. If it still fails, check for:\n- Network requests (will need domain allowlist)\n- Writing to /tmp (can add if needed)\n- Other file locations being accessed\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\n- **Configuration Templates:** See [docs/configuration-templates.md](docs/configuration-templates.md)\n- **Official Docs:** https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing\n- **Security Best Practices:** https://code.claude.com/docs/en/security\n\n## Version\n\n1.0.0 - Initial release with configuration templates and troubleshooting guide\n",

Create database tables, API endpoints, custom functions, and business logic using XanoScript. Use when building backend APIs, database schemas, serverless functions, webhooks, or integrating with Xano workspace.\nallowed-tools: Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, AskUserQuestion\n---\n\n# Xano Backend Builder\n\nBuild serverless backend infrastructure using Xano's no-code platform through MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration. Create databases, REST APIs, custom functions, and business logic using XanoScript without traditional coding.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Xano Account and Workspace**:\n   - Sign up at https://xano.com\n   - Create or access an existing workspace\n\n2. **MCP Access Token and URL**:\n   - Navigate to workspace Settings → Metadata API & MCP Server\n   - Copy your **MCP Server URL** (e.g., `https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/mcp`)\n   - Generate an **Access Token** with appropriate scopes\n   - **CRITICAL**: Token appears only once - save it securely\n   - **WARNING**: MCP operations can modify/delete data - use backups for production\n\n3. **MCP Server Configuration**:\n   This plugin includes MCP server configuration that connects automatically when enabled.\n\n   **Set environment variables**:\n   ```bash\n   export XANO_MCP_URL=\"https://your-workspace.xano.io/mcp\"\n   export XANO_MCP_TOKEN=\"your_access_token_here\"\n   ```\n\n   Or add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`):\n   ```bash\n   # Xano MCP Configuration\n   export XANO_MCP_URL=\"https://your-workspace.xano.io/mcp\"\n   export XANO_MCP_TOKEN=\"your_access_token_here\"\n   ```\n\n   **Restart Claude Code** after setting environment variables.\n\n   The Xano MCP server will start automatically when this plugin is enabled, and Xano tools will be available in your Claude Code session.\n\n### Understanding Xano Architecture\n\n**Xano Components**:\n- **Database Tables**: Store structured data with relationships\n- **API Endpoints**: REST endpoints for CRUD operations and custom logic\n- **Function Stack**: Visual programming interface using XanoScript\n- **Background Tasks**: Scheduled or triggered async operations\n- **AI Agents**: Custom AI-powered functions and workflows\n\n**XanoScript Basics**:\nXano uses a proprietary syntax called XanoScript for defining logic. Key characteristics:\n- **Namespace functions**: `db.query`, `array.push`, `var.update`\n- **Variable assignment**: Use `as $variable_name`\n- **Filters**: Transform data with pipe syntax `|filter_name:option`\n- **Primitives**: Top-level constructs (API, function, table, etc.)\n\n**Important**: XanoScript syntax is unique to Xano. When working with XanoScript:\n- Look for examples in Xano documentation or API responses\n- Test syntax incrementally\n- Reference [docs/xanoscript-reference.md](docs/xanoscript-reference.md) for detailed syntax guide\n\n### Workflow\n\n1. **Understand the requirement**:\n   - What data needs to be stored? (database design)\n   - What API endpoints are needed? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n   - What business logic is required? (transformations, validations, external API calls)\n   - What integrations are needed? (webhooks, OAuth, third-party APIs)\n\n2. **Design the database schema**:\n   - Identify entities (tables) and relationships\n   - Define fields with appropriate data types\n   - Consider indexes for performance\n   - Use MCP tools to create tables:\n     ```\n     Use Xano MCP tools to create a table with specified fields\n     ```\n\n3. **Create API endpoints**:\n   - Define REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n   - Configure authentication requirements\n   - Set up input parameters and validation\n   - Build response structure\n   - Use MCP tools to create API endpoints\n\n4. **Implement business logic with XanoScript**:\n   - Use the Function Stack to build logic\n   - **Key XanoScript patterns**:\n     - Query database: `db.query table_name { filters } as $results`\n     - Create variable: `var $my_var { value = \"initial\" }`\n     - Update variable: `var.update $my_var { value = \"new\" }`\n     - Loop through data: `foreach ($items) { each as $item { } }`\n     - Conditional logic: `conditional { if ($condition) { } else { } }`\n     - Transform data: `$data|filter_name:option`\n   - Reference [docs/xanoscript-reference.md](docs/xanoscript-reference.md) for detailed syntax\n\n5. **Test the implementation**:\n   - Use Xano's built-in API testing interface\n   - Verify database operations\n   - Check response formats\n   - Test error handling\n   - Validate authentication flows\n\n6. **Generate API documentation**:\n   - Use MCP tools to generate OpenAPI specifications\n   - Share with frontend developers\n   - Document authentication requirements\n\n7. **Deploy and monitor**:\n   - Test in Xano's staging environment\n   - Deploy to production\n   - Monitor API usage and performance\n   - Set up error logging\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n**1. REST API for CRUD operations**:\n- Create database table\n- Generate default API endpoints\n- Add authentication\n- Customize response format\n\n**2. Webhook receiver**:\n- Create API endpoint to receive webhooks\n- Parse incoming payload\n- Process data (store, transform, forward)\n- Return appropriate response\n\n**3. External API integration**:\n- Create function to call external API\n- Handle authentication (API keys, OAuth)\n- Parse response and transform data\n- Store or return processed data\n\n**4. Data transformation pipeline**:\n- Query source data\n- Apply filters and transformations\n- Aggregate or format results\n- Return processed data\n\n**5. Scheduled background tasks**:\n- Create background task\n- Define schedule (cron-like)\n- Implement logic (cleanup, notifications, sync)\n- Handle errors and retries\n\n### XanoScript Guidelines\n\n**Be mindful of syntax differences**:\n- XanoScript is NOT JavaScript/Python\n- Function syntax: `namespace.function` (e.g., `db.query`, not `db_query`)\n- Variables always use `$` prefix: `$my_variable`\n- Assignment uses `as` keyword: `db.query users {} as $users`\n- Filters use pipe: `$users|count`, not `count($users)`\n\n**When uncertain about syntax**:\n1. Check [docs/xanoscript-reference.md](docs/xanoscript-reference.md) for examples\n2. Ask Xano MCP to show existing function examples\n3. Test small snippets first\n4. Reference official documentation: https://docs.xano.com/xanoscript/key-concepts\n\n**Common XanoScript mistakes**:\n- ❌ `db_query(\"users\")` → ✅ `db.query users { }`\n- ❌ `var my_var = \"value\"` → ✅ `var $my_var { value = \"value\" }`\n- ❌ `count($array)` → ✅ `$array|count`\n- ❌ `if (condition) {}` → ✅ `conditional { if ($condition) { } }`\n\n### Available MCP Tools\n\nOnce the plugin is enabled and environment variables are set, the Xano MCP server provides these tools automatically:\n\n- **Database operations**: Creating and modifying tables, schemas, relationships\n- **API development**: Building endpoints, configuring routes and methods\n- **Authentication**: Managing API keys, JWT, OAuth configurations\n- **Custom functions**: Creating business logic with XanoScript\n- **Background tasks**: Setting up scheduled and triggered jobs\n- **Documentation**: Generating OpenAPI specs for frontend integration\n- **Workspace management**: Configuring settings and permissions\n\n**Using MCP tools**: Simply ask Claude to perform Xano operations naturally (e.g., \"Create a users table with email and name fields\"). Claude will automatically use the appropriate Xano MCP tools to execute your requests.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n**Common issues**:\n- **Authentication errors**: Verify MCP token is correct and has required scopes\n- **XanoScript syntax errors**: Check function names, variable syntax, and filter usage\n- **Permission errors**: Ensure token has appropriate permissions for operation\n- **Rate limiting**: Xano has API rate limits - implement appropriate throttling\n\n**Debugging approach**:\n1. Test XanoScript in Xano's visual editor first\n2. Validate data types and structure\n3. Check API endpoint configuration\n4. Review error messages carefully\n5. Use Xano's built-in debugger and logs\n\n### Security Best Practices\n\n1. **Token management**:\n   - Never commit MCP tokens to version control\n   - Use environment variables or secure storage\n   - Rotate tokens periodically\n\n2. **API security**:\n   - Implement authentication on sensitive endpoints\n   - Use API key authentication or JWT\n   - Validate and sanitize all inputs\n   - Implement rate limiting\n\n3. **Data protection**:\n   - Use appropriate field types (encrypted for sensitive data)\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Regular backups before significant changes\n   - Test in non-production workspace first\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Create a Simple User Table and CRUD API\n\n**User request**:\n```\nI need a backend to store user profiles with name, email, and bio\n```\n\n**You would**:\n1. Use Xano MCP to create a table:\n   - Table name: `users`\n   - Fields:\n     - `name` (text, required)\n     - `email` (text, required, unique)\n     - `bio` (text, optional)\n     - `created_at` (timestamp, auto)\n\n2. Generate CRUD API endpoints:\n   - GET `/users` - List all users\n   - GET `/users/{id}` - Get single user\n   - POST `/users` - Create user\n   - PUT `/users/{id}` - Update user\n   - DELETE `/users/{id}` - Delete user\n\n3. Add email validation to POST endpoint using XanoScript:\n   ```xanoscript\n   conditional {\n     if ($email|is_email|not) {\n       response.error \"Invalid email format\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Test endpoints and return API documentation URLs\n\n### Example 2: Build LinkedIn OAuth Callback Handler\n\n**User request**:\n```\nCreate an endpoint to receive LinkedIn OAuth callback and store the access token\n```\n\n**You would**:\n1.

Show how to use the function in API endpoint\n4. Test with sample data\n\n### Example 4: Webhook Handler for External Service\n\n**User request**:\n```\nCreate a webhook endpoint to receive notifications from Stripe\n```\n\n**You would**:\n1. Create API endpoint:\n   - Method: `POST`\n   - Path: `/webhooks/stripe`\n   - Authentication: Verify Stripe signature\n\n2. Implement handler logic:\n   ```xanoscript\n   api stripe_webhook {\n     input {\n       text event_type\n       object data\n     }\n\n     stack {\n       // Log the webhook event\n       db.insert webhook_logs {\n         source = \"stripe\",\n         event_type = $event_type,\n         payload = $data,\n         received_at = timestamp.now\n       }\n\n       // Handle different event types\n       conditional {\n         if ($event_type == \"payment_intent.succeeded\") {\n           // Update order status\n           db.update orders {\n             where = { stripe_payment_id: $data.id },\n             set = { status: \"paid\", paid_at: timestamp.now }\n           }\n         }\n         elseif ($event_type == \"customer.subscription.deleted\") {\n           // Handle subscription cancellation\n           db.update users {\n             where = { stripe_customer_id: $data.customer },\n             set = { subscription_status: \"cancelled\" }\n           }\n         }\n       }\n\n       response = { received: true }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Configure Stripe webhook URL\n4. Test with Stripe webhook testing tool\n\n### Example 5: Scheduled Background Task\n\n**User request**:\n```\nSet up a daily task to clean up expired tokens\n```\n\n**You would**:\n1. Create background task:\n   - Name: `cleanup_expired_tokens`\n   - Schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM\n   - Type: Recurring\n\n2. Implement cleanup logic:\n   ```xanoscript\n   task cleanup_expired_tokens {\n     stack {\n       // Get current timestamp\n       var $now { value = timestamp.now }\n\n       // Find expired tokens\n       db.query oauth_tokens {\n         where = {\n           expires_at: { $lt: $now }\n         }\n       } as $expired_tokens\n\n       // Delete expired tokens\n       foreach ($expired_tokens) {\n         each as $token {\n           db.delete oauth_tokens {\n             where = { id: $token.id }\n           }\n         }\n       }\n\n       // Log cleanup result\n       db.insert task_logs {\n         task_name = \"cleanup_expired_tokens\",\n         tokens_deleted = $expired_tokens|count,\n         executed_at = $now\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Set up task schedule\n4. Test task execution manually\n5. Monitor task logs\n\n## Summary\n\nThis skill enables building complete backend systems using Xano's no-code platform through MCP integration. Create databases, APIs, and business logic using XanoScript - Xano's custom syntax. Always reference the XanoScript documentation when uncertain about syntax, and test incrementally to ensure correct implementation.\n\n**Key Resources**:\n- XanoScript Reference: [docs/xanoscript-reference.md](docs/xanoscript-reference.md)\n- Official Docs: https://docs.xano.com\n- MCP Setup: https://docs.xano.com/building/build-with-ai/xano-mcp\n"
