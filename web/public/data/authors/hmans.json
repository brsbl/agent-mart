You can use the `beans` CLI to interact with your tasks, but more importantly, so can your favorite coding agent!\n\nThis gives your robot friends a juicy upgrade: now they get a complete view of your project, make suggestions for what to work on next, track their progress, create bug issues for problems they find, and more.\n\nYou've been programming all your life; now you get to be a product manager. Let's go! 🚀\n\n## Announcement Trailer ✨\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe45408-d3ed-4681-a436-a5e3046163da\n\n## Stability Warning ⚠️\n\nBeans is still under heavy development, and its features and APIs may still change significantly. If you decide to use it now, please follow the release notes closely.\n\nSince Beans emits its own prompt instructions for your coding agent, most changes will \"just work\"; but sometimes, we modify the schema of the underlying data files, which may require some manual migration steps. If you get caught by one of these changes, your agent will often be able to migrate your data for you:\n\n```\nThe Beans data format has changed. Please migrate this project's beans to the new format.\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- **Track tasks, bugs, features**, and more right alongside your code.\n- **Plain old Markdown files** stored in a `.beans` directory in your project. Easy to version control, readable and editable by humans and machines alike!\n- Use the `beans` CLI to create, list, view, update, and archive beans; but more importantly, **let your coding agent do it for you**!\n- **Supercharge your robot friend** with full context about your project and its open tasks. A built-in **GraphQL query engine** allows your agent to get exactly the information it needs, keeping token use to a minimum.\n- **Project memory**: Completed beans are archived and serve as project memory that your coding agent can query for context about past work.\n- A beautiful **built-in** TUI for browsing and managing your beans from the terminal.\n- Generates a **Markdown roadmap document** for your project from your data.\n\n## Installation\n\nWe'll need to do three things:\n\n1. Install the `beans` CLI tool.\n2. Configure your project to use it.\n3. Configure your coding agent to interact with it.\n\nEither download Beans from the [Releases section](https://github.com/hmans/beans/releases), or install it via Homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install hmans/beans/beans\n```\n\nAlternatively, install directly via Go:\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/hmans/beans@latest\n```\n\n## Configure Your Project\n\nInside the root directory of your project, run:\n\n```bash\nbeans init\n```\n\nThis will create a `.beans/` directory and a `.beans.yml` configuration file at the project root. All of it is meant to be tracked in your version control system.\n\nFrom this point onward, you can interact with your Beans through the `beans` CLI. To get a list of available commands:\n\n```bash\nbeans help\n```\n\nBut more importantly, you'll want to get your coding agent set up to use it. Let's dive in!\n\n## Agent Configuration\n\nThe most basic way to teach your agent about Beans is to simply add the following instruction to your `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent file:\n\n```\n**IMPORTANT**: before you do anything else, run the `beans prime` command and heed its output.\n```\n\nSome agents provide mechanisms to automate this step:\n\n### Claude Code\n\nAn official Beans plugin for Claude is in the works, but for the time being, please manually add the following hooks to your project's `.claude/settings.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"SessionStart\": [\n      { \"hooks\": [{ \"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"beans prime\" }] }\n    ],\n    \"PreCompact\": [\n      { \"hooks\": [{ \"type\": \"command\", \"command\": \"beans prime\" }] }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### OpenCode\n\nBeans integrates with OpenCode via a plugin that injects task context into your sessions. To set it up, **copy the plugin** from [`.opencode/plugin/beans-prime.ts`](.opencode/plugin/beans-prime.ts) to your project's `.opencode/plugin/` directory (or `~/.opencode/plugin/` for global availability across all projects).\n\n## Usage Hints\n\nAs a human, you can get an overview of the CLI's functionalities by running:\n\n```bash\nbeans help\n```\n\nYou might specifically be interested in the interactive TUI:\n\n```bash\nbeans tui\n```\n\n### Example Workflows\n\n**But the real power of Beans** comes from letting your coding agent manage your tasks for you.\n\nAssuming you have integrated Beans into your coding agent correctly, it will already know how to create and manage beans for you. You can use the usual assortment of natural language inquiries. If you've just\nadded Beans to an existing project, you could try asking your agent to identify potential tasks and create beans for them:\n\n```\nAre there any tasks we should be tracking for this project? If so, please create beans for them.\n```\n\nIf you already have some beans available, you can ask your agent to recommend what to work on next:\n\n```\nWhat should we work on next?\n```\n\nYou can also specifically ask it to start working on a particular bean:\n\n```\nIt's time to tackle myproj-123.\n```\n\nConsider that your agent will be just as capable to deal with beans as it is with code, so how about using it to quickly restructure your tasks?\n\n```\nPlease inspect this project's beans and reorganize them into epics. Also please create 2-3 milestones to group these epics in a meaningful way.\n```\n\nYou can also add Beans-specific instructions to your `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent file, for example:\n\n```\nWhen making a commit, include the relevant bean IDs in the commit message\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project currently does not accept contributions -- it's just way too early for that!\nBut if you do have suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 License.
