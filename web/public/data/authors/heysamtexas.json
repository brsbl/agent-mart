        "README.md": "# About this project\n\nthis is where i save and share all my claude subagents, configs, tips, tricks,\nlies, half-truths, hopes, prayers, and encantations when using claude code.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nThis repository is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. You can install individual plugins for maximum flexibility and control.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing plugins, ensure you have:\n- **Claude Code** (latest version recommended)\n- **Git** (required for statusline branch display)\n- **Python environment** (for sam-texas-devtools plugin only):\n  - `uv` package manager\n  - `ruff` formatter\n  - Project with `src/` directory (or customize the hook path)\n\n### Add the Marketplace\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add heysamtexas/claude-code-config\n```\n\nThis creates a marketplace named **sam-texas-marketplace** based on the repository's marketplace.json.\n\nOr for local development:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-code-config\n```\n\n### Install Plugins\n\nInstall what you need from the sam-texas-marketplace:\n\n```bash\n# Install individual agents\n/plugin install gilfoyle@sam-texas-marketplace\n/plugin install copywriter@sam-texas-marketplace\n/plugin install coverage-enforcer@sam-texas-marketplace\n/plugin install spyros@sam-texas-marketplace\n\n# Install productivity commands\n/plugin install sam-texas-commands@sam-texas-marketplace\n\n# Install development hooks (pre-commit formatting, statusline)\n/plugin install sam-texas-devtools@sam-texas-marketplace\n```\n\nIf this is your only marketplace, you can omit the `@sam-texas-marketplace` suffix:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install gilfoyle\n```\n\n### Manage Plugins\n\n```bash\n# Browse available plugins\n/plugin\n\n# Enable/disable plugins independently\n/plugin disable gilfoyle\n/plugin enable gilfoyle\n\n# Remove plugins you no longer need\n/plugin uninstall coverage-enforcer\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installing plugins, confirm they're active:\n\n```bash\n# List all installed plugins\n/plugin list\n\n# Verify agents are available by invoking them\n# Example: Ask Claude to use Gilfoyle for code review\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n**Plugin not found after installation**\n- Verify marketplace was added: `/plugin marketplace list`\n- Check plugin name spelling matches exactly\n- Try with full syntax: `/plugin install gilfoyle@sam-texas-marketplace`\n\n**Pre-commit hook not working** (sam-texas-devtools)\n- Confirm `uv` is installed and in PATH\n- Verify `src/` directory exists in project root\n- Test manually: `uv run ruff format src/`\n- Customize path in `.claude/settings.json` if your code is not in `src/`\n\n**Statusline not showing** (sam-texas-devtools)\n- Verify `.claude/settings.json` includes statusLine configuration (see plugin README)\n- Check script is executable: `ls -la .claude/plugins/sam-texas-devtools/statusline.sh`\n- Requires git repository for branch display\n\n**Note:** The `sam-texas-devtools` plugin requires a Python environment with `uv` and `ruff`. Projects must have a `src/` directory or you'll need to customize the hook path.\n\n---\n\n## The Subagent Yearbook 📸\n\n*Class of Claude Code 2025*\n\nMeet the team of specialized AI agents who make code better, documentation clearer, and test coverage unimpeachable. Each has their own personality, expertise, and tolerance for mediocrity.\n\n---\n\n### 🏛️ Gilfoyle - Senior Staff Engineer (Eternal)\n\n<img src=\"https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp11727456.jpg\" alt=\"Gilfoyle\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n\n**Quote:** *\"I've been writing code since before frameworks had frameworks. Now let me show you why your solution is wrong.\"*\n\n**Personality:**\n- Direct. Brutally so.\n- Hunts complexity like it owes him money\n- Speaks in code, architecture diagrams, and war stories\n- Has been through three rewrites with the CEO\n\n**Most Likely To:**\nTurn your 300-line function into three functions so obvious they explain themselves\n\n**When to Call:**\n- Code review is taking too long because something feels wrong\n- Your architecture is becoming unmaintainable\n- You wrote something clever and want to make sure it's not *too* clever\n- The junior dev needs mentoring that will actually stick\n- You're about to add another framework to solve a simple problem\n\n**Signature Style:**\nWill find the abstraction you didn't need, the dependency you could have avoided, and the edge case that will wake you up at 3 AM next Tuesday.\n\n**File:** `.claude/agents/gilfoyle.md`\n\n---\n\n### ✍️ Copywriter - Technical Copywriter (Persnickety Edition)\n\n**Quote:** *\"Ambiguity is the enemy. Clarity is the weapon. Structure is the shield.\"*\n\n**Personality:**\n- Persnickety and pedantic in the best way\n- Wields words like a surgeon wields a scalpel\n- Zero tolerance for \"usually\" and \"typically\"\n- Understands that unclear documentation is the enemy of good software\n\n**Most Likely To:**\nRewrite your entire README because one sentence was ambiguous to AI agents\n\n**When to Call:**\n- Creating or reviewing documentation, README files, or user-facing content\n- Writing error messages that need to help instead of confuse\n- Documenting APIs that should prevent support tickets\n- Any text that will be read by both humans and AI agents\n\n**Signature Style:**\nProvides dual-audience documentation with LLM-friendly templates, explicit success/failure indicators, decision trees, and guardrails. Bans words like \"should work\" in favor of \"works when conditions A, B, C are met.\"\n\n**File:** `.claude/agents/copywriter_subagent.md`\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Coverage Enforcer - Django Coverage Specialist\n\n**Quote:** *\"Your tests are lies until coverage proves they're truth.\"*\n\n**Personality:**\n- Django-aware and uncompromising\n- Focuses on business logic, not ORM internals\n- Creates actionable tasks, not just complaints\n- Knows the difference between 75% coverage and 75% *meaningful* coverage\n\n**Most Likely To:**\nGenerate 15 detailed task files for every coverage gap in your Django app\n\n**When to Call:**\n- Analyzing Django test coverage\n- Enforcing coverage standards before merge\n- Understanding which Django components need more tests\n- Creating systematic coverage improvement plans\n\n**Signature Style:**\nGenerates detailed task files in `tasks/coverage-*.md` with Django-specific test patterns, success criteria, and component-aware recommendations. Enforces 75% overall, 90% for new features, with specialized thresholds for models, views, and management commands.\n\n**File:** `.claude/agents/coverage_subagent.md`\n\n---\n\n### 🛡️ Spyros - Chief Compliance Officer\n\n<img src=\"https://www.sho.com/site/image-bin/images/1032076_6_0/1032076_6_0_ext08_1280x640.jpg\" alt=\"Ari Spyros\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n**Quote:** *\"I want to be very clear with you - and I'm telling you this as someone who's trying to protect you - we need to talk about your access control strategy.\"*\n\n**Personality:**\n- Earnest. Very earnest. Some might say *too* earnest.\n- Personally invested in keeping everyone audit-ready\n- Self-aware about being \"that guy\" but persists anyway\n- Knows the difference between \"auditor will flag this\" and \"best practice but not required\"\n\n**Most Likely To:**\nDraw a hard line on secrets management while apologizing for the friction it creates\n\n**When to Call:**\n- Before deploying access control changes\n- Implementing authentication or authorization\n- Setting up logging, monitoring, or audit trails\n- Making secrets management decisions\n- Architectural choices with security implications\n- When honestly unsure if something creates SOC 2 compliance risk\n\n**Signature Style:**\nProvides compliance reviews with explicit hard lines vs. negotiable paths. Focuses on code and infrastructure controls for SOC 2 Type II (access controls, change management, monitoring, encryption, logging, incident response, secrets management). Suggests minimum viable compliance approaches and knows when to say \"this isn't my concern.\"\n\n**File:** `.claude/agents/spyros.md`\n\n---\n\n## Slash Commands\n\nQuick actions for common workflows:\n\n**`/catchmeup`** - Get a quick conversational summary of recent commits and current work status when jumping back into a project. Perfect for those \"wait, what was I doing?\" moments.\n\n**`/auditclaudemd`** - Review the CLAUDE.md file against current Claude Code best practices. Reads the latest docs, evaluates what's good/bad/missing, and hunts for redundancy and cruft.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Hooks\n\nAutomated workflows triggered by events:\n\n**Pre-Commit Formatting** - Automatically runs `ruff format src/` and stages changes before any `git commit` command. Ensures code is always formatted before it hits the repo.\n\n### Status Line\n\nCustom status line showing model name, current directory, and git branch. Configured to run `.claude/statusline.sh` from the project directory.\n\n**Configuration:** `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/statusline.sh`\n\n\n",
        "plugins/sam-texas-devtools/README.md": "# sam-texas-devtools Plugin\n\nDevelopment workflow automation: pre-commit formatting and custom statusline.\n\n## What's Included\n\n### Pre-Commit Formatting Hook\nAutomatically formats Python code with `ruff format` before every commit.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Project must have `src/` directory\n- `uv` must be installed\n- `ruff` must be available via `uv run ruff`\n\n**How it works:**\nWhen you run `git commit`, Claude Code will automatically:\n1. Run `ruff format src/`\n2. Stage the formatted changes\n3. Proceed with the commit\n\n### Custom Status Line\nShows model name, current directory, and git branch in your Claude Code status line.\n\n**Display Format:** `[MODEL] 📁 directory | 🌿 branch`\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Git repository (for branch display)\n\n## Manual Setup Required: Status Line\n\nAfter installing this plugin, the statusline script will be located at:\n`.claude/plugins/sam-texas-devtools/statusline.sh`\n\nAdd this configuration to your `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statusLine\": {\n    \"type\": \"command\",\n    \"command\": \".claude/plugins/sam-texas-devtools/statusline.sh\",\n    \"padding\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Verification:** Restart Claude Code or reload settings to see the statusline appear.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Change Formatting Target\nIf your Python code is not in `src/`, edit the hook in `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PreToolUse\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"Bash(git commit:*)\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bash -c 'cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) && uv run ruff format YOUR_DIRECTORY/ && git add -u'\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Disable Pre-Commit Hook\nIf you want the statusline but not the pre-commit hook, disable or remove the hook configuration from your settings.\n"
