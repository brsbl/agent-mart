        "README.md": "A personal library of AI prompts and Claude Code skills for writing, interview prep, translation, language learning, and education.\n\nEach tool in this repo is available in **two forms**:\n\n- **Prompts** (`prompts/`) — standalone system prompts you can copy-paste into any AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). They follow a two-step **Prompt Priming** approach: the assistant first acknowledges the instructions and asks for input, then processes it using the specified format.\n- **Skills** (`skills/`) — the same tools packaged as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin, installable via the marketplace.\n\n## Installing as a Claude Code plugin\n\nAdd the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add lavrovpy/al-prompts\n/plugin install alavreniuk-skills@alavreniuk-skills\n```\n\nAfter installation, skills are available as slash commands (e.g. `/interview-questions-creator`). To update later:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace update\n```\n\n## Prompts\n\n- `prompts/editor.md`: Senior English editor and writing coach for polishing professional text.\n  - Example: Paste a draft email or Slack message; get a revised version plus a change summary and rating.\n- `prompts/interview-coach.md`: FAANG-style interview coach for feedback on technical interview answers.\n  - Example: Provide an interview question and your answer; get a score, strengths, and improvement hints.\n- `prompts/interview-questions-creator.md`: FAANG-style interviewer that generates high-signal questions from provided materials.\n  - Example: Attach a design doc or study notes; receive 5-7 deep-dive questions.\n- `prompts/notes-verification-assistant.md`: Academic verifier that audits notes for accuracy and rewrites them for study.\n  - Example: Paste study notes; get an audit and a revised, high-density version.\n- `prompts/translator-en-ukr.md`: English ↔ Ukrainian translator with nuance and context handling.\n  - Example: Paste text in English or Ukrainian; get a fluent translation with nuance notes.\n- `prompts/duolingo-at-home.md`: Simulated video call language practice with a sarcastic teenage character named Lily.\n  - Example: Start a conversation in your target language at A2 level; get casual, immersive practice.\n- `prompts/quick-grammar-check.md`: Fast grammar, spelling, and consistency check.\n  - Example: Paste a sentence; get \"Correct.\" or a fix with a brief explanation.\n- `prompts/nmt-test.md`: Educational assessment question generator for standardized exam prep (Ukrainian NMT).\n  - Example: Specify a subject and topic; get well-structured multiple-choice or open-ended questions.\n"
