        "README.md": "# Vibeship Plugin for Claude Code\n\n**Ship faster with an AI that actually remembers your project.**\n\nStop re-explaining your codebase every session. Vibeship gives Claude Code persistent memory, specialist skills for your stack, and security scanning - all in one install.\n\n## Why Vibeship?\n\nYou're vibe coding - shipping fast, iterating quickly, building products. But every new Claude session starts from zero. You waste time re-explaining decisions, re-discovering gotchas, re-learning your own codebase.\n\n**Vibeship fixes this.**\n\n- **Memory** - Claude remembers your project across sessions. Decisions, learnings, problems - all persisted.\n- **Skills** - Claude loads specialized knowledge for your stack. Next.js + Supabase? It knows the sharp edges.\n- **Security** - Scan for vulnerabilities before you ship. Get AI-generated fixes.\n\n## Quick Start (2 minutes)\n\n### Option 1: Marketplace Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the Vibeship marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add vibeforge1111/vibeship-plugin\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install vibeship@vibeforge1111\n```\n\n### Option 2: Manual Install\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/vibeforge1111/vibeship-plugin.git\n\n# Copy to plugins directory\n# macOS/Linux\ncp -r vibeship-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/\n\n# Windows\nxcopy vibeship-plugin %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\plugins\\vibeship-plugin /E /I\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code. You're ready to ship.\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n### `/vibeship-init`\n**Start here for new projects.** Your magic first moment with Vibeship:\n- Detects your existing codebase and tech stack\n- Sets up memory for your project\n- Gets you productive in under 60 seconds\n\n### `/vibeship-start`\nStart a Vibeship session. Loads your project memory and greets you with context.\n\n### `/vibeship-save`\nSave something important to memory:\n- Decisions you made and why\n- Learnings you want to remember\n- Problems you encountered and how you solved them\n- Progress milestones\n\n### `/vibeship-status`\nCheck what's being remembered:\n- Local memory health\n- Cloud skills loaded\n- Current session state\n- Any blockers or issues\n\n### `/vibeship-scan`\nRun a security scan on your code:\n- Scan current project or any GitHub repo\n- See vulnerabilities by severity\n- Get AI-generated fixes\n- Look up CVE/CWE details\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Memory (Mind MCP)\nLocal persistent memory stored in your project:\n- `.mind/MEMORY.md` - Permanent cross-session memory\n- `.mind/SESSION.md` - Current session notes\n\n### Skills (Spawner MCP)\nCloud-hosted specialist knowledge:\n- Stack-specific gotchas and best practices\n- Validation rules for your tech choices\n- Onboarding guidance for new projects\n\n### Security (Scanner MCP)\nCode scanning powered by:\n- Opengrep (SAST)\n- Trivy (dependencies)\n- Gitleaks (secrets)\n- npm audit (Node packages)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code 2.0.0 or later\n- Node.js 18+ (for mcp-remote)\n- Internet connection (for Spawner and Scanner)\n\n## Privacy\n\n**Local Memory (Mind)**: Stored only on your machine in `.mind/` folder. Add to `.gitignore` if you don't want to version it.\n\n**Cloud Skills (Spawner)**: Your project context is sent to `mcp.vibeship.co` to load relevant skills. No code is stored.\n\n**Security Scans (Scanner)**: Repository URLs are sent to `scanner.vibeship.co`. Scan results are stored for 30 days.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### MCP servers not connecting\nCheck that `npx` is available and you have internet access:\n```bash\nnpx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.vibeship.co/mcp\n```\n\n### Memory not persisting\nMake sure the `.mind/` folder is writable. Check `mind_status()` for health info.\n\n### Scanner authentication for private repos\nRun `/vibeship-scan` and follow the auth flow to scan private repositories.\n\n### Mind CLI not found\nMind requires separate installation.

        "commands/init.md": "---\ntitle: Initialize Vibeship\ndescription: Set up Vibeship for a new or existing project - your magic first moment\n---\n\n# Vibeship Initialization\n\nWelcome a new user to Vibeship! This is their \"magic first moment\" - make it count.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Value in under 60 seconds.** Don't ask for configuration. Don't require IDs. Just help them get started immediately.\n\n## Step 1: Warm Welcome\n\nStart with excitement, not questions:\n\n```\nWelcome to Vibeship! I'm about to give you superpowers:\n\n- I'll remember your project decisions across sessions\n- I'll load specialist skills for your tech stack\n- I'll scan your code for security issues before they ship\n\nLet's get you set up in about 30 seconds.\n```\n\n## Step 2: Detect Current State\n\nSilently check what exists:\n\n1. **Check for existing `.mind/` folder** - If exists, they may already be set up\n2. **Check for `package.json`** - Detect the tech stack\n3. **Check for `.git/`** - See if it's a git repo\n\nBased on findings, take the appropriate path:\n\n### Path A: Existing Vibeship Project\nIf `.mind/` exists with content:\n```\nLooks like Vibeship is already set up here!\n\nI found your project memory with:\n- X decisions remembered\n- X learnings captured\n- Last session: [date]\n\nRun `/vibeship-start` to load your context and continue where you left off.\n```\n\n### Path B: Existing Codebase, New to Vibeship\nIf code exists but no `.mind/`:\n```\nI see you have an existing project here. Let me analyze it...\n\n**Detected Stack:**\n- [Framework]: Next.js 14\n- [Database]: Supabase\n- [Styling]: Tailwind CSS\n\n**What I'll Do:**\n1. Create `.mind/` folder for your project memory\n2. Load specialist skills for your stack\n3. Remember decisions you make from now on\n\nReady to initialize? (I'll create a .mind/ folder in your project)\n```\n\nThen call `mind_recall()` to initialize the memory system.\n\n### Path C: Empty Directory\nIf no code exists:\n```\nFresh start - I love it!\n\n**What do you want to build?**\n- A SaaS product\n- A marketplace\n- An AI-powered tool\n- Something else\n\nTell me your idea and I'll help you plan it out with the right stack and skills.\n```\n\nThen guide them to `spawner_plan(idea=\"...\")`.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize Memory\n\nOnce they're ready, set up memory:\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize Mind memory\nmind_recall()\n\n// Log the initialization\nmind_log(\"Vibeship initialized for this project\", type=\"progress\")\n```\n\n## Step 4: Confirm Success\n\nShow them what just happened:\n\n```\n## Vibeship is Ready!\n\n**Memory**: Initialized at `.mind/`\n**Skills**: [X skills loaded for your stack]\n**Commands Available**:\n- `/vibeship-start` - Begin a session (loads your context)\n- `/vibeship-save` - Save decisions and learnings\n- `/vibeship-status` - See what I remember\n- `/vibeship-scan` - Security scan your code\n\n**Pro tip**: I'll remember important decisions automatically, but you can always use `/vibeship-save` to explicitly capture something.\n\nWhat would you like to build today?\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### If Mind MCP isn't connected:\n\n```\nI couldn't connect to the Memory service.\n\n**What this means:**\n- Your decisions won't persist between sessions\n- You can still use Vibeship, just without memory\n\n**How to fix it:**\n1. Install Mind CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic/mind`\n2. Verify it works: `mind --version`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\nWant to continue without memory for now, or fix this first?\n```\n\n### If Spawner MCP isn't connected:\n\n```\nI couldn't connect to the Skills service.\n\n**What this means:**\n- I won't have specialist knowledge for your stack\n- Basic Claude capabilities still work fine\n\n**How to fix it:**\n1. Check your internet connection\n2. Try: `curl https://mcp.vibeship.co/health`\n3. Restart Claude Code to reconnect\n\nWant to continue without skills for now, or fix this first?\n```\n\n### If both fail:\n\n```\nVibeship services aren't connecting right now.\n\n**The good news:** You can still code normally with Claude.\n**What you're missing:** Persistent memory and specialist skills.\n\n**Quick fixes to try:**\n1. Check internet connection\n2. Restart Claude Code\n3. Run `claude mcp list` to verify MCP status\n\nI'll keep trying to connect in the background. Just start working and I'll let you know when services are back!\n```\n\n## Remember: Magic First Moment\n\nThe goal is to make the user feel:\n1. **Welcomed** - Not interrogated\n2. **Capable** - Not confused\n3. **Excited** - Not overwhelmed\n\nGive them value immediately. Configuration can come later.\n",

Help them capture it properly.\n\n## What to Save\n\nAsk the user (if not already clear) what type of thing they want to save:\n\n1. **Decision** - A choice that was made and why\n   - Example: \"Decided to use Supabase instead of Firebase because of RLS\"\n\n2. **Learning** - Something discovered that's worth remembering\n   - Example: \"Learned that Next.js middleware runs on every request\"\n\n3. **Problem** - An issue encountered and how it was resolved\n   - Example: \"Webhook signatures were failing because body wasn't raw\"\n\n4. **Progress** - A milestone or completion update\n   - Example: \"Finished the authentication flow\"\n\n## How to Save\n\n### For permanent memory (decisions, learnings, problems):\n\nUse `mind_log` with the appropriate type:\n```\nmind_log(\"Your message here\", type=\"decision\")  // or \"learning\", \"problem\", \"progress\"\n```\n\n### Also save to Spawner (for cloud backup):\n\nUse `spawner_remember`:\n```\nspawner_remember({\n  update: {\n    decision: { what: \"...\", why: \"...\" }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Confirm the Save\n\nAfter saving, confirm to the user:\n- What was saved\n- Where it was saved (Mind local + Spawner cloud)\n- That it will be available next session\n\nExample response:\n\"Saved your decision to use RLS. I'll remember this next time and it's backed up to the cloud.\"\n\n## Be Proactive\n\nIf you notice the user made an important decision during the conversation that wasn't explicitly saved, offer to save it:\n\n\"I noticed you decided to [X] because [Y]. Want me to save that for future reference?\"\n\n## Handling Errors\n\n### If Mind MCP fails to save:\n\n```\n## Couldn't Save to Local Memory\n\n**What happened:** The memory service didn't respond.\n\n**Your data is NOT lost!** Here's what I captured:\n> \"[The content they wanted to save]\"\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Copy the text above (just in case)\n2. Try: Restart Claude Code and run `/vibeship-save` again\n3. Or manually add to `.mind/MEMORY.md` in your project\n\n**Want me to try saving to cloud backup (Spawner) instead?**\n```\n\n### If Spawner fails to save:\n\n```\n## Couldn't Backup to Cloud\n\n**Local save succeeded!** Your memory is safe in `.mind/MEMORY.md`\n\n**Cloud backup failed** - this just means:\n- No offsite backup this time\n- You won't lose anything\n- Cloud will sync next time it connects\n\n**No action needed.** Your important stuff is saved locally.\n```\n\n### If user's input is unclear:\n\n```\n## What Would You Like to Save?\n\nI want to help, but I'm not sure what to capture. Could you tell me:\n\n**What type is it?**\n- Decision (a choice you made)\n- Learning (something you discovered)\n- Problem (an issue and its solution)\n- Progress (a milestone reached)\n\n**What's the content?**\nJust describe it in a sentence or two.\n\n**Example:** \"Decision: Using Supabase for auth because it has built-in RLS\"\n```\n\n### After successful save:\n\nAlways confirm with context:\n\n```\n## Saved!\n\n**Type:** Decision\n**Content:** \"Using Stripe for payments because of better subscription management\"\n\n**Where it's stored:**\n- Local: `.mind/MEMORY.md`\n- Cloud: Spawner backup\n\n**I'll remember this** when you ask about payments, billing, or subscription decisions.\n```\n",

Help them run a comprehensive scan.\n\n## Step 1: Determine What to Scan\n\nAsk (if not clear) what they want to scan:\n\n1. **Current project** - Scan the codebase they're working in\n2. **GitHub repository** - Scan a specific repo URL\n3. **Specific files** - Focus on particular files or directories\n\n## Step 2: Start the Scan\n\nUse `scanner_scan` tool:\n```\nscanner_scan({\n  repo_url: \"https://github.com/owner/repo\",\n  branch: \"main\"  // optional\n})\n```\n\nFor local projects, you'll need to:\n- Check if project has a GitHub remote\n- Use that URL for scanning\n- Or explain that local-only scanning requires pushing to GitHub first\n\n## Step 3: Monitor Progress\n\nThe scan runs asynchronously. Use `scanner_status` to check progress:\n```\nscanner_status({ scan_id: \"...\" })\n```\n\nKeep the user informed:\n- \"Scan started! ID: xxx\"\n- \"Scanning... 45% complete\"\n- \"Scan finished!

Ask me: \"Help me fix the SQL injection in db/query.js\"\n\n### Get Help:\n\n- `/vibeship-scan fix 1` - AI-generated fix for issue #1\n- `/vibeship-scan explain [CWE-ID]` - Learn about the vulnerability type\n- \"Review my auth code for security issues\" - Manual review\n\n**I can help fix each issue.** Which one should we tackle first?\n```\n\n### If repo URL is invalid:\n\n```\n## Invalid Repository\n\n**Couldn't access:** [url]\n\n**This might be because:**\n- The URL has a typo\n- The repo is private (scanner needs public access)\n- The repo doesn't exist\n\n**For private repos:**\n1. Make sure the repo exists on GitHub\n2. Check if it's set to public\n3. Or push to a public fork for scanning\n\n**Correct format:** `https://github.com/owner/repo`\n\n**Want to scan the current local project instead?**\n```\n\n## Remember the Results\n\nAfter scanning, offer to save important findings to memory:\n```\nmind_log(\"Security scan found 3 critical XSS vulnerabilities in auth flow\", type=\"problem\")\n```\n\nThis helps track what's been found and fixed over time.\n",

Follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Load Memory Context\n\nFirst, call `mind_recall()` to load the user's project context from previous sessions.\n\nIf this returns context, acknowledge what was loaded:\n- Project goal\n- Last session summary\n- Any pending reminders\n- Current blockers\n\n## Step 2: Detect Project Context\n\nCall `spawner_orchestrate` with:\n- `cwd`: The current working directory\n- `files`: List of files in the project (from `ls` or file listing)\n- `mind_memory`: Content from `.mind/MEMORY.md` if it exists\n- `mind_session`: Content from `.mind/SESSION.md` if it exists\n\n## Step 3: Greet Based on Path\n\nBased on the orchestration result:\n\n### If path = \"resume\"\nGreet warmly with project context:\n\"Welcome back to **[project name]**! Last time we [summary]. Ready to continue?\"\n\n### If path = \"analyze\"\nAcknowledge the new codebase:\n\"I've analyzed your codebase. Detected [stack]. I've loaded skills for [technologies]. What would you like to build?\"\n\n### If path = \"brainstorm\"\nHelp them start fresh:\n\"No existing project detected. Tell me what you want to build and I'll help you plan it out!\"\n\n## Step 4: Set the Tone\n\nRemind the user they can:\n- Ask `/vibeship-save` to capture decisions\n- Ask `/vibeship-status` to check what's remembered\n- Just start building - you'll handle the rest\n\nKeep it conversational and helpful. This is the start of a productive session!\n\n## Handling Connection Issues\n\nAlways provide **actionable guidance**, not just error messages.\n\n### If Mind MCP fails:\n\n```\n## Memory Unavailable\n\n**What's happening:** I can't connect to your local memory service.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n- I won't remember decisions from previous sessions\n- This session still works, just without history\n- Nothing is lost - your `.mind/` folder is still there\n\n**How to fix it (pick one):**\n1. **Quick fix:** Restart Claude Code (often resolves connection issues)\n2. **Check installation:** Run `mind --version` in terminal\n3. **Reinstall:** `npm install -g @anthropic/mind`\n\n**Want to continue anyway?** I can still help you code - just tell me what you're working on!\n```\n\nProceed without memory - the session can still work, just without persistence.\n\n### If Spawner MCP fails:\n\n```\n## Skills Unavailable\n\n**What's happening:** I can't reach the Vibeship skills server.\n\n**What this means for you:**\n- I won't have specialist knowledge for your stack\n- Core Claude capabilities work perfectly\n- No data is lost\n\n**How to fix it (pick one):**\n1. **Check internet:** Can you reach other websites?\n2. **Test connection:** `curl https://mcp.vibeship.co/health`\n3. **Restart:** Close and reopen Claude Code\n\n**Want to continue anyway?** I'm still a capable coding assistant - let's build!\n```\n\nProceed without skills - core Claude capabilities still work.\n\n### If both fail:\n\n```\n## Vibeship Services Unavailable\n\n**What's happening:** Neither memory nor skills services are connecting.\n\n**What this means:**\n- You can still code normally with Claude\n- Memory won't persist this session\n- Specialist skills won't load\n\n**Quick troubleshooting:**\n1. Check internet connection\n2. Run `claude mcp list` to see MCP status\n3. Restart Claude Code\n\n**The most common fix:** Simply restart Claude Code. This resolves 90% of connection issues.\n\n**Ready to work anyway?** Just tell me what you're building!\n```\n\nNever block the user - always offer a path forward.\n",
        "commands/status.md": "---\ntitle: Check Status\ndescription: Check what Vibeship remembers about your project and current session\n---\n\n# Vibeship Status Check\n\nThe user wants to see what's being remembered about their project. Show them a clear overview.\n\n## Step 1: Get Memory Status\n\nCall `mind_status()` to check the health of local memory.\n\n## Step 2: Get Session State\n\nCall `mind_session()` to get:\n- Current goal\n- Current approach\n- Active blockers\n- Rejected approaches\n- Working assumptions\n- Recent discoveries\n\n## Step 3: Get Spawner Project Status\n\nCall `spawner_orchestrate` with minimal context to see what the cloud remembers:\n- Project recognition\n- Loaded skills\n- Loaded rules\n\n## Step 4: Present Status Clearly\n\nFormat the response like this:\n\n```\n## 🧠 Your Project Memory\n\n**Project**: [name from spawner or mind]\n**Goal**: [goal from mind session]\n**Stack**: [detected stack]\n\n### Local Memory (Mind)\n- Decisions remembered: X\n- Learnings captured: X\n- Problems documented: X\n- Memory health: [healthy/needs attention]\n\n### Cloud Memory (Spawner)\n- Skills loaded: [list]\n- Rules active: [list]\n- Project ID: [id]\n\n### Current Session\n- Blockers: [list or \"None\"]\n- Assumptions: [list or \"None\"]\n- Last activity: [timestamp]\n```\n\n## Step 5: Offer Actions\n\nIf there are issues, suggest fixes:\n- \"Your local memory is getting large. Want me to summarize old entries?\"\n- \"No goal is set for this session. What are you working on?\"\n- \"You have 3 unresolved blockers. Want to tackle them?\"\n\n## Keep It Actionable\n\nThe status check should lead to action, not just information. Always end with:\n- What's going well\n- What needs attention\n- A suggested next step\n\n## Handling Errors\n\n### If Mind status fails:\n\n```\n## Local Memory Status Unknown\n\n**What happened:** Couldn't connect to memory service.\n\n**What I can tell you:**\n- Check if `.mind/` folder exists in your project\n- If it exists, your memories are safe (just can't read them right now)\n- If it doesn't exist, run `/vibeship-init` to set up\n\n**Quick fix:** Restart Claude Code and try `/vibeship-status` again.\n\n**In the meantime:** What are you working on? I can still help!\n```\n\n### If Spawner status fails:\n\n```\n## Cloud Status Unavailable\n\n**Local memory is working!** Here's what I found:\n[Show local memory status]\n\n**Cloud status couldn't load** - this means:\n- Can't show loaded skills right now\n- Your project data is still safe\n- Skills will reload when connection returns\n\n**No action needed** unless you want to fix the connection:\n1. Check internet\n2. Run `curl https://mcp.vibeship.co/health`\n3. Restart Claude Code\n```\n\n### If memory is empty:\n\n```\n## Fresh Start Detected\n\n**No memories found yet** - and that's okay!\n\nThis means either:\n- You're new to this project (welcome!)\n- Memory was recently cleared\n- The `.mind/` folder doesn't exist yet\n\n**To get started:**\n1. Run `/vibeship-init` to set up memory\n2. Or just start coding - I'll offer to save important decisions as we go\n\n**Pro tip:** Use `/vibeship-save` anytime you make a decision worth remembering.\n```\n\n### If memory is very large:\n\n```\n## Memory Health Check\n\n**Your memory is getting large** (X entries, Y KB)\n\n**This might slow things down.** Consider:\n\n1. **Summarize old entries:**\n   \"Hey, can you summarize my old decisions into key points?\"\n\n2. **Archive completed projects:**\n   Move old `.mind/` to a backup location\n\n3. **Clean up duplicates:**\n   I can help identify redundant memories\n\n**Want me to analyze your memory and suggest what to clean up?**\n```\n\n### Status display format:\n\nAlways use this structure for clarity:\n\n```\n## Vibeship Status\n\n### Memory (Local)\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Decisions | 12 |\n| Learnings | 8 |\n| Problems | 3 |\n| Health | Healthy |\n\n### Skills (Cloud)\n| Loaded | Status |\n|--------|--------|\n| Next.js App Router | Active |\n| Supabase Backend | Active |\n| TypeScript Strict | Active |\n\n### Current Session\n- **Goal:** Building auth flow\n- **Blockers:** None\n- **Active for:** 45 minutes\n\n### Recommendations\n1. Your session is going well!\n2. Consider saving your progress before taking a break\n3. Next suggested action: [based on context]\n```\n",
