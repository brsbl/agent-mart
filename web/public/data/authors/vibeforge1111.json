        "README.md": "# Vibeship Plugin for Claude Code\n\n**Ship faster with an AI that actually remembers your project.**\n\nStop re-explaining your codebase every session. Vibeship gives Claude Code persistent memory, specialist skills for your stack, and security scanning - all in one install.\n\n## Why Vibeship?\n\nYou're vibe coding - shipping fast, iterating quickly, building products. But every new Claude session starts from zero. You waste time re-explaining decisions, re-discovering gotchas, re-learning your own codebase.\n\n**Vibeship fixes this.**\n\n- **Memory** - Claude remembers your project across sessions. Decisions, learnings, problems - all persisted.\n- **Skills** - Claude loads specialized knowledge for your stack. Next.js + Supabase? It knows the sharp edges.\n- **Security** - Scan for vulnerabilities before you ship. Get AI-generated fixes.\n\n## Quick Start (2 minutes)\n\n### Option 1: Marketplace Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the Vibeship marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add vibeforge1111/vibeship-plugin\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install vibeship@vibeforge1111\n```\n\n### Option 2: Manual Install\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/vibeforge1111/vibeship-plugin.git\n\n# Copy to plugins directory\n# macOS/Linux\ncp -r vibeship-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/\n\n# Windows\nxcopy vibeship-plugin %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\plugins\\vibeship-plugin /E /I\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code. You're ready to ship.\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n### `/vibeship-init`\n**Start here for new projects.** Your magic first moment with Vibeship:\n- Detects your existing codebase and tech stack\n- Sets up memory for your project\n- Gets you productive in under 60 seconds\n\n### `/vibeship-start`\nStart a Vibeship session. Loads your project memory and greets you with context.\n\n### `/vibeship-save`\nSave something important to memory:\n- Decisions you made and why\n- Learnings you want to remember\n- Problems you encountered and how you solved them\n- Progress milestones\n\n### `/vibeship-status`\nCheck what's being remembered:\n- Local memory health\n- Cloud skills loaded\n- Current session state\n- Any blockers or issues\n\n### `/vibeship-scan`\nRun a security scan on your code:\n- Scan current project or any GitHub repo\n- See vulnerabilities by severity\n- Get AI-generated fixes\n- Look up CVE/CWE details\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Memory (Mind MCP)\nLocal persistent memory stored in your project:\n- `.mind/MEMORY.md` - Permanent cross-session memory\n- `.mind/SESSION.md` - Current session notes\n\n### Skills (Spawner MCP)\nCloud-hosted specialist knowledge:\n- Stack-specific gotchas and best practices\n- Validation rules for your tech choices\n- Onboarding guidance for new projects\n\n### Security (Scanner MCP)\nCode scanning powered by:\n- Opengrep (SAST)\n- Trivy (dependencies)\n- Gitleaks (secrets)\n- npm audit (Node packages)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code 2.0.0 or later\n- Node.js 18+ (for mcp-remote)\n- Internet connection (for Spawner and Scanner)\n\n## Privacy\n\n**Local Memory (Mind)**: Stored only on your machine in `.mind/` folder. Add to `.gitignore` if you don't want to version it.\n\n**Cloud Skills (Spawner)**: Your project context is sent to `mcp.vibeship.co` to load relevant skills. No code is stored.\n\n**Security Scans (Scanner)**: Repository URLs are sent to `scanner.vibeship.co`. Scan results are stored for 30 days.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### MCP servers not connecting\nCheck that `npx` is available and you have internet access:\n```bash\nnpx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.vibeship.co/mcp\n```\n\n### Memory not persisting\nMake sure the `.mind/` folder is writable. Check `mind_status()` for health info.\n\n### Scanner authentication for private repos\nRun `/vibeship-scan` and follow the auth flow to scan private repositories.\n\n### Mind CLI not found\nMind requires separate installation. See: https://github.com/anthropics/mind\n\n## Support\n\n- Issues: https://github.com/vibeforge1111/vibeship-plugin/issues\n- Docs: https://vibeship.co/docs\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/vibeship\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n"
