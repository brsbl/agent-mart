As tokens accumulate during a long session, reasoning quality degrades, hallucinations increase, and the model starts losing track of earlier decisions. This is **context rot**, and it's the primary failure mode when building anything beyond a single-session project.\n\n**Towline solves this.** It keeps your main orchestrator under ~15% context usage by delegating heavy work to fresh subagent contexts, each getting a clean 200k token window. All state lives on disk. Sessions are killable at any second without data loss. Whether you're on a free tier or Max 5x, wasted context means wasted budget, and context rot is the biggest source of waste.\n\n## Why Towline?\n\nMost AI coding tools treat context as infinite. They index your codebase, track your edits, and hope the model keeps up. That works for single-file changes. It falls apart when you're building something that takes days, spans dozens of files, and requires decisions made on Monday to still hold on Friday.\n\nTowline takes a different approach: **structured context isolation**. Instead of stuffing everything into one session, it delegates each operation to a fresh subagent with a clean 200k token window and coordinates through files on disk.\n\n<!-- TODO: Add demo GIF here showing /dev:begin → /dev:plan → /dev:build cycle -->\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What sets it apart</strong></summary>\n\n| Capability | IDE Assistants | Other Workflow Plugins | **Towline** |\n|:-----------|:--------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------:|\n| Context management | Indexing / tracking | Fresh subagent windows | Fresh 200k per agent + 15 lifecycle hooks enforcing budget |\n| Multi-phase projects | No structure | Phase-based | Phase + wave + milestone with crash-safe checkpoints |\n| Verification | Developer reviews diffs | Conversational UAT | Goal-backward: 3-layer checks against declared requirements |\n| Quality enforcement | Manual | CLI commands in agent context | Lifecycle hooks at zero token cost (automatic, not opt-in) |\n| Token efficiency | Uncontrolled | CLI toolkit loaded into every agent spawn | Zero agent-side overhead; hooks + CLI run outside context |\n| Cost control | N/A | One-size-fits-all pipeline | Depth profiles + model profiles: 2 spawns or 6, your choice |\n| State persistence | Lost on session end | File-based state | File-based + atomic writes + lockfile-protected mutations |\n| Parallelism | Up to 8 agents (Cursor) | Sequential | Dependency-aware wave-based parallelism |\n| Debugging | Ad-hoc | Ad-hoc agents on failure | Persistent hypothesis-driven sessions with evidence tracking |\n| Testing | Varies | Minimal | 758 tests, 36 suites, Windows/macOS/Linux CI |\n| Permissions | N/A | Often requires skip-permissions | Works within Claude Code's permission system |\n| Dashboard | IDE-native | None | Web UI with live updates via SSE |\n| Configurability | Opinionated | Limited | 12 config keys, 16+ feature toggles, depth/model profiles |\n\n<details>\n<summary>Key differentiators in detail</summary>\n\n**Goal-backward verification.** After a phase is built, a dedicated read-only verifier agent checks your actual codebase against declared must-haves. It doesn't ask \"did the tasks complete?\" It asks \"does the codebase now satisfy the requirements?\" Three layers: existence (file exists), substance (not a stub), wiring (connected to the system).\n\n**Lifecycle hooks.** Fifteen hook scripts fire on Claude Code events to enforce discipline automatically: commit format validation, plan structure checks, roadmap sync verification, context budget warnings before compaction, auto-chaining between workflow steps, subagent output validation, and session cleanup. No other tool polices itself this way.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism.** Plans declare dependencies. Plans with no conflicts run in parallel (same wave); dependent plans wait. This isn't \"throw 8 agents at it.\" It's structured, dependency-aware concurrent execution.\n\n**Kill-safe state.** Every piece of project state lives in `.planning/` on disk. You can kill your terminal mid-build, reboot your machine, come back a week later, and `/dev:resume` picks up exactly where you left off. No session state to lose.\n\n**Token-saving CLI.** A deterministic Node.js CLI handles mechanical operations (YAML parsing, state updates, must-have collection) so agents don't waste tokens on file parsing. Saves ~4,000-11,000 tokens per phase.\n\n**Zero agent-side overhead.** Some workflow tools load their entire CLI toolkit into every agent spawn, consuming thousands of tokens before the agent even starts working. Towline's approach is different: `towline-tools.js` runs only in hook scripts as Node.js processes, never inside agent context. Agents get clean 200k windows with nothing but the task at hand. This structural advantage compounds across every spawn in every workflow.\n\n**Lifecycle hooks, not CLI bloat.** Towline enforces workflow discipline through 15 Claude Code lifecycle hooks that fire automatically on events (commits, file writes, context compaction, agent spawns). Commit format validation, plan structure checks, dangerous command blocking, context budget warnings, all at zero orchestrator token cost. Other workflow tools embed these checks in CLI commands that agents must call explicitly, burning tokens for enforcement that should be free.\n\n**Configurable cost.** Most workflow plugins run the same full pipeline regardless of task complexity. Towline's depth profiles (`quick` / `standard` / `comprehensive`) let you match agent spawn count to the task. A simple config change means 2 agent spawns instead of 6. Same workflow guarantees, fraction of the cost. Pair with model profiles (`budget` / `balanced` / `quality`) for compound savings.\n\n**Systematic debugging.** `/dev:debug` provides hypothesis-driven investigation with persistent state across sessions. Each hypothesis is documented, tested, and recorded with evidence quality ratings. You can kill your terminal, come back days later, and resume exactly where you left off with every tested hypothesis and finding preserved. Most workflow tools have no dedicated debugging facility. They spawn ad-hoc agents on failures and hope for the best.\n\n**Tested like infrastructure.** Towline ships with 758 tests in 36 suites, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux in CI. Every hook script, every CLI command, every state management function is tested. When a tool manages your project's git history and development state, you want it tested like infrastructure, not like a weekend project with a single test file.\n\n**Works with permissions, not against them.** Towline integrates cleanly with Claude Code's permission system. You don't need `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or broad permission grants to use it effectively. Hook scripts handle enforcement; agents work within normal tool access boundaries.\n\n**Real-time dashboard.** A built-in web UI (`/dev:dashboard`) shows project state, phase progress, todos, and plan details with live updates via Server-Sent Events. Browse your `.planning/` state visually instead of reading markdown files.\n\n</details>\n</details>\n\n> **When to use Towline:** Multi-phase projects where quality matters. New features spanning 5+ files, large refactors, greenfield builds, anything that would take more than one Claude Code session to complete. Use `depth: quick` or `depth: standard` to control agent spawn count per phase.\n>\n> **When to skip it:** Single-file fixes, quick questions, one-off scripts. Use `/dev:quick` for atomic commits without full workflow overhead: single executor spawn, no research or verification agents.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Towline on different Claude Code plans</strong></summary>\n\n**Max 5x+ (recommended):** Full pipeline. Parallel research, multi-agent builds, comprehensive verification. Set `depth: comprehensive` for maximum thoroughness. Every token-saving feature (depth profiles, model profiles, CLI offloading) helps you do more within each usage window.\n\n**Max:** Towline works great here. Use `depth: standard` (the default) for a balanced pipeline. The structured workflow prevents the rework cycles that burn through quota. Building it right the first time costs less than debugging a messy result.\n\n**Pro / Free tiers:** Use `depth: quick` and lean on `/dev:quick` for most tasks: single executor spawn, atomic commits, state tracking. Skip `/dev:begin` (heavy) and instead manually create your `.planning/` structure with `/dev:setup`. Use `/dev:plan --skip-research` to plan without a research agent. Towline's file-based state and commit discipline are valuable at any tier, even when you can't afford multi-agent workflows.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Towline's `depth` setting is the primary cost lever. Lower tiers should start with `quick` and step up selectively. Higher tiers can run `comprehensive` and let Towline's token management handle the efficiency.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) 2.1.45+ &nbsp;(`claude --version`)\n- Node.js 18+\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\n# From your terminal\nclaude plugin marketplace add SienkLogic/towline\nclaude plugin install dev@towline\n\n# Or from inside a Claude Code session\n/plugin marketplace add SienkLogic/towline\n/plugin install dev@towline\n```\n\nAll `/dev:*` commands are now available globally.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Install scopes</strong></summary>\n\n| Scope | Command | Effect |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| **Global** (default) | `claude plugin install dev@towline` | Available in all projects |\n| **Project only** | `claude plugin install dev@towline --scope local` | This project only, gitignored |\n| **Team project** | `claude plugin install dev@towline --scope project` | Shared via git, teammates get prompted |\n\n</details>\n\n### Dashboard (Optional)\n\nTowline ships with a companion web dashboard for browsing your project's planning state in a browser. To set it up:\n\n```bash\n# One-time install of dashboard dependencies\nnpm run dashboard:install\n\n# Launch the dashboard for any project with a .planning/ directory\nnpm run dashboard -- --dir /path/to/your/project\n# Opens at http://127.0.0.1:3000\n```\n\nOr run directly:\n\n```bash\nnode dashboard/bin/cli.js --dir /path/to/your/project --port 3000\n```\n\n### Quick Start (Max / Max 5x)\n\nFull pipeline with parallel research and multi-agent builds. Best experience.\n\n```bash\ncd your-project && claude\n```\n```\n/dev:begin                # Towline asks about your project, researches the domain,\n                          # scopes requirements, and generates a phased roadmap\n\n/dev:plan 1               # Research + plan the first phase\n/dev:build 1              # Build it with parallel agents, atomic commits\n/dev:review 1             # Verify the codebase matches requirements\n/dev:plan 2               # Repeat for next phase\n```\n\nThat's the whole cycle. Everything lands in a `.planning/` directory. Kill your terminal anytime, `/dev:resume` picks up where you left off.\n\n### Quick Start (Pro / Free)\n\nLighter workflow that still gives you structured state tracking and clean commits.\n\n```bash\ncd your-project && claude\n```\n```\n/dev:setup                # Create .planning/ structure without the heavy research step\n/dev:plan 1 --skip-research   # Plan without spawning a research agent\n/dev:build 1              # Build it\n/dev:quick                # For one-off tasks: single agent, atomic commit, lowest cost\n```\n\nSet `depth: quick` in `/dev:config` to reduce agent spawns across all workflows.\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n| What you want | Command |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Start a new project | `/dev:begin` (or `/dev:setup` for lightweight init) |\n| Plan a phase | `/dev:plan 1` |\n| Build a phase | `/dev:build 1` |\n| Verify a phase | `/dev:review 1` |\n| Do something quick | `/dev:quick` |\n| See where you are | `/dev:status` |\n| Resume after restart | `/dev:resume` |\n| Auto-advance | `/dev:continue` |\n| Change settings | `/dev:config` |\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Philosophy</strong></summary>\n\n| Principle | What it means |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **Context is Currency** | Main orchestrator stays under 15-20% usage. Heavy lifting happens in fresh subagent contexts via `Task()`. The `depth` setting controls how many agents each workflow spawns, from minimal (`quick`) to full pipeline (`comprehensive`). |\n| **State > Memory** | If it isn't in `.planning/STATE.md`, it didn't happen. All project state lives on disk. |\n| **Fan-Out / Fan-In** | Spawn parallel agents for throughput, aggregate results back. Three researchers beats one running three times. |\n| **Trust but Verify** | A dedicated read-only verifier checks the actual codebase against requirements, not Claude's claims about it. |\n| **Build Houses, Don't Swat Flies** | The structured workflow pays off for complex multi-phase work. For simple tasks, `/dev:quick` skips the ceremony. |\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Platform Alignment</strong></summary>\n\nTowline is built on Claude Code's plugin API, not around it. As Claude Code evolves, Towline adopts native features rather than competing with them.\n\n| Towline feature | If Claude Code adds native equivalent | Towline response |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| File-based todos | Native task persistence | Migrate to thin wrapper |\n| Context budget tracking | Improved context compression | Keep as safety net, defer to native |\n| Auto-continue | Native workflow chaining | Adopt native, remove custom hook |\n| Goal-backward verification | — | Durable Towline value (no native equivalent) |\n| Wave-based parallelism | — | Durable Towline value (no native equivalent) |\n| Depth profiles | — | Durable Towline value (no native equivalent) |\n\n**Design principle:** Interface, don't replace. Features that Claude Code is likely to nativize are implemented as thin wrappers ready to migrate. Features that represent Towline's unique workflow layer (goal-backward verification, structured depth control, wave parallelism). That's where long-term investment goes.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n### Core Workflow\n\n| Command | Description | Agents |\n|---------|-------------|--------|\n| `/dev:begin` | Start a new project: questioning, research, requirements, roadmap | 4-6 (quick: 2-3) |\n| `/dev:plan <N>` | Plan a phase: research, plan creation, verification loop | 2-3 (quick: 1-2) |\n| `/dev:build <N>` | Build a phase: parallel execution in waves, atomic commits | 2-4 (quick: 1-2) |\n| `/dev:review <N>` | Verify a phase: automated 3-layer checks + conversational UAT | 1 |\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>All commands</strong></summary>\n\n### Planning & Discovery\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/dev:explore [topic]` | Explore ideas and think through approaches.

Data flows through files on disk, not through messages.\n\n```\nMain Session (~15% context)\n  │\n  ├── Task(researcher)  ──▶  writes .planning/research/\n  ├── Task(planner)     ──▶  writes PLAN.md files\n  ├── Task(executor)    ──▶  builds code, creates commits\n  ├── Task(executor)    ──▶  (parallel, same wave)\n  └── Task(verifier)    ──▶  checks codebase against must-haves\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Key Concepts</strong></summary>\n\n| Concept | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Context isolation** | Each subagent gets a fresh 200k context window. The orchestrator stays lean. |\n| **Goal-backward verification** | The verifier checks codebase reality against must-have declarations, not task completion. |\n| **Three-layer checks** | Every artifact is verified for existence, substantiveness (not a stub), and wiring (connected to the system). |\n| **Atomic commits** | Each task produces one commit: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): description` |\n| **Wave-based parallelism** | Plans in the same wave execute in parallel; waves execute sequentially. |\n| **Persistent state** | All project state lives in `.planning/` and survives context resets, session kills, and crashes. |\n| **Seeds** | `/dev:explore` can create seed files with trigger conditions that automatically inject into planning. |\n| **CLI tooling** | Deterministic Node.js CLI offloads mechanical parsing from agents, saving ~4,000-11,000 tokens per phase. |\n\n</details>\n\n### Token-Saving CLI\n\nTowline includes a Node.js CLI (`towline-tools.js`) that agents call to avoid wasting tokens on mechanical file parsing.
