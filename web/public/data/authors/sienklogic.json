As tokens accumulate during a long session, reasoning quality degrades, hallucinations increase, and the model starts losing track of earlier decisions. This is **context rot**, and it's the primary failure mode when building anything beyond a single-session project.\n\n**Plan-Build-Run solves this.** It keeps your main orchestrator under ~15% context usage by delegating heavy work to fresh subagent contexts, each getting a clean 200k token window. All state lives on disk. Sessions are killable at any second without data loss. Whether you're on a free tier or Max 5x, wasted context means wasted budget, and context rot is the biggest source of waste.\n\n## Why Plan-Build-Run?\n\nMost AI coding tools treat context as infinite. They index your codebase, track your edits, and hope the model keeps up. That works for single-file changes. It falls apart when you're building something that takes days, spans dozens of files, and requires decisions made on Monday to still hold on Friday.\n\nPlan-Build-Run takes a different approach: **structured context isolation**. Instead of stuffing everything into one session, it delegates each operation to a fresh subagent with a clean 200k token window and coordinates through files on disk.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/pbr-demo.gif\" alt=\"Plan-Build-Run workflow: begin → plan → build → review\" width=\"800\" />\n</p>\n\nGoal-backward verification, lifecycle hooks, wave-based parallelism, kill-safe state, and more. See **[What Sets It Apart](https://github.com/SienkLogic/plan-build-run/wiki/What-Sets-It-Apart)** for the full comparison and differentiators.\n\n> **When to use Plan-Build-Run:** Multi-phase projects where quality matters. New features spanning 5+ files, large refactors, greenfield builds, anything that would take more than one Claude Code session to complete. Use `depth: quick` or `depth: standard` to control agent spawn count per phase.\n>\n> **When to skip it:** Single-file fixes, quick questions, one-off scripts. Use `/pbr:quick` for atomic commits without full workflow overhead: single executor spawn, no research or verification agents.\n\nWorks on every Claude Code plan. Use `depth: quick` on Free/Pro, `depth: standard` on Max, `depth: comprehensive` on Max 5x. See **[What Sets It Apart](https://github.com/SienkLogic/plan-build-run/wiki/What-Sets-It-Apart#plan-build-run-on-different-claude-code-plans)** for tier-specific guidance.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) 2.1.45+ &nbsp;(`claude --version`)\n- Node.js 18+\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\n# From your terminal\nclaude plugin marketplace add SienkLogic/plan-build-run\nclaude plugin install pbr@plan-build-run\n\n# Or from inside a Claude Code session\n/plugin marketplace add SienkLogic/plan-build-run\n/plugin install pbr@plan-build-run\n```\n\nAll `/pbr:*` commands are now available globally.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Install scopes</strong></summary>\n\n| Scope | Command | Effect |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| **Global** (default) | `claude plugin install pbr@plan-build-run` | Available in all projects |\n| **Project only** | `claude plugin install pbr@plan-build-run --scope local` | This project only, gitignored |\n| **Team project** | `claude plugin install pbr@plan-build-run --scope project` | Shared via git, teammates get prompted |\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Install for Cursor IDE</strong></summary>\n\nPlan-Build-Run also works in Cursor. The setup script symlinks rules and agents into your project's `.cursor/` directory.\n\n**macOS / Linux:**\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\nbash /path/to/plan-build-run/plugins/cursor-pbr/setup.sh\n```\n\n**Windows (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\ncd C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\path\\to\\plan-build-run\\plugins\\cursor-pbr\\setup.ps1\n```\n\nBoth plugins share the same `.planning/` directory — start a project in Claude Code, continue in Cursor, or vice versa. See [`plugins/cursor-pbr/README.md`](plugins/cursor-pbr/README.md) for full details.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Install for GitHub Copilot CLI</strong></summary>\n\nPlan-Build-Run also works in GitHub Copilot CLI. The setup script installs PBR as a Copilot CLI plugin and symlinks agents into your project.\n\n**macOS / Linux:**\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\nbash /path/to/plan-build-run/plugins/copilot-pbr/setup.sh\n```\n\n**Windows (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\ncd C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\path\\to\\plan-build-run\\plugins\\copilot-pbr\\setup.ps1\n```\n\nAll three plugins share the same `.planning/` directory — start in any tool, continue in another. See [`plugins/copilot-pbr/README.md`](plugins/copilot-pbr/README.md) for full details.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Dashboard (Optional)</strong></summary>\n\nPlan-Build-Run ships with a companion web dashboard for browsing your project's planning state in a browser.\n\n```bash\n# One-time install of dashboard dependencies\nnpm run dashboard:install\n\n# Launch the dashboard (defaults to current directory)\nnpm run dashboard\n\n# Or specify a project directory and port\nnpm run dashboard -- --dir /path/to/your/project --port 3000\n```\n\nOr launch it directly from a Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot CLI session:\n```\n/pbr:dashboard\n```\n\nOpens at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` with live updates via SSE.\n\n</details>\n\n### Quick Start (Max / Max 5x)\n\nFull pipeline with parallel research and multi-agent builds. Best experience.\n\n```bash\ncd your-project && claude\n```\n```\n/pbr:begin                # Plan-Build-Run asks about your project, researches the domain,\n                          # scopes requirements, and generates a phased roadmap\n\n/pbr:plan 1               # Research + plan the first phase\n/pbr:build 1              # Build it with parallel agents, atomic commits\n/pbr:review 1             # Verify the codebase matches requirements\n/pbr:plan 2               # Repeat for next phase\n```\n\nThat's the whole cycle. Everything lands in a `.planning/` directory. Kill your terminal anytime, `/pbr:resume` picks up where you left off.\n\n### Quick Start (Pro / Free)\n\nLighter workflow that still gives you structured state tracking and clean commits.\n\n```bash\ncd your-project && claude\n```\n```\n/pbr:setup                # Create .planning/ structure without the heavy research step\n/pbr:plan 1 --skip-research   # Plan without spawning a research agent\n/pbr:build 1              # Build it\n/pbr:quick                # For one-off tasks: single agent, atomic commit, lowest cost\n```\n\nSet `depth: quick` in `/pbr:config` to reduce agent spawns across all workflows.\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n| What you want | Command |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Start a new project | `/pbr:begin` (or `/pbr:setup` for lightweight init) |\n| Plan a phase | `/pbr:plan 1` |\n| Build a phase | `/pbr:build 1` |\n| Verify a phase | `/pbr:review 1` |\n| Do something quick | `/pbr:quick` |\n| See where you are | `/pbr:status` |\n| Resume after restart | `/pbr:resume` |\n| Auto-advance | `/pbr:continue` |\n| Change settings | `/pbr:config` |\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n### Core Workflow\n\n| Command | Description | Agents |\n|---------|-------------|--------|\n| `/pbr:begin` | Start a new project: questioning, research, requirements, roadmap | 4-6 (quick: 2-3) |\n| `/pbr:plan <N>` | Plan a phase: research, plan creation, verification loop | 2-3 (quick: 1-2) |\n| `/pbr:build <N>` | Build a phase: parallel execution in waves, atomic commits | 2-4 (quick: 1-2) |\n| `/pbr:review <N>` | Verify a phase: automated 3-layer checks + conversational UAT | 1 |\n\nSee **[Commands](https://github.com/SienkLogic/plan-build-run/wiki/Commands)** for all 22 commands with flags, cost-by-depth tables, and detailed descriptions.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\nPlan-Build-Run is a **thin orchestrator** that delegates heavy work to fresh subagent contexts via `Task()`.

        "plugins/cursor-pbr/README.md": "# Plan-Build-Run for Cursor\n\nA structured development workflow plugin for Cursor that solves context rot through disciplined subagent delegation, file-based state, and goal-backward verification.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Automated Setup (Recommended)\n\nThe setup script creates symlinks from your project's `.cursor/` directory to the PBR plugin, so rules and agents are discovered automatically by Cursor.\n\n**macOS / Linux:**\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\nbash /path/to/plan-build-run/plugins/cursor-pbr/setup.sh\n```\n\n**Windows (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\ncd C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\path\\to\\plan-build-run\\plugins\\cursor-pbr\\setup.ps1\n```\n\nThis installs:\n- `.cursor/rules/pbr-workflow.mdc` — Workflow rules (auto-loaded when `.planning/` exists)\n- `.cursor/agents/*.md` — 10 specialized agent definitions\n\n### Manual Setup\n\nIf you prefer not to use the setup script:\n\n1. Copy or symlink `rules/pbr-workflow.mdc` into your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory\n2. Copy or symlink all files from `agents/` into your project's `.cursor/agents/` directory\n3. Skills (in `skills/`) are prompt templates — paste a skill's `SKILL.md` content into Cursor chat to invoke it, or reference the skill directory if Cursor supports skill discovery\n\n### Uninstall\n\nRemove the symlinks created by setup:\n\n```bash\nrm .cursor/rules/pbr-workflow.mdc\nrm .cursor/agents/*.md    # only PBR agent files\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe core workflow follows four steps per phase:\n\n```\n/pbr:begin     — Define your project: requirements, research, roadmap\n/pbr:plan 1    — Create a detailed plan for phase 1\n/pbr:build 1   — Execute the plan with atomic commits\n/pbr:review 1  — Verify the build matched the plan\n```\n\nRepeat `plan` / `build` / `review` for each phase in your roadmap.\n\n## Skills (21)\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| begin | Start a new project. Deep questioning, research, requirements, and roadmap. |\n| build | Execute all plans in a phase. Spawns agents to build in parallel, commits atomically. |\n| config | Configure settings: depth, model profiles, features, git, and gates. |\n| continue | Execute the next logical step automatically. No prompts, no decisions. |\n| debug | Systematic debugging with hypothesis testing. Persistent across sessions. |\n| discuss | Talk through a phase before planning. Identifies gray areas and captures decisions. |\n| explore | Explore ideas, think through approaches, and route insights to the right artifacts. |\n| health | Check planning directory integrity. Find and fix corrupted state. |\n| help | Command reference and workflow guide. |\n| import | Import external plans. Validates context, detects conflicts, generates PLAN.md. |\n| milestone | Manage milestones: new, complete, audit, gaps. |\n| note | Zero-friction idea capture. Append, list, or promote notes to todos. |\n| pause | Save your current session state for later resumption. |\n| plan | Create a detailed plan for a phase. Research, plan, and verify before building. |\n| quick | Execute an ad-hoc task with atomic commits. Skips full plan/review. |\n| resume | Pick up where you left off. Restores context and suggests next action. |\n| review | Verify the build matched the plan. Automated checks plus walkthrough. |\n| scan | Analyze an existing codebase. Maps structure, architecture, conventions, and concerns. |\n| setup | Onboarding wizard. Initialize project, select models, verify setup. |\n| status | Show current project status and suggest what to do next. |\n| todo | File-based persistent todos. Add, list, complete — survives sessions. |\n\nSkills live in `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. Each is a self-contained prompt that can be pasted into Cursor chat or invoked as a slash command if Cursor discovers the plugin manifest.\n\n## Agents (10)\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| codebase-mapper | Explores codebases and writes structured analysis across four focus areas. |\n| debugger | Systematic debugging using scientific method with hypothesis testing and evidence tracking. |\n| executor | Executes plan tasks with atomic commits, deviation handling, and self-verification. |\n| general | Lightweight agent for ad-hoc tasks that don't fit specialized roles. |\n| integration-checker | Cross-phase integration and E2E flow verification. |\n| plan-checker | Verifies plans will achieve phase goals before execution via goal-backward analysis. |\n| planner | Creates executable phase plans with task breakdown, dependency analysis, and wave assignment. |\n| researcher | Unified research agent for project domains and implementation approaches. |\n| synthesizer | Fast synthesis of multiple research outputs into coherent recommendations. |\n| verifier | Goal-backward phase verification against the real codebase. |\n\n## Configuration\n\nPlan-Build-Run stores all state in a `.planning/` directory at your project root:\n\n- `.planning/config.json` — Workflow settings (~62 properties across 12 keys)\n- `.planning/STATE.md` — Current position and status\n- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — Phase structure, goals, and dependencies\n- `.planning/phases/NN-slug/` — Per-phase plans, summaries, and verification reports\n\nRun `/pbr:config` to interactively adjust settings like depth, model profiles, and gate behavior.\n\n## Cross-Plugin Compatibility\n\nThis plugin works alongside the Claude Code version of Plan-Build-Run. Both plugins share the same `.planning/` directory and file formats, so you can switch between Cursor and Claude Code without losing state. Hook scripts under `plugins/pbr/scripts/` are shared between both plugins via relative paths.\n\n## Links\n\n- Repository: [https://github.com/SienkLogic/plan-build-run](https://github.com/SienkLogic/plan-build-run)\n- License: MIT\n"
