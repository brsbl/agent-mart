        "README.md": "# Creating Operational Skills\n\nA Claude Code skill for creating skills that transform knowledge into operational formats.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpx add-skill https://github.com/daralthus/creating-operational-skills\n```\n\nOr via Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add daralthus/creating-operational-skills\n/plugin install creating-operational-skills@operational-skills\n```\n\n## What is Operationalizing Knowledge?\n\n**Operationalizing is feature engineering for knowledge.**\n\nWhen you train a machine learning model, raw data often isn't directly useful. You transform it through feature engineering—extracting the signals that matter, reshaping them into formats the model can actually use.\n\nThe same principle applies to knowledge in LLM prompts. Raw principles, guidelines, and documentation are like raw data: they contain signal, but not in an immediately actionable form. An LLM reading \"ensure quality\" has to figure out what quality means in context. An LLM reading a checklist with specific verification steps can execute it directly.\n\n### The Problem with Raw Knowledge\n\nConsider this instruction:\n\n> \"Write good commit messages that are clear and follow best practices.\"\n\nClaude knows what good commit messages look like in general. But:\n- What's \"clear\" in *your* codebase?\n- Which best practices matter to *your* team?\n- How do you handle edge cases?\n\nThe instruction is too abstract to produce consistent results.\n\n### Operational Formats as Affordances\n\nOperational formats—workflows, decision trees, checklists, templates, rubrics—provide **affordances** that make knowledge directly usable:\n\n| Format | What it does | When to use |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Workflow** | Sequential steps | Process is linear |\n| **Decision tree** | Branching logic | Choices depend on conditions |\n| **Checklist** | Binary verification | Things get forgotten |\n| **Template** | Fill-in structure | Output needs consistent shape |\n| **Rubric** | Quality criteria | Judgment is subjective |\n| **Selector table** | Situation → action mapping | Choices are enumerable |\n\nA decision tree for \"which testing approach?\" gives Claude clear paths. A checklist for \"is this commit ready?\" gives Claude specific things to verify. A template for \"write a bug report\" gives Claude exact fields to fill.\n\n### Why This Matters for Coding CLIs\n\nLLM-powered coding tools like Claude Code operate in a tight loop: understand context → make decisions → take actions → verify results. Each step benefits from operational formats:\n\n- **Understanding context**: Selector tables map situations to relevant approaches\n- **Making decisions**: Decision trees provide explicit branching logic\n- **Taking actions**: Workflows sequence the steps correctly\n- **Verifying results**: Checklists and rubrics define \"done\"\n\nWithout these, the LLM falls back to general knowledge, which may not match your specific requirements, conventions, or constraints.\n\n### Not Everything Needs Operationalizing\n\nProse works fine for:\n- Background context Claude needs to understand the domain\n- Flexible guidance where multiple approaches are valid\n- Explanations of *why* (the operational format handles *what*)\n\nOperationalize when you see:\n- Inconsistent outputs despite clear intent\n- Wrong decisions at choice points\n- Missed steps or quality issues\n- Processes that need to be repeatable\n\n## Skill Contents\n\n```\nskills/creating-operational-skills/\n├── SKILL.md                           # Main skill instructions\n└── references/\n    ├── SKILL_STRUCTURE.md             # File structure, frontmatter, naming\n    ├── BEST_PRACTICES.md              # Authoring guidelines, patterns based on Anthropic's best practices\n    └── OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md           # Catalog of operational formats\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, Claude will use this skill when you ask to:\n- Create a new skill\n- Make a skill\n- Automate a workflow as a skill\n- Build operational instructions for existing skills\n\nThe skill guides you through:\n1. Identifying the workflow to encode\n2. Creating the skill structure\n3. Choosing appropriate operational formats\n4. Writing effective descriptions for discovery\n5.

What inputs/outputs? What references needed?\n2. **Create folder** - `mkdir -p .claude/skills/<skill-name>/references`\n3. **Write SKILL.md** - Keep under 500 lines, point to references\n4. **Create reference files** - Split long content, add Contents sections\n5. **Apply feature engineering** - Transform principles into usable formats ([OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md](references/OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md))\n6. **Add scripts** - Place in `scripts/` folder if needed\n7. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add to Skills table\n8. **Iterate with feedback** - Test, get user feedback, improve\n\n## Iteration\n\nSkills improve through use. After creating:\n\n1. **Test with real tasks** - Does Claude use the skill? Does output meet expectations?\n2. **Get user feedback** - Where did it fall short? What was confusing?\n3. **Identify failure modes** - Generic output? Wrong decisions? Missed steps?\n4. **Apply fixes**\n5. **Repeat** - Skills evolve; first version is rarely final\n",
        "skills/creating-operational-skills/references/BEST_PRACTICES.md": "# Skill Authoring Best Practices\n\nSource: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices (2025-12-01)\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Core Principles](#core-principles)\n- [Setting Degrees of Freedom](#setting-degrees-of-freedom)\n- [Writing Effective Descriptions](#writing-effective-descriptions)\n- [Progressive Disclosure Patterns](#progressive-disclosure-patterns)\n- [Workflows and Feedback Loops](#workflows-and-feedback-loops)\n- [Content Guidelines](#content-guidelines)\n- [Common Patterns](#common-patterns)\n- [Anti-Patterns to Avoid](#anti-patterns-to-avoid)\n- [Checklist](#checklist)\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Your Skill shares it with system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual request.\n\n**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart. Only add context Claude doesn't have.\n\nChallenge each piece of information:\n- \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\"\n- \"Can I assume Claude knows this?\"\n- \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\n**Good** (~50 tokens):\n```markdown\n## Extract PDF text\nUse pdfplumber for text extraction:\n\\`\\`\\`python\nimport pdfplumber\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n**Bad** (~150 tokens):\n```markdown\nPDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains\ntext, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to\nuse a library. There are many libraries available...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Setting Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch specificity to the task's fragility and variability.\n\n### High freedom (text-based instructions)\n\nUse when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context.\n\n```markdown\n## Code review process\n1. Analyze the code structure and organization\n2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases\n3. Suggest improvements for readability\n4. Verify adherence to project conventions\n```\n\n### Medium freedom (pseudocode/scripts with parameters)\n\nUse when a preferred pattern exists but some variation is acceptable.\n\n```markdown\n## Generate report\nUse this template and customize as needed:\n\\`\\`\\`python\ndef generate_report(data, format=\"markdown\", include_charts=True):\n    # Process data\n    # Generate output in specified format\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)\n\nUse when operations are fragile, consistency is critical, specific sequence required.\n\n```markdown\n## Database migration\nRun exactly this script:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\npython scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup\n\\`\\`\\`\nDo not modify the command or add additional flags.\n```\n\n**Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:\n- **Narrow bridge with cliffs**: Only one safe way. Provide exact instructions.\n- **Open field**: Many paths work. Give general direction.\n\n---\n\n## Writing Effective Descriptions\n\nThe description enables Skill discovery. Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available.\n\n### Rules\n\n**Always write in third person** (description is injected into system prompt):\n- ✓ \"Processes Excel files and generates reports\"\n- ✗ \"I can help you process Excel files\"\n- ✗ \"You can use this to process Excel files\"\n\n**Be specific and include key terms**:\n\n✓ Good:\n```yaml\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.\n```\n\n✗ Bad:\n```yaml\ndescription: Helps with documents\n```\n\n---\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nSKILL.md serves as an overview pointing to detailed materials. Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines.\n\n### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n\\`\\`\\`python\nimport pdfplumber\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"file.pdf\") as pdf:\n    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Advanced features\n**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md)\n**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    └── product.md (API usage, features)\n```\n\n### Pattern 3: Conditional details\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n```\n\n### Avoid deeply nested references\n\nKeep references one level deep from SKILL.md.\n\n✗ Bad:\n```\nSKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md → actual information\n```\n\n✓ Good:\n```\nSKILL.md → advanced.md (complete info)\nSKILL.md → reference.md (complete info)\n```\n\n### Structure longer files with table of contents\n\nFor files >100 lines, include contents at top:\n\n```markdown\n# API Reference\n\n## Contents\n- Authentication and setup\n- Core methods (create, read, update, delete)\n- Advanced features\n- Error handling patterns\n- Code examples\n\n## Authentication and setup\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Workflows and Feedback Loops\n\n### Use workflows for complex tasks\n\nBreak into clear, sequential steps. Provide checklist for complex workflows:\n\n```markdown\n## PDF form filling workflow\n\nCopy this checklist:\n\\`\\`\\`\nTask Progress:\n- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)\n- [ ] Step 2: Create field mapping (edit fields.json)\n- [ ] Step 3: Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)\n- [ ] Step 4: Fill the form (run fill_form.py)\n- [ ] Step 5: Verify output (run verify_output.py)\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Implement feedback loops\n\n**Common pattern**: Run validator → fix errors → repeat\n\n```markdown\n## Document editing process\n1. Make edits to `word/document.xml`\n2. **Validate immediately**: `python scripts/validate.py unpacked_dir/`\n3. If validation fails:\n   - Review error message\n   - Fix issues\n   - Run validation again\n4. **Only proceed when validation passes**\n5. Rebuild: `python scripts/pack.py unpacked_dir/ output.docx`\n```\n\n---\n\n## Content Guidelines\n\n### Avoid time-sensitive information\n\n✗ Bad:\n```markdown\nIf you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.\n```\n\n✓ Good:\n```markdown\n## Current method\nUse the v2 API endpoint.\n\n## Old patterns\n<details>\n<summary>Legacy v1 API (deprecated 2025-08)</summary>\nThe v1 API used: `api.example.com/v1/messages`\n</details>\n```\n\n### Use consistent terminology\n\nChoose one term and use it throughout:\n- ✓ Always \"API endpoint\" (not mix of \"URL\", \"API route\", \"path\")\n- ✓ Always \"field\" (not mix of \"box\", \"element\", \"control\")\n\n---\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Template pattern\n\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template structure:\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\n# [Analysis Title]\n\n## Executive summary\n[One-paragraph overview]\n\n## Key findings\n- Finding 1 with supporting data\n- Finding 2 with supporting data\n\n## Recommendations\n1. Specific actionable recommendation\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Examples pattern\n\nProvide input/output pairs:\n\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput:\n\\`\\`\\`\nfeat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\nAdd login endpoint and token validation middleware\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly\nOutput:\n\\`\\`\\`\nfix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Conditional workflow pattern\n\n```markdown\n## Document modification workflow\n\n1. Determine the modification type:\n   **Creating new content?** → Follow \"Creation workflow\"\n   **Editing existing content?** → Follow \"Editing workflow\"\n\n2. Creation workflow:\n   - Use docx-js library\n   - Build document from scratch\n\n3. Editing workflow:\n   - Unpack existing document\n   - Modify XML directly\n   - Validate after each change\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### Windows-style paths\n- ✓ `scripts/helper.py`\n- ✗ `scripts\\helper.py`\n\n### Too many options\n✗ Bad: \"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image...\"\n\n✓ Good: \"Use pdfplumber for text extraction. For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead.\"\n\n---\n\n## Checklist\n\n### Core quality\n- [ ] Description is specific and includes key terms\n- [ ] Description includes both what and when\n- [ ] SKILL.md body under 500 lines\n- [ ] Additional details in separate files\n- [ ] No time-sensitive information\n- [ ] Consistent terminology\n- [ ] Concrete examples\n- [ ] File references one level deep\n- [ ] Progressive disclosure used\n- [ ] Workflows have clear steps\n\n### Code and scripts\n- [ ] Scripts solve problems (don't punt to Claude)\n- [ ] Error handling is explicit\n- [ ] No \"voodoo constants\" (all values justified)\n- [ ] Required packages listed\n- [ ] No Windows-style paths\n- [ ] Validation steps for critical operations\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Tested with real usage scenarios\n- [ ] Works across intended models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)\n",

Gather inputs\n2. Run analysis\n3. Draft output\n4. Review\n5. Finalize\n```\n\n**Recipe** - Steps with legitimate variations.\n\n```\nINGREDIENTS: insight, supporting points, example\nSTEPS: 1. Write insight... 2. List points... 3. Draft...\nVARIATIONS: story-first, contrarian, how-to\n```\n\n**State machine** - Process with memory.

Ask: \"What problem?\" → If vague, ask for example\n2. Ask: \"What have you tried?\" → If nothing, suggest starting points\n3. Based on answers, choose path...\n```\n\n### Decision tools\n\n**Decision tree** - Branching logic for choosing.\n\n```\nIs condition A?\n├─ Yes → Do X\n└─ No → Do Y\n```\n\n**Selector table** - Enumerated situations mapped to actions.\n\n| Situation | Action | Why |\n|-----------|--------|-----|\n| A | Do X | Reason |\n| B | Do Y | Reason |\n\n**Comparison matrix** - Multi-factor trade-off analysis.\n\n| Option | Speed | Complexity | Fit |\n|--------|-------|------------|-----|\n| A | Fast | High | Partial |\n| B | Slow | Low | Best |\n\nDECISION RULE: If speed critical → A.

As output format: ensures shape. As thinking step: forces you to work through each field.\n\n```\nFIELD 1: _______________________\nFIELD 2: _______________________\nDERIVED OUTPUT: ________________\n```\n\n**Grammar** - Formal structure definition. As output format: enforces rules. As thinking step: you produce by following the rules.\n\n```\nPOST := HOOK BODY CLOSE\nHOOK := short_sentence (≤10 words)\nBODY := paragraph{1,5}\n```\n\n**Persona card** - Voice/character attributes.\n\n```\nSTATUS: 7/10 (confident but not lecturing)\nAVOIDS: Hedging, over-explaining\nSOUNDS LIKE: \"Here's what actually happened...\"\n```\n\n### Reasoning tools\n\n**Worked example** - Input + reasoning + output. Shows thinking.\n\n```\nINPUT: \"Tried three caching strategies, Redis was fastest\"\nREASONING: What's surprising? They tried three - implies not obvious.\nOUTPUT: \"Benchmark your caching layer - obvious choice wasn't fastest\"\n```\n\n**Replacement rules** - Pattern → fix mappings for editing.\n\n| Pattern | Replace | Why |\n|---------|---------|-----|\n| \"I think that...\" | [delete] | Throat-clearing |\n| passive voice | active | Directness |\n\n**Self-interrogation** - Questions to counter biases.\n\n```\nBefore: What do I assume? Who would disagree?\nAfter: Would I say this to a friend? Where am I performing?\n```\n\n## Creating tools\n\n1. **Identify candidates** - Scan principles for patterns:\n   - Sequential steps → workflow/recipe\n   - Branching logic → decision tree\n   - Enumerable choices → selector\n   - Verification needs → checklist\n   - Quality judgment → rubric\n   - Structure requirements → template\n   - Voice consistency → persona\n\n2. **Convert selectively** - Not everything needs to be a tool. If prose works, keep prose.\n\n3. **Test with real examples** - Can you complete it without ambiguity? Does it produce better output than freeform?\n\n## Anti-patterns\n\n**Tool that's really documentation**: \"Consider whether...\" - if it can't be concrete, leave as prose.\n\n**Checklist with vague items**: \"Good quality\" - either make specific or leave as guidance.\n\n**Template without blanks**: Just showing structure isn't a template.

Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on request context and the Skill's description.\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Extend Claude's capabilities for specific workflows\n- Share expertise across team via git\n- Reduce repetitive prompting\n- Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks\n\n---\n\n## File Structure\n\n### Basic structure\n\n```\n.claude/skills/<skill-name>/\n└── SKILL.md              # Required - main instructions\n```\n\n### With references\n\n```\n.claude/skills/<skill-name>/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required\n└── references/\n    ├── GUIDE.md          # Detailed instructions\n    ├── TEMPLATES.md      # Output templates\n    └── source.xlsx       # Symlink to source file\n```\n\n### With scripts\n\n```\n.claude/skills/<skill-name>/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── references/\n│   └── ...\n└── scripts/\n    ├── helper.py\n    └── validate.py\n```\n\n### Complete example\n\n```\npdf-processing/\n├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions (loaded when triggered)\n├── FORMS.md              # Form-filling guide (loaded as needed)\n├── reference.md          # API reference (loaded as needed)\n├── examples.md           # Usage examples (loaded as needed)\n└── scripts/\n    ├── analyze_form.py   # Utility script (executed, not loaded)\n    ├── fill_form.py\n    └── validate.py\n```\n\n---\n\n## YAML Frontmatter\n\nRequired fields at top of SKILL.md:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it.\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n[Content starts here]\n```\n\n### name field\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Maximum 64 characters\n- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only\n- Cannot contain XML tags\n- Cannot contain reserved words: \"anthropic\", \"claude\"\n\n### description field\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Must be non-empty\n- Maximum 1024 characters\n- Cannot contain XML tags\n- Should describe what AND when\n\n**Critical for discovery**: Claude uses description to choose from potentially 100+ Skills.\n\n---\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\nUse **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for clarity:\n\n✓ Good (gerund form):\n- `processing-pdfs`\n- `analyzing-spreadsheets`\n- `managing-databases`\n- `testing-code`\n- `writing-documentation`\n\nAcceptable alternatives:\n- Noun phrases: `pdf-processing`, `spreadsheet-analysis`\n- Action-oriented: `process-pdfs`, `analyze-spreadsheets`\n\n✗ Avoid:\n- Vague: `helper`, `utils`, `tools`\n- Generic: `documents`, `data`, `files`\n- Reserved: `anthropic-helper`, `claude-tools`\n\n---\n\n## Skill Locations\n\n### Personal Skills\n\nAvailable across all projects. Store in `~/.claude/skills/`:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill-name\n```\n\nUse for:\n- Individual workflows and preferences\n- Experimental Skills in development\n- Personal productivity tools\n\n### Project Skills\n\nShared with team. Store in `.claude/skills/` within project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill-name\n```\n\nUse for:\n- Team workflows and conventions\n- Project-specific expertise\n- Shared utilities and scripts\n\nProject Skills are checked into git and automatically available to team.\n\n---\n\n## Supporting Files\n\n### Reference files\n\nFor detailed documentation that shouldn't clutter SKILL.md:\n\n```markdown\n# In SKILL.md\n## References\n- [GUIDE.md](references/GUIDE.md) - Detailed instructions\n- [TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md) - Output templates\n```\n\nClaude reads these only when needed (progressive disclosure).\n\nFor transforming principles into more usable formats (workflows, decision trees, checklists, templates, etc.), see [OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md](OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md).\n\n### Scripts\n\nPlace utility scripts in `scripts/` folder:\n\n```markdown\n# In SKILL.md\n## Scripts\n- `scripts/extract.py` - Extract data from source\n- `scripts/validate.py` - Validate output format\n\nRun extraction:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nuv run python3 -u .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/extract.py\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Skill (single file)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: generating-commit-messages\ndescription: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.\n---\n\n# Generating Commit Messages\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes\n2. Suggest commit message with:\n   - Summary under 50 characters\n   - Detailed description\n   - Affected components\n\n## Best practices\n\n- Use present tense\n- Explain what and why, not how\n```\n\n### Skill with references\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: writing-reports\ndescription: Write structured reports following company templates. Use when creating reports, analyses, or documentation.\n---\n\n# Writing Reports\n\n## References\n\n- [TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md) - Report templates\n- [STYLE_GUIDE.md](references/STYLE_GUIDE.md) - Writing standards\n\n## Process\n\n1. Determine report type\n2. Use appropriate template from [TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md)\n3. Follow style guide\n4. Save to `${OUTPUT_DIR}/`\n```\n\n### Skill with scripts\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: extracting-data\ndescription: Extract structured data from Excel files into JSON. Use when processing spreadsheets or converting Excel to JSON.\n---\n\n# Extracting Data\n\n## Scripts\n\nLocated in `scripts/`:\n- `extract.py` - Main extraction script\n- `validate.py` - Validate output JSON\n\n## Process\n\n1. Examine source file structure\n2. Run extraction:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   uv run python3 -u .claude/skills/extracting-data/scripts/extract.py\n   \\`\\`\\`\n3. Validate output:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   uv run python3 -u .claude/skills/extracting-data/scripts/validate.py\n   \\`\\`\\`\n4. Save to `${OUTPUT_DIR}/`\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Skills\n\nAfter creating, test by asking questions that match your description:\n\n```\nCan you help me extract text from this PDF?\n```\n\nClaude autonomously decides to use the Skill based on context.\n\n### Debug tips\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your Skill:\n1. **Check description** - Is it specific enough? Include trigger words.\n2. **Verify file path** - Must be in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`\n3. **Check YAML syntax** - Opening/closing `---`, valid YAML\n4. **Restart Claude Code** - Changes take effect on restart\n"
