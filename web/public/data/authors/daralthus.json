        "README.md": "# Creating Operational Skills\n\nA Claude Code skill for creating skills that transform knowledge into operational formats.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpx add-skill https://github.com/daralthus/creating-operational-skills\n```\n\nOr via Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add daralthus/creating-operational-skills\n/plugin install creating-operational-skills@operational-skills\n```\n\n## What is Operationalizing Knowledge?\n\n**Operationalizing is feature engineering for knowledge.**\n\nWhen you train a machine learning model, raw data often isn't directly useful. You transform it through feature engineering—extracting the signals that matter, reshaping them into formats the model can actually use.\n\nThe same principle applies to knowledge in LLM prompts. Raw principles, guidelines, and documentation are like raw data: they contain signal, but not in an immediately actionable form. An LLM reading \"ensure quality\" has to figure out what quality means in context. An LLM reading a checklist with specific verification steps can execute it directly.\n\n### The Problem with Raw Knowledge\n\nConsider this instruction:\n\n> \"Write good commit messages that are clear and follow best practices.\"\n\nClaude knows what good commit messages look like in general. But:\n- What's \"clear\" in *your* codebase?\n- Which best practices matter to *your* team?\n- How do you handle edge cases?\n\nThe instruction is too abstract to produce consistent results.\n\n### Operational Formats as Affordances\n\nOperational formats—workflows, decision trees, checklists, templates, rubrics—provide **affordances** that make knowledge directly usable:\n\n| Format | What it does | When to use |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Workflow** | Sequential steps | Process is linear |\n| **Decision tree** | Branching logic | Choices depend on conditions |\n| **Checklist** | Binary verification | Things get forgotten |\n| **Template** | Fill-in structure | Output needs consistent shape |\n| **Rubric** | Quality criteria | Judgment is subjective |\n| **Selector table** | Situation → action mapping | Choices are enumerable |\n\nA decision tree for \"which testing approach?\" gives Claude clear paths. A checklist for \"is this commit ready?\" gives Claude specific things to verify. A template for \"write a bug report\" gives Claude exact fields to fill.\n\n### Why This Matters for Coding CLIs\n\nLLM-powered coding tools like Claude Code operate in a tight loop: understand context → make decisions → take actions → verify results. Each step benefits from operational formats:\n\n- **Understanding context**: Selector tables map situations to relevant approaches\n- **Making decisions**: Decision trees provide explicit branching logic\n- **Taking actions**: Workflows sequence the steps correctly\n- **Verifying results**: Checklists and rubrics define \"done\"\n\nWithout these, the LLM falls back to general knowledge, which may not match your specific requirements, conventions, or constraints.\n\n### Not Everything Needs Operationalizing\n\nProse works fine for:\n- Background context Claude needs to understand the domain\n- Flexible guidance where multiple approaches are valid\n- Explanations of *why* (the operational format handles *what*)\n\nOperationalize when you see:\n- Inconsistent outputs despite clear intent\n- Wrong decisions at choice points\n- Missed steps or quality issues\n- Processes that need to be repeatable\n\n## Skill Contents\n\n```\nskills/creating-operational-skills/\n├── SKILL.md                           # Main skill instructions\n└── references/\n    ├── SKILL_STRUCTURE.md             # File structure, frontmatter, naming\n    ├── BEST_PRACTICES.md              # Authoring guidelines, patterns based on Anthropic's best practices\n    └── OPERATIONAL_TOOLS.md           # Catalog of operational formats\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, Claude will use this skill when you ask to:\n- Create a new skill\n- Make a skill\n- Automate a workflow as a skill\n- Build operational instructions for existing skills\n\nThe skill guides you through:\n1. Identifying the workflow to encode\n2. Creating the skill structure\n3. Choosing appropriate operational formats\n4. Writing effective descriptions for discovery\n5. Testing and iterating\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n"
