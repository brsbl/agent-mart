        "README.md": "# Catalyst - Claude Code Workspace\n\n[Ryan Rozich's](https://ryanrozich.bio/) personal development workflow for Claude Code, now open\nsourced and packaged as a Claude Code plugin marketplace.\n\nThis is the workspace I use daily for AI-assisted development. It's battle-tested on real projects\nand optimized for efficient, context-aware AI collaboration. I'm sharing it so others can use it,\nfork it, and contribute ideas back.\n\n## Tech Stack & Integrations\n\nCatalyst integrates with your development tools through both **CLI-based** (token-efficient) and **MCP-based** (richer features) approaches:\n\n### Project Management & Issue Tracking\n- **Linear** - Issue tracking, sprint planning, ticket lifecycle (CLI via [Linearis](https://github.com/ryanrozich/linearis))\n  - `catalyst-dev`: Core research agents and workflow commands\n  - `catalyst-pm`: Advanced PM workflows (cycle analysis, milestone tracking, backlog grooming)\n\n### Version Control & Code Hosting\n- **GitHub** - Pull requests, code review, repository management (CLI via `gh`)\n  - `catalyst-dev`: PR creation, branch management, worktree workflows\n\n### Error Monitoring & Debugging\n- **Sentry** - Production error monitoring, stack traces, root cause analysis (MCP + CLI)\n  - `catalyst-debugging`: Sentry MCP integration (~20k tokens when enabled)\n  - Supports single-project and multi-project configurations\n\n### Deployment & Infrastructure\n- **Railway** - Deployment logs, service health, environment variables (CLI via `railway`)\n  - `catalyst-dev`: Railway research agent for deployment investigation\n\n### Product Analytics\n- **PostHog** - User behavior, conversion funnels, feature analytics (MCP)\n  - `catalyst-analytics`: PostHog MCP integration (~40k tokens when enabled)\n\n### Documentation & Code Search\n- **Context7** - Library documentation lookup (MCP, ~2k tokens)\n  - `catalyst-dev`: Built-in, always available\n- **DeepWiki** - GitHub repository documentation (MCP, ~1.5k tokens)\n  - `catalyst-dev`: Built-in, always available\n- **Exa** - Web research and external documentation (API)\n  - `catalyst-dev`: External research agent\n\n### Thoughts & Memory System\n- **HumanLayer** - Persistent memory, shared context, team collaboration (CLI via `humanlayer`)\n  - All plugins: Foundation for research, plans, handoffs, and reports\n\n### Token Efficiency Strategy\n\n**Why CLI + lightweight MCP?** Most development sessions don't need heavy integrations:\n\n- Start with `catalyst-dev` (~3.5k tokens): Core workflow + Linear + GitHub + Railway\n- Enable `catalyst-analytics` when analyzing user behavior (~+40k tokens)\n- Enable `catalyst-debugging` when investigating production errors (~+20k tokens)\n- Disable when done to free context for code and conversation\n\nThis keeps your typical session lean while having powerful tools available when needed.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n**Catalyst** is a 5-plugin system for Claude Code focused on **token efficiency**, **session-aware\nMCP management**, and **persistent context** through parallel agent research, structured handoffs,\nand shared memory systems.\n\n**catalyst-dev** (Core - Always enabled)\n\n- 11 research agents (codebase + infrastructure)\n- 18 commands covering full dev lifecycle\n- Linear integration via Linearis CLI\n- Handoff system for context persistence\n- ~3.5k context (lightweight MCPs: DeepWiki, Context7)\n\n**catalyst-pm** (Optional - Enable for project management)\n\n- Linear-focused project management workflows\n- 5 commands: analyze-cycle, analyze-milestone, report-daily, groom-backlog, sync-prs\n- Research-first architecture (Haiku for data, Sonnet for analysis)\n- 5 specialized agents: linear-research, cycle-analyzer, milestone-analyzer, backlog-analyzer, github-linear-analyzer\n- Cycle management and milestone tracking with target date feasibility\n- Actionable insights and recommendations (not just data dumps)\n\n**catalyst-analytics** (Optional - Enable when needed)\n\n- PostHog MCP integration (~40k context)\n- Product analytics and user behavior analysis\n- Conversion funnels and cohort analysis\n- 3 specialized analytics commands\n\n**catalyst-debugging** (Optional - Enable when needed)\n\n- Sentry MCP integration (~20k context)\n- Production error monitoring and debugging\n- Stack trace analysis and root cause detection\n- 3 specialized debugging commands\n\n**catalyst-meta** (Optional - For advanced users)\n\n- Discover workflows from community repos\n- Import and adapt patterns\n- Create new workflows\n\n## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)\n\nGet started in 5 minutes with the unified setup script:\n\n```bash\n# Download the setup script\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst/main/setup-catalyst.sh\nchmod +x setup-catalyst.sh\n\n# Run it (requires interactive input)\n./setup-catalyst.sh\n```\n\nThis script will guide you through:\n- ✅ Prerequisites check and installation (HumanLayer CLI, jq, etc.)\n- ✅ Thoughts repository setup (one per org, backed up to GitHub)\n- ✅ Project configuration (ticket prefix, project name)\n- ✅ Integration setup (Linear, Sentry, Railway, PostHog, Exa)\n- ✅ Worktree directory creation\n- ✅ HumanLayer thoughts initialization and syncing\n\n**Then install the plugins:**\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code:\n/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst\n/plugin install catalyst-dev\n\n# Restart Claude Code\n```\n\nYou're ready! Try `/research-codebase` in your next session.\n\nSee [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.\n\n## Installation\n\nAlternatively, install plugins manually via Claude Code plugin system:\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace repository\n/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst\n\n# Install core workflow (required)\n/plugin install catalyst-dev\n\n# Optional: Install PM plugin (Linear project management)\n/plugin install catalyst-pm\n\n# Optional: Install analytics plugin (if you use PostHog)\n/plugin install catalyst-analytics\n\n# Optional: Install debugging plugin (if you use Sentry)\n/plugin install catalyst-debugging\n\n# Optional: Install meta plugin (workflow discovery)\n/plugin install catalyst-meta\n```\n\n### Session-Based MCP Management\n\nPlugins automatically load/unload MCPs when enabled/disabled:\n\n```bash\n# Enable PM tools for sprint planning and cycle reviews\n/plugin enable catalyst-pm  # Lightweight CLI-based, minimal context\n\n# Enable analytics when analyzing user behavior\n/plugin enable catalyst-analytics  # Loads PostHog MCP (+40k context)\n\n# Disable when done to free context\n/plugin disable catalyst-analytics  # Unloads PostHog MCP (-40k context)\n\n# Enable debugging for incident response\n/plugin enable catalyst-debugging  # Loads Sentry MCP (+20k context)\n\n# Can enable multiple plugins simultaneously\n/plugin enable catalyst-pm catalyst-analytics catalyst-debugging\n```\n\n**Why this matters**: Most development sessions don't need analytics or debugging MCPs. Starting\nwith just `catalyst-dev` keeps your context at ~3.5k tokens instead of ~65k, leaving more room for\ncode and conversation.\n\n### Updating Plugins\n\nKeep your Catalyst plugins up to date with bug fixes and new features:\n\n```bash\n# Update the marketplace to fetch latest from GitHub\nclaude plugin marketplace update catalyst\n\n# Restart Claude Code to load updated plugins\n# (Exit and reopen, or start a new session)\n```\n\n**When to update:**\n- 🐛 **Bug fixes**: Patch versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 3.0.1) - Fix issues like incorrect CLI syntax\n- ✨ **New features**: Minor versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 3.1.0) - New commands or capabilities\n- 🔄 **Breaking changes**: Major versions (e.g., 3.0.0 → 4.0.0) - May require configuration updates\n\n**Important:** A restart is required for plugin updates to take effect. Active sessions use the old version until you restart Claude Code.\n\n**Check your versions:**\n```bash\n# List installed plugins and their versions\n/plugin list\n```\n\n**Need help?**\n\n- [Installation & Configuration Guide](QUICKSTART.md) - Complete setup, installation, and configuration\n- [Claude Code Plugin Guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins.md) - Official plugin documentation\n\n## Complete Workflow\n\n```\n/research-codebase → /create-plan → /implement-plan → /validate-plan → /create-pr → /merge-pr\n```\n\nWith handoffs for context persistence:\n\n```\n/create-handoff → /resume-handoff\n```\n\nAgents proactively monitor context during implementation and will prompt you to create handoffs\nbefore running out of context, creating structured handoff documents that add to persistent memory.\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n- [Agentic Workflow Guide](docs/AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) - Complete guide showing research,\n  planning, handoff, worktree, implementation, verify, and PR workflows\n- [Context Engineering](docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md) - Token efficiency strategies and context\n  management patterns\n- [Linear Workflow Automation](docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION.md) - Linearis integration for ticket\n  → branch → PR → merge lifecycle ([Linearis GitHub](https://github.com/ryanrozich/linearis))\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n### Token Efficiency Through Structured Context\n\n1. **Parallel Agent Research** - Multiple specialized agents research concurrently\n2. **Context Compression** - Research compressed into structured summaries\n3. **Focused Planning** - Planning agents work with compressed context\n4. **Persistent Memory** - Handoffs and thoughts system preserve context across sessions\n\n### Reusability and Shared Memory\n\nUses the [HumanLayer thoughts system](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer) for shared\npersistent memory across teams and projects. The research → plan → implement → validate workflow is\nadapted from HumanLayer's approach.\n\n### CLI-First Integration\n\nWhen possible, uses CLIs instead of MCPs for token efficiency:\n\n- Linear: Linearis CLI (1k tokens) vs Linear MCP (13k tokens) = **13x reduction**\n- Infrastructure research via CLIs (Railway, Sentry, GitHub)\n\n## Key Features\n\n**Large Long-Term Memory and Context**\n\n- Thoughts system for persistent memory across projects\n- Structured handoff documents for context preservation\n- Research artifacts saved and referenceable\n- Plan documents that persist implementation context\n\n**Token Efficiency**\n\n- Parallel agents compress research before synthesis\n- CLI-based tools minimize token overhead\n- Focused agents for specific tasks\n- Context-aware handoff prompts\n\n**Secure Configuration**\n\n- Template system prevents committing secrets\n- `.gitignore` protection for sensitive files\n- No hardcoded credentials\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Core Tools**:\n\n- Claude Code\n- Git\n- jq\n\n**CLI Integrations** (optional but recommended):\n\n- `linearis` - Linear integration ([install](https://github.com/ryanrozich/linearis))\n- `gh` - GitHub CLI\n- `railway` - Railway deployments\n- `sentry-cli` - Error monitoring\n- `humanlayer` - Thoughts system ([install](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer))\n\n**MCP Tools** (bundled with plugins):\n\n- Context7 & DeepWiki - Built into `catalyst-dev` (~3.5k tokens)\n- PostHog - Built into `catalyst-analytics` (~40k tokens when enabled)\n- Sentry - Built into `catalyst-debugging` (~20k tokens when enabled)\n\nRun the prerequisite check:\n\n```bash\n/check_prerequisites\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nBuilt on patterns from:\n\n- [HumanLayer](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer) - Thoughts system for shared persistent\n  memory and research/plan/implement/validate workflow\n\nPersonal refinement over hundreds of hours on real projects.\n\n## Contributing\n\n**This is my personal workflow workspace**, primarily built for my own development style and\npreferences. That said, I'm happy to:\n\n- **Discuss ideas** - Open issues with workflow suggestions or improvements\n- **See your forks** - Adapt it to your needs and share what you built\n- **Fix bugs** - If something's broken, let me know\n- **Learn together** - Share your workflow patterns and approaches\n\n**Important**: I may not accept PRs that change core workflows or add features I don't personally\nuse, since this is the workspace I rely on daily. But I **love** seeing how others adapt these\npatterns to their own needs!\n\n**Best approach**: Fork it, make it yours, and share what you learned.
