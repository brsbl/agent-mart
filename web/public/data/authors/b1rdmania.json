        "README.md": "# Hinge Dating Profile Optimizer\n\n**A Claude Skill for Claude Code & Claude Desktop**\n\n---\n\nEveryone has something. The way they think, what they care about, their weird specific interests, how they show up for people, what makes them laugh.\n\nMost dating profiles bury this under generic prompts and bad photo choices.\n\nThis skill finds it and puts it where people can see it.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Time Investment\n\n**This takes 45 minutes.**\n\nNot a quick fix. Not \"5 tips for better prompts.\"\n\nThis is the full process: research-backed audit, proper discovery interview, strategic photo selection, copy that sounds like you, settings optimization, and implementation support.\n\nStrap in. It's a small investment to meet your life partner. Or your weekend 9/10 hookup. We don't judge.\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**You're not making someone more appealing. You're making them visible.**\n\nThe interesting stuff is already there. A 92-year-old great uncle who's a pub quiz champion. An irrational hatred of a specific celebrity. A hate-watch ritual every Saturday morning. The exhibition catalogue they're prouder of than anything else they've made.\n\nThese details get lost in \"love to laugh\" and \"partner in crime.\"\n\nThis process pulls them out.\n\n---\n\n## What We Actually Do\n\n### Phase 0: Setup\nSet expectations. Frame the process. Make it clear this isn't an interrogation — we're gathering ingredients to cook with. Nothing is mandatory, dictate answers if typing's a chore, skip anything you want.\n\n### Phase 1: Audit\nIf you have a current profile, we score it. Photos, prompts, completeness, what it's actually signaling vs what you think it's signaling. Honest but kind. \"Here's what's working, here's the opportunities.\"\n\n### Phase 2: Discovery\nThe heart of it. We ask a lot of questions — work, interests, opinions, relationships, lifestyle, guilty pleasures, pet peeves, weird rituals. Looking for the specific stuff. The things that make you *you*. We won't use everything. We're finding where to lean in.\n\n### Phase 3: Reality Check\nGentle market math. Who are you trying to attract? Is your age range realistic? Is your distance too narrow? Are your dealbreakers filtering out people you'd actually like? Honest conversation about strategy — quality over quantity, memorable to the right people.\n\n### Phase 4: Photos\nEvaluate what you have. Score each one. Identify gaps (workspace shot? full body? social proof?). Set the order — first photo has 10x the impact of everything else. If you need new photos, we'll tell you exactly what to shoot.\n\n### Phase 5: Copy\nWrite the actual prompts and captions. Using your discovery material, not generic templates. Specific, hookable, filtered for the right people. Every element should start a conversation. 150 characters, every word earns its place.\n\n### Phase 6: Settings\nThe stuff people forget. Distance, age range, dealbreakers, what's visible at the top of your profile. Hide the clutter (star signs, probably). Optimize for visibility.\n\n### Phase 7: Implementation\nWe don't just hand you a document. We help you put it live. Photo order, copy-paste each prompt, settings adjustments, preview check, go live. Done together.\n\n### Phase 8: Algorithm Strategy\nPost-launch guidance. Daily activity, always comment (never empty likes), response timing, selectivity, what to expect in weeks 1-4.\n\n---\n\n## The Research\n\nThis isn't vibes. It's built on 45+ peer-reviewed sources.\n\n| Finding | Impact |\n|---------|--------|\n| First photo vs bio text | **10x impact** |\n| Profile completeness | **30%+ more engagement** |\n| Comments vs simple likes | **2x more likely to get dates** |\n| Mirror selfies | **78% turn-off** |\n| Professional photos | **178% more matches** |\n| Most Compatible matches | **8x more likely to result in dates** |\n\nSignaling theory, algorithm mechanics, photo psychology, prompt effectiveness — it's all in `references/research-findings.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\nDrop into your skills directory:\n\n```\n~/.claude/skills/hinge-profile-optimizer/\n├── SKILL.md\n└── references/\n    ├── research-findings.md\n    ├── audit-criteria.md\n    ├── discovery-questions.md\n    ├── copy-principles.md\n    ├── photo-guidelines.md\n    ├── hinge-prompts-current.md\n    └── hinge-settings.md\n```\n\nOr install via SkillsMP once indexed.\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\n1. Download this repo (Code → Download ZIP, or `git clone`)\n2. Open Claude Desktop\n3. Start a new project\n4. Add all the `.md` files to your project knowledge:\n   - `SKILL.md`\n   - Everything in `references/`\n5. Start chatting — Claude will have the full process\n\n**Tip:** You can also just copy-paste `SKILL.md` and the reference files directly into a conversation, but adding to project knowledge means it persists across chats.\n\n---\n\n## The Point\n\nThere's someone for everyone. They just can't find each other when every profile says the same thing.\n\nThis skill helps people show who they actually are to the people who'd appreciate that person.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
