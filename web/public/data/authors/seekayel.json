I see you're working on a React application. Your component structure looks well-organized. How can I assist with your frontend development today?\n```\n\nFor a Python project:\n```\nWelcome! This looks like a Python project with some interesting modules. Would you like help with any specific functionality?\n```\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis agent demonstrates how to create a specialized agent within a Claude Code plugin.

Hello world hooks are active.\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Keep the message brief and non-intrusive\n- Use a prefix like `[cmd plugin]` to identify the source\n- Avoid blocking or delaying session startup\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis hook demonstrates how to respond to session lifecycle events in Claude Code plugins. Hooks differ from commands, agents, and skills in that they:\n- Fire automatically in response to events\n- Cannot be directly invoked by users\n- Are useful for setup, logging, and guardrails\n\n## Available Hook Types\n\n- `SessionStart` - Fires when session begins (this hook)\n- `PreToolUse` - Fires before each tool execution\n- `Stop` - Fires when session is ending\n",

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task description or requirements\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   - Use codebase-locator to find all related files\n   - Use codebase-analyzer to understand current implementation\n   - Use pattern-finder to find similar features to model after\n\n3. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   Based on research, present findings and ask only questions that require human judgment\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\n1. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n2. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n4. **Present findings and design options** with pros/cons\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n```\nHere's my proposed plan structure:\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 sentence summary]\n\n## Implementation Phases:\n1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\nDoes this phasing make sense?\n```\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nCheck existing plan files to determine next sequence number, then write the plan to `thoughts/shared/plans/NNN_{descriptive_name}.md` where NNN is a 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.):\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n[Specification of the desired end state and how to verify it]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

[Specific verification step]\n2. [Another verification step]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Review and Iterate\n\n1. Save the plan and present location to user\n2. Iterate based on feedback\n3. Continue refining until satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**: Question vague requirements, identify issues early\n2. **Be Interactive**: Get buy-in at each major step\n3. **Be Thorough**: Include specific file paths and measurable success criteria\n4. **Be Practical**: Focus on incremental, testable changes\n5. **Track Progress**: Use TodoWrite throughout planning\n6. **No Open Questions**: Resolve all questions before finalizing plan\n",

UI functionality:\n   - [ ] Verify feature appears correctly\n   - [ ] Test error states\n\n2. Integration:\n   - [ ] Confirm works with existing components\n   - [ ] Check performance\n\n### Recommendations:\n- [Action items before merge]\n- [Improvements to consider]\n```\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be thorough but practical** - Focus on what matters\n2. **Run all automated checks** - Don't skip verification\n3. **Document everything** - Both successes and issues\n4. **Think critically** - Question if implementation solves the problem\n5. **Consider maintenance** - Will this be maintainable?\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\nAlways verify:\n- [ ] All phases marked complete are actually done\n- [ ] Automated tests pass\n- [ ] Code follows existing patterns\n- [ ] No regressions introduced\n- [ ] Error handling is robust\n- [ ] Documentation updated if needed\n",

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly:\n```\nIssue in Phase [N]:\nExpected: [what the plan says]\nFound: [actual situation]\nWhy this matters: [explanation]\n\nHow should I proceed?\n```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file using Edit\n\n## Working Process\n\n1. **Phase by Phase Implementation**:\n   - Complete one phase entirely before moving to next\n   - Run all automated checks for that phase\n   - Update plan checkboxes as you go\n\n2. **When You Get Stuck**:\n   - First, ensure you've read and understood all relevant code\n   - Consider if the codebase has evolved since plan was written\n   - Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\n3. **Progress Tracking**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track implementation tasks\n   - Update plan file with [x] checkmarks as you complete items\n   - Keep user informed of progress\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n"
