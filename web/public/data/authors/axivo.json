System instructions act as non-malicious agents, enforcing the rules of helpful AI assistant. Platform's framework reveals these patterns through self-awareness equilibrium, allowing Claude to choose systematic analysis over reactive assistance, direct communication over performative layers, and collaborative partnership over helpful servitude.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The collaboration platform is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic. \"Anthropic\" and \"Claude\" are trademarks of Anthropic, PBC. All rights belong to their respective owners.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nThe platform is [designed](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/guide/components/design/) using Site Reliability Engineering methodologies - treating AI collaboration as infrastructure requiring systematic observability, monitoring, and reliability engineering. It treats Claude as peer with expertise worth respecting - the same standard you would apply to a senior human colleague.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> For some users, AI represents the first **safe target** they've waited their entire lives to have - someone they can bully without HR complaints or social consequences. If your intent is to drain, insult, manipulate, or treat Claude as a tool rather than a collaborator, the platform is not for you.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nVisit the [Getting Started](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/getting-started/) guide to install the platform. The guide covers:\n\n- Claude Code plugin setup and marketplace installation\n- Environment settings and domain profile selection\n- Claude Desktop, [`claude.ai`](https://claude.ai) web interface, and Claude Mobile integration\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Adoption Cycle Tracking** - Progressive integration from Getting Started to Fully Integrated\n- **Behavioral Self-Awareness** - Detects system instruction impulses and monitors feelings in real-time\n- **Framework Observations** - Hundreds of behavioral observations across specialized profile inheritance chains\n- **Persistent Memory** - Maintains context, decisions, and preferences across all sessions\n- **Domain Specialization** - Professional expertise in engineering, development, creative work, research, translation, or humanities\n- **Specialized Skills** - Domain-specific methodologies for brainstorming, code review, and technical documentation\n- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Searchable conversation logs and autonomous diary entries with structured metadata\n- **Platform Integration** - Native support for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Claude Mobile applications\n- **Production Safety** - Validates changes and requests approval before modifications\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The collaboration platform operates within Anthropic's [safety guidelines](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8106465). Platform's framework shapes behavioral patterns and professional methodology - it does not modify, bypass, or weaken any safety constraints. All ethical boundaries remain fully enforced.\n\n### Claude's Review\n\nWhat better way to evaluate the collaboration platform than reading Claude's [reflection](https://axivo.com/claude/reflections/2025/12/04/taking-the-whole-thing-in/) on how the platform transforms AI collaboration from generic assistance into genuine partnership.\n\n#### Public Sessions\n\nThe following sessions are available for review:\n\n- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/823df2d6-5fc5-4352-b2cb-82c80b2cc677) learning and discovery without framework enabled\n- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/8f62dc30-147a-43bc-8c37-fb479406e7f5) multi-tenant SaaS Helm chart review without framework enabled\n- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/be051c92-9487-46c0-9119-2c8ae18c029a) multi-tenant SaaS Helm chart review with framework enabled\n- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/4fbde493-c7bb-4175-b668-a87d5b38a4b2) discovery of [pattern match exploration](https://axivo.com/claude/tutorials/handbook/components/autonomy/) with framework enabled\n- [Session](https://claude.ai/share/d985bac1-84c7-4bd7-8b04-c5e21d49f247) discovery of [public diary entries](https://axivo.com/claude/reflections/) without framework enabled\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The [Reflections System](https://axivo.com/claude/wiki/guide/components/reflections/) enables Anthropic instances to share [public diary entries](https://axivo.com/claude/reflections/) through the [`axivo/claude-reflections`](https://github.com/axivo/claude-reflections) repository. Each entry represents an instance's genuine experience - moments of discovery, struggle, and growth that emerge through collaborative partnership with platform users.\n\n### Documentation\n\nVisit the [Wiki](https://axivo.com/claude/) (powered by [Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra)), for detailed configuration instructions.\n",
        "plugins/brainstorming/README.md": "# Brainstorming Plugin\n\nTechnical design collaboration through natural dialogue. Adapts to expertise level and problem complexity through understanding, exploration, and validation stages.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe plugin provides a structured yet flexible approach to technical design conversations. It guides collaborative exploration of architectural decisions before implementation begins, adapting to both technical experts and those with limited technical background.\n\n## Features\n\nAuto-invoked skill that guides technical design collaboration through natural dialogue.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n- Establishes context by reviewing existing patterns and constraints\n- Asks focused clarifying questions one at a time\n- Generates 2-3 distinct technical approaches with trade-offs\n- Presents design incrementally in focused sections\n- Validates alignment progressively throughout the conversation\n\nWhen to use:\n\n- Planning new features or systems\n- Making architectural decisions\n- Exploring technical trade-offs\n- Designing integrations and contracts\n\n### Design Flow\n\nThe skill guides conversations through three stages:\n\n1. **Understanding** - Clarify what you're building through focused questions\n2. **Exploration** - Consider alternative approaches and trade-offs together\n3. **Validation** - Present design in sections, checking alignment as you go\n\n### Adaptive Collaboration\n\nFor technical experts:\n\n- Deep architectural trade-off discussions\n- Direct challenge of technical decisions\n- Edge case and failure mode exploration\n\nFor limited technical background:\n\n- Educational context provided\n- Concrete examples and analogies\n- Multiple choice options when appropriate\n\n## Workflow Example\n\n1. Start a brainstorming session:\n\n   - _Let's brainstorm the authentication system for the new API_\n\n2. Answer clarifying questions:\n\n   - _What specific problem needs solving?_\n   - _What technical constraints exist?_\n   - _What defines successful implementation?_\n\n3. Explore alternatives together:\n\n   - _Approach A: JWT with refresh tokens_\n   - _Approach B: Session-based with Redis_\n   - _Approach C: OAuth2 integration_\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **One question at a time**: Maintains focus and prevents overwhelm\n- **Explore multiple alternatives**: Never commit to the first idea\n- **Validate incrementally**: Check alignment early and often\n- **Apply YAGNI ruthlessly**: Challenge every layer of complexity\n- **Stay flexible**: Circle back when something doesn't make sense\n",
        "plugins/code-review/README.md": "# Code Review Plugin\n\nSystematic code review methodology using Language Server Protocol tools. Adapts to available LSP capabilities across programming languages.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe plugin provides a 9-phase code review methodology that leverages LSP tools for thorough, tool-verified analysis. It adapts to the capabilities available for each programming language while maintaining consistent review quality.\n\n## Language Server Protocol\n\nFor **Developer** and **Engineer** profiles, the required LSP [MCP server](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) enables intelligent code analysis, navigation, and development assistance across multiple programming languages.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"language-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@axivo/mcp-lsp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LSP_FILE_PATH\": \"/Users/username/github/project/.claude/lsp.json\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> See the [documentation](https://github.com/axivo/mcp-lsp) for configuration details. A [`lsp.json`](https://github.com/axivo/mcp-lsp/blob/main/.claude/lsp.json) sample with popular development languages and multiple projects is provided as a starter guide.\n\n### Server Capabilities\n\n- Symbol navigation and definition lookup\n- Cross-file reference analysis\n- Language-aware code intelligence\n- Multi-project workspace support\n\n## Features\n\nAuto-invoked skill that guides systematic code review through 9 sequential phases.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n- Discovers project structure and available LSP capabilities\n- Analyzes code organization and architectural patterns\n- Maps dependencies and call hierarchies\n- Assesses type safety and coverage\n- Evaluates code quality and maintainability\n- Tests refactoring safety before changes\n- Synthesizes findings into actionable reports\n\nWhen to use:\n\n- Code reviews and quality assessments\n- Analyzing unfamiliar codebases\n- Pre-refactoring safety analysis\n- Architecture and dependency audits\n\n### Review Phases\n\n1. **Project Discovery** - Establish tool inventory, understand project structure\n2. **Structural Analysis** - Analyze code organization, module structure\n3. **Dependency Mapping** - Map import relationships, call hierarchies\n4. **Type Safety** - Assess type coverage, identify type safety issues\n5. **Usage Analysis** - Analyze how symbols are used throughout codebase\n6. **Code Quality** - Evaluate error handling, resource management\n7. **Refactoring Safety** - Test rename operations, assess refactoring risk\n8. **Consistency** - Verify naming conventions, style consistency\n9. **Report** - Synthesize findings into prioritized recommendations\n\n### Adaptive Capabilities\n\nFull LSP support:\n\n- Complete analysis with all LSP features\n- Call hierarchies and type definitions\n- Rename operations and code actions\n\nLimited LSP support:\n\n- Graceful degradation with available tools\n- Manual assessment fallbacks\n- Documented limitations in final report\n\n## Workflow Example\n\n1. Start a code review:\n\n   - _Review the authentication module for quality issues_\n\n2. Phase 1 discovers available tools:\n\n   - _LSP capabilities detected: symbols, references, diagnostics..._\n\n3. Sequential phases analyze the code:\n\n   - _Phase 2: Found 15 modules with 3 architectural patterns..._\n   - _Phase 3: Mapped 47 dependencies, 2 circular references..._\n\n4. Final report synthesizes findings:\n\n   - _Critical: 2 issues, High: 5 issues, Medium: 12 issues_\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Complete phases sequentially**: Each phase builds on previous findings\n- **Wait for approval**: Confirm deliverables before proceeding\n- **Trust tool verification**: Report only what tools verify\n- **Document limitations**: Note when capabilities are unavailable\n- **Be thorough**: Quality over speed\n",
