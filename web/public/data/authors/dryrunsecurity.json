        "README.md": "# DryRunSecurity Skills for AI Coding Assistants\n\nOfficial skills for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex) to help fix security vulnerabilities identified by DryRunSecurity.\n\n## What This Does\n\nWhen DryRunSecurity scans your pull request and leaves a comment about a security vulnerability, this skill helps your AI coding assistant understand and fix the issue. Instead of just telling you there's a problem, you get guided remediation.\n\n**The Flow:**\n```\nDryRunSecurity finds vulnerability → Comments on your PR →\nYou ask your AI assistant to fix it → Skill guides contextual fix →\nYou push the fix → DryRunSecurity approves\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Context is King.** DryRunSecurity spends significant effort understanding your codebase to identify *real* vulnerabilities. This remediation skill does the same - it guides AI assistants to:\n\n1. **Understand your codebase** - Existing patterns, tech stack, utilities\n2. **Research authoritative sources** - Official docs, OWASP, CWE references\n3. **Apply contextual fixes** - Matches your code style, uses your existing utilities\n4. **Explain and verify** - Why it was vulnerable, why the fix works\n\nNo static cheat sheets. No generic examples. Fixes grounded in *your* code.\n\n## Installation\n\n### For Cursor\n\nDownload to your project (always latest):\n```bash\ncurl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/main/standalone/.cursorrules\n```\n\nOr pin to a specific version:\n```bash\ncurl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/v1.0.0/standalone/.cursorrules\n```\n\n### For Windsurf\n\nDownload to your project (always latest):\n```bash\ncurl -o .windsurfrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/main/standalone/.windsurfrules\n```\n\nOr pin to a specific version:\n```bash\ncurl -o .windsurfrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/v1.0.0/standalone/.windsurfrules\n```\n\n### For Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace\n\n# Install the remediation plugin\n/plugin install dryrun-remediation@dryrunsecurity\n```\n\n### For Other AI Assistants (VS Code, Codex, etc.)\n\nDownload or copy [`standalone/RULES.md`](standalone/RULES.md) into your AI assistant's system prompt or rules configuration.\n\n## Versioning\n\nAll skill files include a version number in their header:\n```\n# Version: 1.0.0\n```\n\n### Version Policy\n\n- **`main` branch** - Always contains the latest version\n- **Git tags** (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.) - Pinned releases\n\n### Staying Up to Date\n\n**Option 1: Always latest (recommended for most users)**\n```bash\n# Re-run the curl command to get the latest\ncurl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/main/standalone/.cursorrules\n```\n\n**Option 2: Pin to a version**\n```bash\n# Use a specific tag\ncurl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/v1.0.0/standalone/.cursorrules\n```\n\n### Checking Your Version\n\nLook at the top of your rules file:\n```\n# DryRunSecurity Vulnerability Remediation\n# Version: 1.0.0\n```\n\nCompare with the [latest release](https://github.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, share the DryRunSecurity finding with your AI assistant:\n\n```\n\"DryRunSecurity found a SQL injection vulnerability in my PR.\nHere's the comment: [paste comment]. Can you help me fix it?\"\n```\n\nOr point directly to the file:\n\n```\n\"Fix the SQL injection in src/handlers/user.go line 45\"\n```\n\nThe skill guides the assistant to:\n1. Read and understand your affected code\n2. Find how similar issues are handled elsewhere in your codebase\n3. Research the authoritative fix for your framework/version\n4. Apply a fix that matches your existing patterns\n5. Explain why it was vulnerable and why the fix works\n\n## Supported Vulnerability Types\n\nThe skill works for any vulnerability DryRunSecurity identifies, including:\n\n- SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF\n- IDOR, Mass Assignment, Auth Bypass\n- Hardcoded Secrets, Path Traversal\n- Command Injection, Prompt Injection\n- Race Conditions, Deserialization issues\n- Cryptographic weaknesses\n- And any other security finding\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nexternal-plugin-marketplace/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json           # Claude Code marketplace config\n├── plugins/\n│   └── dryrun-remediation/\n│       ├── .claude-plugin/\n│       │   └── plugin.json        # Claude Code plugin manifest\n│       └── skills/\n│           └── remediation/\n│               └── SKILL.md       # Full skill for Claude Code\n├── standalone/\n│   ├── .cursorrules               # For Cursor IDE\n│   ├── .windsurfrules             # For Windsurf IDE\n│   └── RULES.md                   # Generic (VS Code, Codex, etc.)\n├── CONTRIBUTING.md                # Development workflow\n├── CHANGELOG.md                   # Version history\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Support\n\n- **Documentation:** https://docs.dryrunsecurity.com\n- **Issues:** https://github.com/DryRunSecurity/external-plugin-marketplace/issues\n- **Contact:** support@dryrunsecurity.com\n"
