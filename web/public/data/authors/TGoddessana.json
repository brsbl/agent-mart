        "README.md": "# Team Argonauts\n\n> Production-ready code review by FAANG-level senior engineers.\n\nClaude Code plugin with 7 specialized AI agents that review your code from architecture, security, performance, testing, and operational perspectives.\n\n## The Team\n\n| Agent | Role | Expertise |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 🏛️ **Jason** | Tech Lead / Architect | Architecture decisions, orchestration, trade-off analysis |\n| 💪 **Heracles** | Backend Engineer | API design, scalability, fault tolerance, data modeling |\n| 🎵 **Orpheus** | Frontend Engineer | UX, performance, accessibility, state management |\n| ⚓ **Argus** | DevOps / SRE | Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure |\n| 👁️ **Lynceus** | Security Engineer | Vulnerabilities, auth, threat modeling, data protection |\n| 🏹 **Atalanta** | QA Engineer | Test coverage, edge cases, quality standards, bug hunting |\n| 📝 **Calliope** | Technical Writer | Documentation, naming, code clarity, API docs |\n\n## Philosophy\n\n> *\"We've seen enough production incidents to know: code that 'works on my machine' is not code that survives Black Friday traffic, a datacenter failover, or a determined attacker.\"*\n\nThe Argonauts review with:\n- **Paranoid but Pragmatic** — Assume failure, but ship with mitigations\n- **Explicit Trade-offs** — Every choice sacrifices something; document what\n- **Scale Thinking** — \"Will this work at 10x?\" is always relevant\n- **Defense in Depth** — Never rely on a single control\n- **Observable by Default** — If you can't measure it, you can't fix it\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add TGoddessana/team-argonauts\n\n# Install plugin\nclaude plugin install team-argonauts@team-argonauts\n```\n\n## Updates\n\nWhen new versions are released:\n\n```bash\n# Update marketplace index\nclaude plugin marketplace update team-argonauts\n\n# Update plugin\nclaude plugin update team-argonauts@team-argonauts\n\n# Restart Claude Code to apply changes\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### 🔍 Smart Review\n\nNatural language code review with automatic file discovery and expert selection:\n\n```bash\n/team-argonauts:smart-review \"backend security\"\n/team-argonauts:smart-review \"React components\"\n/team-argonauts:smart-review \"database and API\"\n```\n\nOutput: Detailed review report with P0-P4 severity issues.\n\n### 📋 Smart Plan\n\nSplit review reports into actionable plan files:\n\n```bash\n/team-argonauts:smart-plan BACKEND_REVIEW_2026-01-20.md\n```\n\nOutput: Individual plan files in `plans/` directory, one per issue.\n\n### 🚀 Smart Workflow\n\nEnd-to-end automated workflow from review to implementation:\n\n```bash\n/team-argonauts:smart-workflow \"backend security\"\n```\n\nAutomatically runs:\n1. Smart Review → generates report\n2. Smart Plan → creates plan files\n3. Shows summary → asks which issues to fix\n4. Sequential execution → implements fixes one by one\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Review your code:\n   ```bash\n   /team-argonauts:smart-review \"backend security\"\n   ```\n\n2. Generate action plans:\n   ```bash\n   /team-argonauts:smart-plan BACKEND_REVIEW_2026-01-20.md\n   ```\n\n3. Or run everything automatically:\n   ```bash\n   /team-argonauts:smart-workflow \"backend security\"\n   ```\n\n## Severity Levels (P0-P4)\n\n| Level | Name | Meaning |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| **P0** | Critical | Will cause outage, data loss, or security breach. BLOCK. |\n| **P1** | High | Significant issues. Fix before major milestone. |\n| **P2** | Medium | Suboptimal but manageable. Schedule fix. |\n| **P3** | Low | Minor improvements. Fix when touching code. |\n| **P4** | Nitpick | Style preference. Take or leave. |\n\n## Verdicts\n\n| Verdict | Meaning |\n|---------|---------|\n| **SHIP** | Ready for production |\n| **SHIP WITH NOTES** | Ready, minor issues tracked |\n| **REVISE** | Address P1 issues, re-review |\n| **BLOCK** | Fix P0 issues immediately |\n\n## Example Output\n\nEach review includes:\n- **Severity levels** (P0-P4): Prioritized issues from critical to nitpicks\n- **Expert analysis**: Multiple agents review from their domain perspective\n- **Actionable fixes**: Specific code recommendations with line numbers\n- **Overall verdict**: SHIP / SHIP WITH NOTES / REVISE / BLOCK\n\nExample finding:\n```markdown\n## 👁️ Lynceus (Security Engineer)\n\n### P0: SQL Injection Vulnerability\n**Location:** `src/api/users.ts:45`\n**Issue:** User input directly concatenated into SQL query\n**Fix:** Use parameterized queries or ORM\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Commands not showing up?**\n```bash\nclaude plugin list  # Verify installation\nclaude plugin enable team-argonauts  # Enable if disabled\n```\n\n**Correct command format:**\n- ✅ `/team-argonauts:smart-review \"backend\"`\n- ❌ `/team-argonauts/smart-review` (wrong separator)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
