Strong policy based on research of context compaction, latent space extraction, linguistic hyperparameters, LLM state machine emulation, embedding machines like WFGY is the basis for the concepts behind the system prompt, but its been optimized for human edinting\r\n\r\nlooping (stop hook) - a more refined alternative to wiggum looping: including the native behaviors that claude code does during planning with better tooling preferences, and having a revision loop at the end with conversation insight as experimental improvements on wiggum looping (no special commands required, its built in)\r\n\r\ngit enforcement (stop hook) - always pushes code after updates (make sure you have init and a git remote)\r\n\r\nast analysis (thorns) - automated one-shot ast at conversation start offsets the need for explorative ast with compact context and less turns, code-search provides explorative discovery semantically, and code execution and reading being its final stage\r\n\r\npolicy - no md and txt creation, some built in tools force redirected to better tools\r\n\r\n<img width=\"225\" height=\"325\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/866e6861-a2e2-490d-8bd0-ec558753dbed\" />\r\n\r\n**Note:** we use gxe as an npx-to-github proxy to start the tools faster and keep them up-to-date, if you ever need to fix an issue with partial installs or something, just delete ~/.gxe and try again\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxMczBOi4uGHRFOb4J-R28kELLfWnzSN7R\r\n\r\n<!-- Stop hook test: 2026-01-13 -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
