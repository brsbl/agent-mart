        "README.md": "# Interpretive Orchestration: Epistemic Partnership System\n\n> Not a tool for faster coding. A partner for deeper thinking.\n\n**🚀 Ready to start?** → [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) (complete setup from scratch)\n\n**📋 Already set up?** → [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) (quick reference)\n\n**📖 Want depth?** → Keep reading below\n\n**🧠 Frameworks?** → [Cognitio Emergens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105) (Lin) | Interpretive Orchestration (Lin & Corley)\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 The Transformation\n\n**What you might expect:**\n\"Software that automates qualitative coding so I can finish faster\"\n\n**What you'll actually get:**\n\"A thinking partner that deepens my reflexivity, challenges my assumptions, and helps me understand how I construct knowledge - making me a better researcher\"\n\n**The difference matters.**\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 What Is This Really?\n\nThis isn't another CAQDAS tool (NVivo, Atlas.ti, etc.) with AI bolted on.\nThis isn't ChatGPT for ad-hoc document analysis.\nThis isn't Google's AI Co-Scientist for qualitative research.\n\n**This is infrastructure for human-AI epistemic partnership in interpretive inquiry.**\n\n### What That Means\n\n**Traditional tools:**\n- You input data → AI processes → You review output\n- AI automates manual labor (the \"calculator mindset\")\n- Faster but not necessarily deeper\n- Philosophy implicit and unexamined\n\n**Epistemic partnership:**\n- You build foundation → You + AI collaborate → You synthesize theory\n- AI asks questions that deepen YOUR reflexivity\n- Scale AND interpretive depth\n- Philosophy explicit and reflexive\n\n**The goal:** Transform how you think about interpretation itself, not just speed up coding.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 The Atelier of Co-Apprenticeship\n\n**Both human and AI are apprentices to the craft tradition of interpretive inquiry.** Neither masters the other. Both learn from craft principles: rigor, reflexivity, theoretical sensitivity, interpretive depth.\n\n*Also known as human-AI-human \"sandwich\" from our original research.*\n\n| Stage | What Happens | AI Role |\n|-------|--------------|---------|\n| **1. Solo Practice** 🎨 | Manual coding of 10-15 docs, memo-writing, framework development | Watches but doesn't intervene (theoretical sensitivity can't be automated) |\n| **2. Collaboration** 🤝 | Parallel streams (theoretical + empirical), synthesis, pattern characterization | 4-stage visible reasoning with @dialogical-coder |\n| **3. Tradition Dialogue** 💭 | Examine work through craft tradition's wisdom | @scholarly-companion asks tradition's questions |\n\n**The atelier ENFORCES Stage 1** - doors to collaborative workspace stay locked until solo practice complete.\n\n---\n\n## 🌊 Partnership Agency (Our Argument)\n\nThis plugin instantiates **Partnership Agency** from [Cognitio Emergens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105) (Lin, 2025): \"Human and AI boundaries dissolve into unified epistemic system generating insights neither could produce independently.\"\n\n**Four enabling conditions:**\n1. **Theoretical Foundation** - Stage 1 prevents calculator mindset\n2. **Visible Reasoning** - 4-stage process prevents black-box opacity\n3. **Recursive Evolution** - Both human and AI learn and adapt\n4. **Epistemic Ambidexterity** - Balance AI capability with human control\n\n**Our structure isn't constraint - it's architecture for Partnership Agency.** We provide ONE rigorous path, grounded in Cognitio Emergens and Gioia/Constructivist tradition.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Core Principles\n\n| Principle | What It Means |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **Epistemic Coherence** | Plugin adapts to YOUR declared philosophy (ontology, epistemology, GT tradition) |\n| **Reflexivity as Strength** | Prompts examine assumptions - awareness, not doubt |\n| **Human Authority** | AI organizes and suggests; YOU interpret and decide (non-negotiable) |\n| **Visible Reasoning** | 4-stage dialogical process shows HOW AI interpreted, not just WHAT |\n| **Meta-Cognition** | Every interaction teaches you to think about thinking |\n| **Progressive Depth** | Philosophy deepens through practice, not front-loaded lectures |\n\n---\n\n## 💡 What Makes This Different\n\n| Approach | Their Model | Our Model |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| **vs CAQDAS** | AI bolted onto manual tools | AI embedded with human authority maintained |\n| **vs ChatGPT** | Ad-hoc prompts, no audit trail | Systematic 4-stage dialogical process |\n| **vs AI Co-Scientist** | Full automation (STEM) | Human-centered augmentation (Social Science) |\n\n**Unique:** First infrastructure treating epistemology as UX design - embeds meta-cognition, enforces sandwich methodology, bundles MCP ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## 🌊 Why This Tool Feels Different\n\nThis plugin prioritizes **friction over flow**. If it stops you, it's asking you to think.\n\n| Trade-off | Meaning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Transformation over reliability** | Change how you think, not just process faster |\n| **Dialogue over determinism** | Socratic onboarding adapts to YOU |\n| **Reflection over efficiency** | Interpretive pauses are methodology, not bugs |\n\nIf something feels \"heavy\" - that's intentional epistemic friction preventing the \"calculator mindset.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n**New to Claude Code?** See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for complete hand-holding setup instructions (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n\n**Want a pre-configured environment?** Use the [Starter Project](https://github.com/linxule/interpretive-orchestration-starter) - a ready-to-use VS Code workspace with beginner-friendly settings.\n\n**Already have Claude Code?**\n```bash\ncd your-project-folder\nclaude\n/plugin install linxule/interpretive-orchestration\n/qual-check-setup  # Verify installation\n/qual-init         # Begin Socratic onboarding\n```\n\n**Then:** Complete Stage 1 manual coding (10-15 documents) before AI-assisted analysis. This builds the irreplaceable theoretical sensitivity that makes partnership meaningful.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 The MCP Ecosystem\n\nThis plugin bundles powerful MCPs as epistemic tools - **no API keys required for core functionality!**\n\n### Bundled (Auto-Install, No Keys Required)\n- **Sequential Thinking** - Dynamic reasoning through structured thought sequences (`/qual-think-through`)\n- **Lotus Wisdom** - Navigate paradoxes with five wisdom domains (`/qual-wisdom-check`)\n- **Markdownify** - Convert PDFs, transcribe audio, extract from videos/web (`/qual-import-pdf`)\n\n### Optional (Require API Keys)\n- **MinerU** - High-accuracy PDF parsing (90%+) for complex tables/figures - requires MINERU_API_KEY\n- **Zen MCP** - Multi-model validation (`/qual-get-perspectives`) - requires GOOGLE_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY\n- **Jina** - Fetch articles (`/qual-fetch-article`) - requires JINA_API_KEY\n- **Exa** - Search literature (`/qual-search-literature`) - requires EXA_API_KEY\n- **Zotero** - Manage bibliography - requires ZOTERO_API_KEY\n\n**These aren't utilities - they're tools for epistemic work.**\n\n**Markdownify is especially powerful for qualitative researchers:**\n- Transcribe interview audio files directly (no separate transcription service needed!)\n- Convert PDF articles and reports\n- Extract content from YouTube videos\n- Convert web pages and Office documents\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Skills (v0.2.0)\n\nSkills are auto-discoverable capability packages that Claude loads when relevant to your request.\n\n| Skill | Triggers | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| `project-setup` | \"initialize\", \"new project\" | Socratic onboarding + config |\n| `gioia-methodology` | \"data structure\", \"Gioia\" | Data structure building |\n| `literature-sweep` | \"literature\", \"Stream A\" | Search + fetch + organize papers |\n| `interview-ingest` | \"transcribe\", \"convert audio\" | Audio/PDF conversion |\n| `deep-reasoning` | \"think through\", \"plan\" | Sequential Thinking integration |\n| `paradox-navigation` | \"tension\", \"both/and\" | Lotus Wisdom integration |\n\n**Full list:** See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for all 11 skills and their triggers.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Agents\n\n| Agent | Stage | Role |\n|-------|-------|------|\n| `@stage1-listener` | 1 | Thinking partner - asks questions, never suggests codes |\n| `@dialogical-coder` | 2 | 4-stage visible reasoning for reflexive coding |\n| `@research-configurator` | 2 | \"The Whisperer\" - technical setup without jargon |\n| `@scholarly-companion` | 3 | Asks tradition's questions about theoretical significance |\n\n### @research-configurator: The Whisperer\n\nThis agent bridges research goals and technical implementation for non-coding researchers. **12 capabilities:**\n\n1. **Analysis Strategy Design** - Sampling, checkpoints, framework maturity\n2. **Model Selection** - Opus vs Sonnet vs Gemini based on YOUR needs\n3. **Thinking Budget Configuration** - How deeply AI reasons (cost/quality trade-off)\n4. **Batch Processing Strategy** - Sequential vs batch vs parallel\n5. **Cost Estimation** - Transparent per-item and total costs\n6. **API Setup** - Guided step-by-step (no coding required)\n7. **Quality Assessment** - Translates metrics to research signals\n8. **Human Review Orchestration** - When to pause, what to examine\n9. **Troubleshooting Translation** - Technical errors → methodological insights\n10. **Saturation Monitoring** - Tracks new concepts over time\n11. **Multi-Strategy Exploration** - Compare different analytical approaches\n12. **Framework Evolution** - Evidence-based refinement suggestions\n\n**Invoke:** `@research-configurator Help me set up my analysis`\n\n---\n\n## 🔒 Methodology Hooks\n\nThe plugin enforces the sandwich methodology through automated hooks:\n\n- **PreStage2** - Blocks AI coding until Stage 1 foundation complete\n- **PostFiveDocuments** - Triggers interpretive pause every 5 documents\n- **EpistemicCoherence** - Checks philosophical consistency\n\nIf you're blocked, it's asking you to think. That's intentional epistemic friction.\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 Pedagogical Approach\n\n| Phase | Focus | AI Role |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| **Foundation** (Week 1) | Socratic onboarding, Stage 1 manual coding | Watches, doesn't intervene |\n| **Deepening** (Week 4) | Stage 2 collaboration with @dialogical-coder | 4-stage visible reasoning |\n| **Partnership** (Week 12) | Stage 3 synthesis, meta-dialogue | Asks tradition's questions |\n\n**Philosophy deepens through practice**, not front-loaded lectures.\n\n---\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\n| Start Here | Go Deeper |\n|------------|-----------|\n| [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) - Complete setup | [DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md](DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md) - Why partnership |\n| [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) - 5-min guide | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Technical details |\n| [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Issues | [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Agent behavior |\n| [UPGRADE-GUIDE.md](UPGRADE-GUIDE.md) - v0.1→v0.2 | [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) - MCP ecosystem |\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 The Partnership Agreement\n\n| AI commits to | You commit to |\n|---------------|---------------|\n| Show reasoning, not just results | Complete Stage 1 foundation |\n| Express uncertainty genuinely | Maintain deep data engagement |\n| Honor your interpretive authority | Question both AI and your assumptions |\n\n**Mutual commitment creates epistemic partnership.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 Methodological Foundation\n\nThis plugin implements methodology from our learned practices through multiple research projects.\n\n**Key Innovations:**\n1. **Parallel discovery streams** (theoretical + empirical with mutual checking)\n2. **Dialogical prompting** (4-stage visible reasoning prevents shallow coding)\n3. **Interpretive pauses** (after every 5 documents, at transitions, for edge cases)\n4. **Pattern characterization** (systematic variation analysis, not essentialist discovery)\n5. **Multi-model triangulation** (prevents single-AI bias)\n6. **Sandwich architecture** (human foundation → collaboration → human synthesis)\n\n**Philosophical basis:**\n- Gioia & Corley systematic interpretivist approach (default)\n- Charmaz constructivist reflexivity\n- Configurable for other coherent traditions\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 For Whom?\n\n**Perfect for:** Qualitative researchers (GT, phenomenology, narrative analysis) who want scale AND interpretive depth\n\n**Not for:** Those seeking pure automation or unwilling to engage philosophical foundations\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 Quick Demo\n\n```bash\n/qual-init                    # Socratic dialogue establishes your philosophy\n/qual-status                  # Shows Stage 1 progress\n@dialogical-coder Code R01    # 4-stage reflexive coding after Stage 1 complete\n/qual-think-through           # Sequential Thinking for deep analysis\n/qual-wisdom-check            # Lotus Wisdom for paradox navigation\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ What Gets Built\n\nWhen you `/qual-init`, the plugin creates:\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .interpretive-orchestration/\n│   ├── epistemic-stance.md      # YOUR philosophy (human-readable)\n│   ├── config.json              # Settings (AI-readable)\n│   ├── conversation-log.jsonl   # AI-to-AI transparency\n│   └── reflexivity-journal.md   # YOUR growth tracking\n│\n├── stage1-foundation/           # 🍞 Human bread (top)\n├── stage2-collaboration/        # 🤝 Human-AI filling\n└── stage3-synthesis/            # 🍞 Human bread (bottom)\n```\n\n**The folder structure teaches the methodology.**\n\n**Note:** The plugin is ~90% markdown prompts, ~10% JavaScript hooks. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.\n\n---\n\n## 🤔 FAQ\n\n**Q: Why can't I skip Stage 1?**\nA: AI cannot develop YOUR theoretical sensitivity. Manual engagement creates the foundation that makes Stage 2 collaboration meaningful.\n\n**Q: What if I disagree with the AI?**\nA: Perfect! The AI organizes possibilities; YOU make interpretive judgments. Your authority is non-negotiable.\n\n**Q: Is this different from automation?**\nA: Fundamentally. Automation replaces human labor. Partnership augments human thinking through reflexive dialogue.\n\n---\n\n## 🌐 Community & Extensions\n\n**Built with:** Claude Code, MCP ecosystem (Sequential Thinking, Lotus Wisdom, Markdownify), Gioia & Corley methodology\n\n**Extend:** Fork for your GT tradition, build custom agents, contribute pattern modules.
