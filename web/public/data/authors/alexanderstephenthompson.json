Each owns a specific domain, loads its skill files automatically, and can be invoked directly on any project with `@agent-name`. The goal: confirm each piece works independently before composing them into a cohesive team.\n\n### Overview\n\n| Agent | Domain | Phases | Skills Loaded | Invocation |\n|-------|--------|--------|---------------|------------|\n| [css-improver](web/agents/css-improver.md) | CSS cleanup & tokenization | 10 | `web-css`, `code-quality` | `@css-improver` |\n| [html-improver](web/agents/html-improver.md) | Semantic HTML & accessibility | 10 | `design`, `web-accessibility`, `code-quality` | `@html-improver` |\n| [code-improver](core/agents/code-improver.md) | Code readability & clarity | 9 | `code-quality` | `@code-improver` |\n| [web-restructure](core/agents/web-restructure.md) | 3-tier architecture migration | 8 | `architecture`, `code-quality` | `@web-restructure` |\n\n---\n\n### CSS Improver\n\nTakes CSS from any state to a clean, tokenized architecture. The core problem it solves: AI-generated CSS drifts across sessions — similar components end up with slightly different padding, colors, and spacing. One edit becomes a partial fix because `#fff`, `white`, and `rgb(255,255,255)` are the same color in different formats. This agent unifies everything into shared token-based rules so one edit propagates everywhere.\n\nNo Tailwind, no PostCSS. Vanilla CSS with design tokens.\n\n| Phase | What It Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| 1. Baseline | Inventory CSS files, count hardcoded values, detect existing tokens |\n| 2. Structure | Migrate to 5-file architecture (`reset → global → layouts → components → overrides`) |\n| 3. Dead CSS | Remove unused selectors, duplicates, empty rules, commented-out blocks |\n| 4. Consistency | Hunt near-duplicates — group by visual role, normalize values, merge 80%+ identical rules |\n| 5. Tokenize | Replace repeated hardcoded values with CSS variables in `:root` |\n| 6. Property Order | Normalize to 5-group convention (positioning → box model → typography → visual → animation) |\n| 7. Component States | Ensure all interactive elements have default, hover, active, focus, disabled |\n| 8. Responsive | Convert `max-width` queries to mobile-first `min-width`, standardize breakpoints |\n| 9. Validate | Re-run baseline scans, compare before vs after — every metric should improve |\n| 10. Report | Before/after summary with per-merge detail for near-duplicate consolidation |\n\n**Reads:** `web-css/references/file-architecture.md`, `web-css/assets/token-reference.md`, `web-css/assets/css-patterns.md`\n\n---\n\n### HTML Improver\n\nMakes HTML semantic and accessible. Replaces div-soup with correct elements, fixes heading hierarchy, ensures interactive elements are proper buttons/links, adds form labels, and cleans up class bloat. If Tailwind utility chains are present, extracts them into semantic CSS classes rather than extending them.\n\n| Phase | What It Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| 1. Scan | Find all HTML/JSX/TSX files, count violations by category |\n| 2. Landmarks | Replace `<div>` wrappers with `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` |\n| 3. Headings | Fix heading hierarchy — one `<h1>` per page, no skipped levels |\n| 4. Interactive | Convert clickable divs/spans to `<button>`, navigation divs to `<a>`, add keyboard support |\n| 5. Forms | Add `<label>` to every input, group with `<fieldset>`, use correct input types |\n| 6. Images | Add meaningful `alt` text, mark decorative images with `alt=\"\"`, use `<figure>` where appropriate |\n| 7. Lists & Data | Replace div-lists with `<ul>`/`<ol>`, div-tables with `<table>`, use `<dl>` for key-value pairs |\n| 8. Content | Fix `<b>` → `<strong>`, `<i>` → `<em>`, add `<time>`, `<address>`, `<abbr>` where applicable |\n| 9. Class Discipline | Reduce to 1-3 classes per element, extract Tailwind chains into semantic CSS classes |\n| 10. Report | Before/after counts per violation category |\n\n**Reads:** `design/references/semantic-html.md`, `design/references/accessibility-guide.md`, `design/assets/component-states-checklist.md`, `design/assets/anti-patterns.md`\n\n---\n\n### Code Improver\n\nLanguage-agnostic code readability cleanup. Makes code that works into code that communicates. Detects the project's language(s) and adapts naming conventions (Python `snake_case` vs JS `camelCase` vs C# `PascalCase`). Doesn't change behavior — tests must still pass after every phase.\n\n| Phase | What It Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| 1. Scan | Detect language(s), count magic values, abbreviations, generic names, dead code, deep nesting |\n| 2. Naming | Fix abbreviations (`usr` → `user`), generic names, booleans without prefix, directional clarity |\n| 3. Magic Values | Extract hardcoded numbers and strings into named constants |\n| 4. Dead Code | Remove commented-out code, unused imports/variables, contextless TODOs |\n| 5. Comments | Remove \"what\" comments, fix stale comments, add \"why\" comments where needed |\n| 6. Function Clarity | Early returns over nesting, extract large functions, simplify complex expressions |\n| 7. Error Handling | Fix empty catches, generic exceptions, add boundary validation |\n| 8. Docstrings | Add documentation to public APIs (purpose, params, returns, errors, examples) |\n| 9. Report | Before/after metrics with change counts per category |\n\n**Reads:** `code-quality/references/naming-reference.md`, `code-quality/references/error-handling-reference.md`, `code-quality/assets/docstring-templates.md`\n\n---\n\n### Web Restructure\n\nReorganizes a web project into the 3-tier architecture (`01-presentation/` → `02-logic/` → `03-data/`). No auto-detection guesswork — you invoke it knowing it's a web project. Moves files bottom-up (data tier first, then logic, then presentation) so dependencies always point downward. Uses `git mv` for every move to preserve history.\n\n| Phase | What It Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| 1. Inventory | Find every source file, record current location and what it does |\n| 2. Tier Mapping | Classify each file into presentation, logic, or data using placement guide |\n| 3. Dependency Check | Map imports, flag circular dependencies that will break during moves |\n| 4. Create Structure | Create `01-presentation/`, `02-logic/`, `03-data/` directories |\n| 5. Move Files | `git mv` files bottom-up — data tier first, logic second, presentation last |\n| 6. Clean Up | Remove empty directories, update entry points and configs |\n| 7. Verify | Confirm project builds/runs, all imports resolve, no circular dependencies |\n| 8. Report | File movement summary, tier distribution, any unresolved issues |\n\n**Reads:** `architecture/references/web.md`\n\n---\n\n## Productivity\n\nThinking and communication tools — not tied to any project type.\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/improve-prompt` | Analyze and refine a rough prompt with annotated improvements |\n| `/explain` | Produce a clear explanation using the Subject or Situational framework |\n\nSkills: explaining\n\n---\n\n## World Building\n\nUnity game development and VRChat content creation.\n\nSkills: unity-csharp, vrc-udon, vrc-worlds, vrc-avatars\n\n---\n\n## Data\n\nData engineering and cloud infrastructure.\n\nSkills: data-python, data-sql, data-pipelines, data-aws, data-iac\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\n# Deploy skills, commands, and agents\n/sync deploy\n\n# Install team plugins (one-time)\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/AlexanderStephenThompson/claude-hub\nclaude plugin install clean-team implement-team diagnose-team\n```\n\nSkills are the single source of truth. Teams reference `~/.claude/skills/`, not embedded copies. Updating a skill and running `/sync deploy` propagates the change everywhere.\n",

At the checkpoint, you review the report and decide: continue to refactoring, stop here, or read the full report first.\n\n**Phase 2** builds a roadmap from those findings and executes it slice by slice with safety gates.\n\nThe command auto-detects existing audit reports and offers to resume Phase 2. Pass `audit` as the first argument for read-only analysis without code changes.\n\n---\n\n## Agents\n\n| Phase | # | Agent | Job | Output |\n|-------|---|-------|-----|--------|\n| **Analyze** | 1 | **Organizer** | File moves, renames, folder organization | git commit |\n| | 2 | **Formatter** | Universal cleaning + project-type-specific conventions | git commit |\n| | 3 | **Auditor** | Parallel sub-agents for deep analysis | AUDIT-REPORT.md |\n| | — | **Checkpoint** | User confirms: continue / stop / review full report | — |\n| **Refactor** | 4 | **Tester** | Coverage assessment, writes safety tests | Coverage report |\n| | 5 | **Planner** | Phased roadmap from audit findings | Roadmap |\n| | 6 | **Challenger** | Gate 1: reviews plan feasibility | Approve/Revise/Block |\n| | 7 | **Refactorer** | Executes approved slices | git commits |\n| | 8 | **Verifier** | Gate 2: validates behavior + clarity | Approve/Route back/Block |\n\nThe Auditor launches 4-12 parallel sub-agents (4 core + up to 8 web, depending on stack) using the shared roster at `assets/parallel-audit-roster.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n| Invocation | Mode | What Happens |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `/clean-team:clean` | Full pipeline | Analyze → checkpoint → refactor |\n| `/clean-team:clean src/` | Full pipeline | Same, scoped to src/ |\n| `/clean-team:clean audit` | Audit only | Read-only parallel analysis → AUDIT-REPORT.md |\n| `/clean-team:clean audit css` | Audit only | Read-only analysis with CSS focus |\n| `/clean-team:clean audit structure` | Audit only | Structure focus (expands to 5 sub-auditors) |\n\nIf an existing AUDIT-REPORT.md is detected, the command asks whether to resume refactoring or start fresh.\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n# Full project clean + audit + refactor\n/clean-team:clean\n\n# Clean only src/\n/clean-team:clean src/\n\n# Read-only audit — full scan\n/clean-team:clean audit\n\n# Read-only audit — CSS focus\n/clean-team:clean audit css\n\n# Read-only audit — structure focus\n/clean-team:clean audit structure\n\n# Read-only audit — accessibility focus\n/clean-team:clean audit a11y\n```\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\nAgents inherit shared skills from `~/.claude/skills/`:\n\n| Skill | Used By |\n|-------|---------|\n| code-quality | All agents |\n| architecture | Organizer, Auditor, Planner, Challenger, Refactorer, Verifier |\n| security | Planner, Challenger |\n| design | Refactorer |\n| documentation | Verifier |\n\n**Web project tier enforcement:** When a web project is detected, the Auditor launches a Layer Architecture Auditor sub-agent that checks tier structure, import direction, layer purity, and file placement.

Can stop, continue, or review.\n- **Gate 1 (Challenger)**: Reviews plan before execution. Max 2 revision cycles.\n- **Gate 2 (Verifier)**: Confirms behavior unchanged, measures improvement. Max 2 fix cycles.\n- **Early exits**: Workflow can stop early if codebase already follows best practices.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis Scripts\n\n```bash\npython scripts/analyze_complexity.py <path>     # High-complexity functions\npython scripts/analyze_dependencies.py <path>   # Circular dependencies\npython scripts/detect_dead_code.py <path>       # Unused code\nnode scripts/check.js                           # Design system compliance (36 rules)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version | Changes |\n|---------|---------|\n| v4.1.0 | Consolidated three commands into one. `/clean-team:clean` now handles full pipeline, audit-only (`audit` arg), and resume (auto-detected from existing AUDIT-REPORT.md). Removed `/clean-team:audit` and `/clean-team:refactor`. |\n| v4.0.0 | Unified pipeline: Phase 1 (Analyze) and Phase 2 (Refactor) run as one command with a checkpoint between them. |\n| v3.4.0 | Added css-import-order rule, tier-structure/tier-imports enforcement, Architecture Structure Gate in Organizer |\n| v3.3.0 | Parallelized Auditor with shared sub-agent roster, added check.js (31 rules) |\n| v3.2.0 | Absorbed improvement-auditor + web-auditor into audit command |\n| v3.1.0 | Formatter replaced Stylist + Polisher with universal + type-specific profiles |\n| v3.0.0 | Merged old clean-team into refactor-team as Phase 1.

You'll only be asked questions if there's a true blocker or a Stop-ship decision.\n\n### Gated Decisions\n\nTwo quality gates ensure safety:\n\n1. **Plan Review Gate** (after planning)\n   - Challenger reviews slice plan for feasibility\n   - Ship -> implementation proceeds\n   - Ship with fixes -> planner adjusts (max 2 cycles)\n   - Stop-ship -> work stops, user asked for missing info\n\n2. **Diff Review Gate** (after implementation)\n   - Challenger reviews code changes\n   - Ship -> continue to security/refactor or finalize\n   - Ship with fixes -> implementor fixes (max 2 cycles)\n   - Stop-ship -> work stops\n\n### Early Exit: Trivial Requests\n\nFor trivial changes (single-line fix, typo correction):\n- Skip full planning workflow\n- Implement directly with TDD discipline\n- Quick diff review by Challenger\n- Ship\n\n### Conditional Steps\n\n**Security Review** — Triggered when work touches:\n- Authentication, authorization, sessions, tokens\n- Payments or financial flows\n- PII or regulated data\n- Multi-tenant boundaries\n- Publicly exposed endpoints\n- File upload/download, template rendering\n- New dependencies, infrastructure changes\n\n**Refactor** — Triggered when:\n- Challenger flagged structural issues\n- Implementor noted maintainability concerns\n- Code structure would benefit from improvement\n\n## Components\n\n### Agents (5)\n\nAll in `agents/`:\n- `planner.md` — Slice plan creation\n- `challenger.md` — Plan and diff review\n- `implementor.md` — Strict TDD execution\n- `security.md` — Security review\n- `refactorer.md` — Structure improvement\n\n### Skills Inheritance by Agent\n\n| Agent | Inherits | Why |\n|-------|----------|-----|\n| Planner | code-quality, architecture, security | Plans with architectural and security awareness |\n| Challenger | code-quality, architecture, security | Reviews for security risks and architecture |\n| Implementor | code-quality | Follows TDD and language standards |\n| Security | security | Focused security review |\n| Refactorer | code-quality, design | Executes with clean design patterns |\n\n### Commands (1)\n\n- `/implement-team:implement <feature>` — Run full workflow\n\n## Workflow Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Planning (Planner)\n\n- Frame the problem (goal, non-goals, constraints)\n- Decompose into 1-3 vertical slices\n- Define testable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)\n- Specify API contracts with semantic naming\n- Identify dependency boundaries\n- Define Docs Delta (what docs ship with code)\n- List top 3 risks with mitigations\n\n### Phase 2: Plan Review (Challenger)\n\n- Review slice plan for feasibility\n- Check assumptions are explicit\n- Verify acceptance criteria are testable\n- Validate dependency isolation strategy\n- Decision: Ship / Ship with fixes / Stop-ship\n\n### Phase 3: Implementation (Implementor)\n\nStrict TDD execution:\n\n| Phase | Action |\n|-------|--------|\n| **RED** | Write failing test for acceptance criterion |\n| **GREEN** | Implement minimum code to pass |\n| **REFACTOR** | Improve without changing behavior |\n\nRequirements:\n- Tests fail before code is written\n- All acceptance criteria have passing tests\n- Edge cases covered\n- Docstrings on all public APIs\n- Docs-site updates per Docs Delta\n\n### Phase 4: Diff Review (Challenger)\n\n- Review code changes\n- Verify tests cover all criteria\n- Check documentation completeness\n- Decision: Ship / Ship with fixes / Stop-ship\n\n### Phase 5: Security Review (Conditional)\n\nIf high-stakes work:\n- Threat Model Lite (assets, entry points, trust boundaries)\n- Security requirements verification\n- Decision: Pass / Pass with fixes / Stop-ship\n\n### Phase 6: Refactor (Conditional)\n\nIf structural issues flagged:\n- Improve structure without behavior change\n- Maintain test coverage\n- Re-verify with Challenger\n\n### Phase 7: Finalize\n\nFinal summary:\n- What changed (files, modules, dependencies)\n- Tests added (unit, integration, edge cases)\n- Documentation updated\n- Follow-ups if any\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nimplement-team/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json              #

Autonomous with a gated validation step.\n\n## The Team\n\n```\nUser Problem --> Clarifier --> Investigator --> Hypothesizer --> Resolver --> Validator\n                                                                                |\n                                                                             (Gate)\n```\n\n| Agent | Role | Model | Color |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Clarifier** | Extracts precise problem definition (intent vs. reality) | Opus | Cyan |\n| **Investigator** | Traces execution to find exact point of divergence | Opus | Blue |\n| **Hypothesizer** | Generates and validates root cause theories | Opus | Purple |\n| **Resolver** | Implements minimal TDD fix targeting root cause | Opus | Green |\n| **Validator** | Verifies fix satisfies user intent (Gate) | Opus | Yellow |\n\n## When to Use\n\n- You've tried multiple fixes and it's still wrong\n- Something works but not how you envisioned\n- The root cause is unclear after previous attempts\n- Previous fixes addressed symptoms but the problem returned\n- \"Close but not quite\" situations\n\n## Two Problem Types\n\n| Type | Description | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| **Bug** | Something is objectively broken. Code should do X but does Y. | Search returns duplicates despite DISTINCT |\n| **Mismatch** | Code works as built, but that's not what the user wanted. | Pagination works but user expected infinite scroll |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Git** -- Recommended for change tracking and history analysis\n- **Test framework** -- Project should have a working test suite for TDD fix cycle\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Load for a single session (from parent directory)\nclaude --plugin-dir ./diagnose-team\n\n# Or with full path\nclaude --plugin-dir \"path/to/diagnose-team\"\n\n# Validate plugin structure\nclaude plugin validate ./diagnose-team\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Run the full 5-agent diagnostic workflow\n/diagnose-team:diagnose \"Search results keep returning duplicates no matter what I try\"\n\n# Or invoke individual agents\n@clarifier \"The auth redirect keeps breaking after every fix\"\n@investigator  # after clarifier produces Problem Statement\n@hypothesizer  # after investigator produces Investigation Report\n@resolver      # after hypothesizer produces Hypothesis Report\n@validator     # after resolver produces Fix Summary\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Autonomous Execution\n\nThe workflow runs autonomously with minimal user interruption. You'll only be asked a question if the Clarifier cannot produce a Problem Statement without it (max ONE question), or when the Validator seeks your confirmation on APPROVE.\n\n### The Validator Gate\n\nThe Validator is the quality gate with three possible decisions:\n\n1. **APPROVE** -- All success criteria met, root cause addressed, user confirms\n2. **REVISE** -- Close but incomplete, routes back to Resolver with specific feedback (max 2 rounds)\n3. **ESCALATE** -- Pipeline cannot resolve, needs manual intervention\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Intent Over Tests** -- Tests prove code behavior. This team proves user satisfaction.\n2. **Root Cause Over Symptoms** -- If the bug keeps coming back, previous fixes addressed symptoms.\n3. **Minimal Change** -- Smallest fix that addresses the root cause.\n4. **Test First** -- No fix without a failing test.\n5. **User Confirmation Required** -- Validator gets explicit user confirmation.\n\n## Workflow Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Clarify (Clarifier)\n\n- Extract expected behavior (user intent) and observed behavior (reality)\n- Identify the precise delta between them\n- Classify as Bug or Mismatch\n- Document reproduction steps and what has been tried\n- Define testable success criteria\n\n### Phase 2: Investigate (Investigator)\n\n- Map execution path from entry point to observed behavior\n- Trace step by step, comparing expected vs. observed\n- Find the exact point of divergence\n- Analyze why previous fix attempts were insufficient\n- Document evidence for the divergence\n\n### Phase 3: Hypothesize (Hypothesizer)\n\n- Generate 2-5 ranked hypotheses about the root cause\n- Distinguish proximate causes from root causes\n- Design and run validation tests for each hypothesis\n- Select the most probable root cause\n- Define fix direction for the Resolver\n\n### Phase 4: Resolve (Resolver)\n\n- Write a failing test that reproduces the root cause\n- Implement the minimal fix that makes it pass\n- Run full test suite to verify no regressions\n- Verify against every success criterion\n- Document scope discipline (what was NOT changed)\n\n### Phase 5: Validate (Validator -- Gate)\n\n- Run reproduction steps from Problem Statement\n- Verify every success criterion independently\n- Check fix targets root cause, not symptom\n- Make decision: APPROVE / REVISE / ESCALATE\n- On APPROVE: confirm with user\n\n## Components\n\n### Agents (5)\n\nAll in `agents/`:\n- `clarifier.md` -- Problem definition and intent extraction\n- `investigator.md` -- Systematic divergence tracing\n- `hypothesizer.md` -- Root cause analysis and validation\n- `resolver.md` -- Minimal TDD fix implementation\n- `validator.md` -- Intent verification gate\n\n### Skills Inheritance by Agent\n\n| Agent | Inherits | Why |\n|-------|----------|-----|\n| Clarifier | code-quality | Understands code structure for problem extraction |\n| Investigator | code-quality, architecture | Traces execution across architectural boundaries |\n| Hypothesizer | code-quality, architecture | Analyzes root causes across system design |\n| Resolver | code-quality | Implements TDD fixes following code standards |\n| Validator | code-quality | Verifies fix quality and intent alignment |\n\n### Commands (1)\n\n- `/diagnose-team:diagnose <problem>` -- Run full diagnostic workflow\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\ndiagnose-team/\n+-- .claude-plugin/\n|   +-- plugin.json              # Plugin manifest (v1.0.0)\n+-- agents/\n|   +-- clarifier.md             # Step 1: Problem definition\n|   +-- investigator.md          # Step 2: Divergence tracing\n|   +-- hypothesizer.md          # Step 3: Root cause analysis\n|   +-- resolver.md              # Step 4: Minimal TDD fix\n|   +-- validator.md             # Step 5: Intent verification gate\n+-- commands/\n|   +-- diagnose.md              # Full diagnostic workflow command\n+-- README.md\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Team Philosophy\n\n- **Intent over tests** -- User satisfaction is the measure of success, not test coverage\n- **Root cause over symptoms** -- Find why it keeps breaking, not just what's broken\n- **Minimal change** -- Smallest fix that addresses the root cause\n- **Test first** -- Every fix is proven by a test that failed before and passes after\n- **Autonomous pipeline** -- Minimal user interruption with a clear gate for confirmation\n- **Bounded loops** -- Max 2 revision rounds prevents infinite cycles\n- **Responsible escalation** -- ESCALATE is a valid outcome, not a failure\n\n### How This Differs from Implement-Team\n\nThe implement-team builds NEW features. The diagnose-team fixes EXISTING problems.\n\n| Aspect | Implement-Team | Diagnose-Team |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|\n| Entry point | Feature request | Problem description |\n| Focus | What to build | What's wrong |\n| Planning | Slice plans | Problem statements |\n| Review | Plan + diff review | Root cause validation |\n| Gate | Challenger (Ship/Fix/Stop) | Validator (Approve/Revise/Escalate) |\n| Scope | Feature scope | Minimal fix scope |\n| User role | Provides requirements | Confirms fix matches intent |\n\n## Author\n\nAlexander Thompson -- Information Designer & Systems Thinker\n"
