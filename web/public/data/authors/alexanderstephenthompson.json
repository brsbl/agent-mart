At the checkpoint, you review the report and decide: continue to refactoring, stop here, or read the full report first.\n\n**Phase 2** builds a roadmap from those findings and executes it slice by slice with safety gates.\n\nThe command auto-detects existing audit reports and offers to resume Phase 2.

Autonomous with a gated validation step.\n\n## The Team\n\n```\nUser Problem --> Clarifier --> Investigator --> Hypothesizer --> Resolver --> Validator\n                                                                                |\n                                                                             (Gate)\n```\n\n| Agent | Role | Model | Color |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Clarifier** | Extracts precise problem definition (intent vs. reality) | Opus | Cyan |\n| **Investigator** | Traces execution to find exact point of divergence | Opus | Blue |\n| **Hypothesizer** | Generates and validates root cause theories | Opus | Purple |\n| **Resolver** | Implements minimal TDD fix targeting root cause | Opus | Green |\n| **Validator** | Verifies fix satisfies user intent (Gate) | Opus | Yellow |\n\n## When to Use\n\n- You've tried multiple fixes and it's still wrong\n- Something works but not how you envisioned\n- The root cause is unclear after previous attempts\n- Previous fixes addressed symptoms but the problem returned\n- \"Close but not quite\" situations\n\n## Two Problem Types\n\n| Type | Description | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| **Bug** | Something is objectively broken. Code should do X but does Y. | Search returns duplicates despite DISTINCT |\n| **Mismatch** | Code works as built, but that's not what the user wanted. | Pagination works but user expected infinite scroll |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Git** -- Recommended for change tracking and history analysis\n- **Test framework** -- Project should have a working test suite for TDD fix cycle\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Load for a single session (from parent directory)\nclaude --plugin-dir ./diagnose-team\n\n# Or with full path\nclaude --plugin-dir \"path/to/diagnose-team\"\n\n# Validate plugin structure\nclaude plugin validate ./diagnose-team\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Run the full 5-agent diagnostic workflow\n/diagnose-team:diagnose \"Search results keep returning duplicates no matter what I try\"\n\n# Or invoke individual agents\n@clarifier \"The auth redirect keeps breaking after every fix\"\n@investigator  # after clarifier produces Problem Statement\n@hypothesizer  # after investigator produces Investigation Report\n@resolver      # after hypothesizer produces Hypothesis Report\n@validator     # after resolver produces Fix Summary\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Autonomous Execution\n\nThe workflow runs autonomously with minimal user interruption. You'll only be asked a question if the Clarifier cannot produce a Problem Statement without it (max ONE question), or when the Validator seeks your confirmation on APPROVE.\n\n### The Validator Gate\n\nThe Validator is the quality gate with three possible decisions:\n\n1. **APPROVE** -- All success criteria met, root cause addressed, user confirms\n2. **REVISE** -- Close but incomplete, routes back to Resolver with specific feedback (max 2 rounds)\n3. **ESCALATE** -- Pipeline cannot resolve, needs manual intervention\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Intent Over Tests** -- Tests prove code behavior. This team proves user satisfaction.\n2. **Root Cause Over Symptoms** -- If the bug keeps coming back, previous fixes addressed symptoms.\n3. **Minimal Change** -- Smallest fix that addresses the root cause.\n4. **Test First** -- No fix without a failing test.\n5. **User Confirmation Required** -- Validator gets explicit user confirmation.\n\n## Workflow Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Clarify (Clarifier)\n\n- Extract expected behavior (user intent) and observed behavior (reality)\n- Identify the precise delta between them\n- Classify as Bug or Mismatch\n- Document reproduction steps and what has been tried\n- Define testable success criteria\n\n### Phase 2: Investigate (Investigator)\n\n- Map execution path from entry point to observed behavior\n- Trace step by step, comparing expected vs. observed\n- Find the exact point of divergence\n- Analyze why previous fix attempts were insufficient\n- Document evidence for the divergence\n\n### Phase 3: Hypothesize (Hypothesizer)\n\n- Generate 2-5 ranked hypotheses about the root cause\n- Distinguish proximate causes from root causes\n- Design and run validation tests for each hypothesis\n- Select the most probable root cause\n- Define fix direction for the Resolver\n\n### Phase 4: Resolve (Resolver)\n\n- Write a failing test that reproduces the root cause\n- Implement the minimal fix that makes it pass\n- Run full test suite to verify no regressions\n- Verify against every success criterion\n- Document scope discipline (what was NOT changed)\n\n### Phase 5: Validate (Validator -- Gate)\n\n- Run reproduction steps from Problem Statement\n- Verify every success criterion independently\n- Check fix targets root cause, not symptom\n- Make decision: APPROVE / REVISE / ESCALATE\n- On APPROVE: confirm with user\n\n## Components\n\n### Agents (5)\n\nAll in `agents/`:\n- `clarifier.md` -- Problem definition and intent extraction\n- `investigator.md` -- Systematic divergence tracing\n- `hypothesizer.md` -- Root cause analysis and validation\n- `resolver.md` -- Minimal TDD fix implementation\n- `validator.md` -- Intent verification gate\n\n### Skills Inheritance by Agent\n\n| Agent | Inherits | Why |\n|-------|----------|-----|\n| Clarifier | code-quality | Understands code structure for problem extraction |\n| Investigator | code-quality, architecture | Traces execution across architectural boundaries |\n| Hypothesizer | code-quality, architecture | Analyzes root causes across system design |\n| Resolver | code-quality | Implements TDD fixes following code standards |\n| Validator | code-quality | Verifies fix quality and intent alignment |\n\n### Commands (1)\n\n- `/diagnose-team:diagnose <problem>` -- Run full diagnostic workflow\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\ndiagnose-team/\n+-- .claude-plugin/\n|   +-- plugin.json              # Plugin manifest (v1.0.0)\n+-- agents/\n|   +-- clarifier.md             # Step 1: Problem definition\n|   +-- investigator.md          # Step 2: Divergence tracing\n|   +-- hypothesizer.md          # Step 3: Root cause analysis\n|   +-- resolver.md              # Step 4: Minimal TDD fix\n|   +-- validator.md             # Step 5: Intent verification gate\n+-- commands/\n|   +-- diagnose.md              # Full diagnostic workflow command\n+-- README.md\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Team Philosophy\n\n- **Intent over tests** -- User satisfaction is the measure of success, not test coverage\n- **Root cause over symptoms** -- Find why it keeps breaking, not just what's broken\n- **Minimal change** -- Smallest fix that addresses the root cause\n- **Test first** -- Every fix is proven by a test that failed before and passes after\n- **Autonomous pipeline** -- Minimal user interruption with a clear gate for confirmation\n- **Bounded loops** -- Max 2 revision rounds prevents infinite cycles\n- **Responsible escalation** -- ESCALATE is a valid outcome, not a failure\n\n### How This Differs from Implement-Team\n\nThe implement-team builds NEW features. The diagnose-team fixes EXISTING problems.\n\n| Aspect | Implement-Team | Diagnose-Team |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|\n| Entry point | Feature request | Problem description |\n| Focus | What to build | What's wrong |\n| Planning | Slice plans | Problem statements |\n| Review | Plan + diff review | Root cause validation |\n| Gate | Challenger (Ship/Fix/Stop) | Validator (Approve/Revise/Escalate) |\n| Scope | Feature scope | Minimal fix scope |\n| User role | Provides requirements | Confirms fix matches intent |\n\n## Author\n\nAlexander Thompson -- Information Designer & Systems Thinker\n"
