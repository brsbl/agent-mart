        "README.md": "# Bytebase Team Skills\n\nA collection of Claude Code skills shared by the Bytebase team. These skills encode proven workflows, domain knowledge, and best practices to help Claude Code assist more effectively with Bytebase-specific tasks.\n\n## What are Skills?\n\nSkills are reusable prompts and workflows that extend Claude Code's capabilities. When a skill is installed, Claude Code can invoke it to follow established patterns for specific tasks like writing release notes, debugging issues, or following code review guidelines.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `write-release-notes` | Generate professional Bytebase release notes by analyzing git commits, checking Terraform impact, searching Linear for customer feedback, and following established conventions |\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install these skills in two ways: via the **marketplace** (recommended for discovery and updates) or as a **direct plugin**.\n\n### Option 1: Install via Marketplace (Recommended)\n\nThe marketplace allows you to browse and install plugins, and receive updates when new skills are added.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add bytebase/team-skills\n\n# Step 2: Install the plugin from the marketplace\n/plugin install bytebase-team-skills@bytebase-team-skill-market\n```\n\n**Managing the marketplace:**\n\n```bash\n# List all configured marketplaces\n/plugin marketplace list\n\n# Update/refresh the marketplace to get latest plugins\n/plugin marketplace update bytebase-team-skill-market\n\n# Remove the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace remove bytebase-team-skill-market\n```\n\n### Option 2: Install as Direct Plugin\n\nIf you prefer to install the plugin directly without using the marketplace:\n\n```bash\n# Install directly from GitHub\n/plugin install bytebase/team-skills\n```\n\nOr using the full Git URL:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install https://github.com/bytebase/team-skills.git\n```\n\n**To install a specific version:**\n\n```bash\n/plugin install https://github.com/bytebase/team-skills.git#v1.0.1\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, skills are automatically available to Claude Code. You can invoke a skill by name:\n\n```bash\n# Example: Generate release notes\n/write-release-notes\n```\n\nClaude Code will also proactively use relevant skills when it detects a matching task.\n\n## Verifying Installation\n\nCheck that the plugin is installed:\n\n```bash\n/plugin list\n```\n\n## Uninstalling\n\n```bash\n# Remove the plugin\n/plugin uninstall bytebase-team-skills\n\n# If using marketplace, you can also remove the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace remove bytebase-team-skill-market\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo add a new skill:\n\n1. Create a new directory under `skills/` with your skill name\n2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with the skill definition (frontmatter + content)\n3. Submit a pull request\n\nSee existing skills for examples of the expected format.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
