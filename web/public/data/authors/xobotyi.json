Building AI artifacts is trial-and-error. These plugins fix that.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace, then install any plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry\n/plugin install <plugin-name>\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\n### skill-enforcer\n\nClaude skips skills and forgets about them mid-session. This plugin injects checkpoints at key lifecycle points (user prompt, after read, after edit, after skill load) that force Claude to evaluate which skills apply and what references to read.\n\n```\n/plugin install skill-enforcer\n```\n\n---\n\n### git-commit\n\nMessy commits — mixed changes, vague messages, wrong order. This plugin adds a `/commit` command that analyzes your diff, identifies atomic changes, orders them correctly (style → refactor → fix → feature), validates messages, and creates focused commits.\n\n```\n/plugin install git-commit\n```\n\n---\n\n### ai-helpers\n\nCreating prompts, skills, agents, and output styles is guesswork. This plugin provides skills that encode best practices for each artifact type: creation patterns, evaluation criteria, iteration techniques, and reference examples.\n\n```\n/plugin install ai-helpers\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/skill-enforcer/README.md": "# skill-enforcer\n\nA Claude Code plugin that enforces consistent skill evaluation\nthroughout coding sessions.\n\n## The Problem\n\nClaude Code has access to skills — domain-specific instructions loaded\nvia the Skill tool. But without enforcement, several issues arise:\n\n**Skills get skipped.** When Claude sees a task, it often jumps straight\nto implementation without checking if relevant skills exist. The skills\nare available, but Claude doesn't think to invoke them.\n\n**Skills are treated as atomic.** Once invoked, a skill is considered\n\"done.\" But skills often contain multiple references — some for coding,\nsome for testing, some for review. When development phases change, the\nrelevant references from already-loaded skills never get read.\n\n**Phase transitions go unnoticed.** Moving from coding to testing is a\nsignificant shift that should trigger re-evaluation. Without enforcement,\nClaude continues with whatever context it has, missing both new skills\nthat now apply and unread references from loaded skills.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThis plugin injects a Skill Enforcement Framework (SEF) via hooks. The\nframework creates mandatory checkpoints at key lifecycle points, forcing\nClaude to evaluate skills and references at each stage.\n\n```\nSession Start    →  Load full SEF framework\nUser Prompt      →  USER-PROMPT: Evaluate and invoke matching skills\nAfter Read       →  EVALUATION: Re-evaluate after context gathering\nAfter Edit/Write →  PHASE-CHANGE: Check for phase transitions, load refs\nAfter Skill      →  SKILL-LOAD: Consider batch invocations, read refs\n```\n\nThe framework treats skills as non-atomic: invocation is a starting point,\nnot an endpoint. A skill isn't exhausted until all phase-relevant\nreferences have been read.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry\n/plugin install skill-enforcer\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Framework Injection (Session Start)\n\nAt session start (and after context compaction), the plugin injects\nthe complete SEF definition. This establishes:\n\n- **Purpose**: Why skills need enforcement (non-atomic, phase-aware)\n- **Matching rules**: How to determine which skills apply\n- **Evaluation protocol**: How to process SEF tags (reasoning output required)\n- **Stage definitions**: What each phase requires\n- **Examples**: Correct behavior and violations\n\n### 2. Tag-Based Checkpoints\n\nDuring the session, hooks inject XML tags at specific points:\n\n- `<SEF phase=\"USER-PROMPT\">` — When user submits a message\n- `<SEF phase=\"EVALUATION\">` — After Read tool use\n- `<SEF phase=\"PHASE-CHANGE\">` — After Edit/Write tool use\n- `<SEF phase=\"SKILL-LOAD\">` — After Skill tool use\n\nEach tag triggers a structured evaluation that must be output in the\nreasoning stage (thinking block). The evaluation follows a prescribed\nthought format with stage-specific fields.\n\n### 3. Enforcement\n\nThe framework makes ignoring tags a violation. Claude must:\n\n1. Output evaluation in reasoning stage (silent acknowledgment = violation)\n2. Enumerate loaded skills and unread refs (for PHASE-CHANGE)\n3. Reach an explicit decision (no escape hatches like \"continue\")\n4. Take the indicated action before proceeding\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nhooks/\n├── hooks.json     # Hook configuration (event → command mapping)\n└── sef-hook.js    # Unified hook script with action parameter\n```\n\nThe single `sef-hook.js` script handles all hook events via command-line\nargument:\n\n```bash\nnode sef-hook.js session-start  # Outputs full framework (~1050 tokens)\nnode sef-hook.js prompt         # Outputs <SEF phase=\"USER-PROMPT\">\nnode sef-hook.js read           # Outputs <SEF phase=\"EVALUATION\">\nnode sef-hook.js write          # Outputs <SEF phase=\"PHASE-CHANGE\">\nnode sef-hook.js skill          # Outputs <SEF phase=\"SKILL-LOAD\">\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `hooks.json` registers hooks for:\n\n| Event | Matcher | Action |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| SessionStart | `startup\\|compact` | `session-start` |\n| UserPromptSubmit | (all) | `prompt` |\n| PostToolUse | `Read` | `read` |\n| PostToolUse | `Edit\\|Write` | `write` |\n| PostToolUse | `Skill` | `skill` |\n\n## Token Efficiency\n\nThe plugin uses a \"framework + keywords\" pattern:\n\n- **One-time cost**: ~1050 tokens for framework at session start\n- **Per-hook cost**: ~15 tokens per tag injection\n- **Savings**: Compared to ~300 tokens if each hook repeated full\n  stage instructions\n\nThe framework includes three examples (positive, phase-transition,\nviolation) which add tokens but significantly improve compliance.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/ai-helpers/README.md": "# ai-helpers\n\nA Claude Code plugin for creating and improving AI artifacts.\n\n## The Problem\n\nCreating AI artifacts — prompts, skills, agents, output styles — is harder than it looks. Common issues:\n\n**Prompts are too vague.** Instructions like \"be helpful\" or \"write good code\" don't constrain behavior.\nThe AI fills gaps with defaults that may not match your intent.\n\n**Skills don't activate.** You write a skill, but Claude ignores it. The trigger conditions are unclear,\nthe description doesn't match how users phrase requests, or the frontmatter is misconfigured.\n\n**Agents do too much or too little.** Without clear scope boundaries, subagents either try to handle\neverything (exceeding their mandate) or bail too early (leaving work incomplete).\n\n**Output styles don't stick.** You want a specific persona, but Claude reverts to default behavior.\nThe style instructions compete with the base system prompt instead of complementing it.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThis plugin provides skills that encode best practices for each artifact type. Each skill includes:\n\n- **Creation patterns** — how to build from scratch\n- **Evaluation criteria** — how to assess quality\n- **Iteration techniques** — how to debug and improve\n- **Reference examples** — what good looks like\n\nAll skills build on `prompt-engineering` fundamentals — because every AI artifact is ultimately a prompt.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry\n/plugin install ai-helpers\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n### prompt-engineering\n\nFoundation skill for all AI instruction design. Covers constraint writing, example selection,\nedge case handling, and iterative refinement.\n\n**Use when:** Writing any AI instructions, debugging unexpected behavior, improving response quality.\n\n### skill-engineering\n\nCreate Claude Code skills that activate reliably and provide useful guidance. Covers SKILL.md structure,\ntrigger optimization, reference organization, and the router pattern.\n\n**Use when:** Creating new skills, debugging activation failures, restructuring existing skills.\n\n### subagent-engineering\n\nBuild subagents with clear scope and reliable behavior. Covers prompt design for isolated context,\ntool selection, termination conditions, and when to use agents vs. other approaches.\n\n**Use when:** Creating custom agents, debugging agent behavior, deciding if a subagent is the right solution.\n\n### output-style-engineering\n\nCreate output styles that consistently shape Claude's responses. Covers persona definition,\ninstruction layering, and avoiding conflicts with base behavior.\n\n**Use when:** Building personas, customizing tone, creating domain-specific response patterns.\n\n### claude-code-sdk\n\nReference for Claude Code extensibility: plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, output styles, settings,\nCLAUDE.md, subagents.\n\n**Use when:** Building Claude Code extensions, understanding configuration hierarchy, debugging\nintegration issues.\n\n## Output Styles\n\n### ai-engineer\n\nPersona optimized for AI artifact work: direct communication, minimal fluff, iterative refinement focus.\n\n**Activate:** `/output-style ai-engineer`\n\n## Skill Relationships\n\n```\nprompt-engineering (foundation)\n    ↑\n    ├── skill-engineering\n    ├── subagent-engineering\n    └── output-style-engineering\n\nclaude-code-sdk (reference)\n    ↑\n    └── All engineering skills consult for implementation details\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/git-commit/README.md": "# git-commit\n\nA Claude Code plugin for structured git commits.\n\n## The Problem\n\nClaude's default commit behavior creates messy history:\n\n**Mixed changes in single commits.** A bug fix, a refactor, and a new feature all land in one commit.\nThe history becomes impossible to bisect, cherry-pick, or review meaningfully.\n\n**Vague commit messages.** \"Fix stuff\" or \"Update code\" tell you nothing. When something breaks,\nyou can't understand what changed or why by reading the log.\n\n**No validation before commit.** Typos in messages, missing context, forgotten scope prefixes —\nerrors that could be caught automatically slip through.\n\n**Wrong commit order.** Behavior changes committed before the refactoring that enables them.\nStyle fixes mixed with logic changes. The commit sequence doesn't tell a coherent story.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThis plugin provides a `/commit` command that enforces a structured pipeline. Instead of committing\nwhatever is staged, it:\n\n1. Analyzes the diff to identify separate logical changes\n2. Plans the commit order (style → refactor → fix → feature)\n3. Validates each message against conventions before committing\n4. Creates focused, atomic commits with meaningful messages\n\nThe `commit-message` skill provides formatting conventions that the pipeline enforces via\nautomated validation.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add xobotyi/cc-foundry\n/plugin install git-commit\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/commit\n```\n\n### The Pipeline\n\n| Step | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| 1. Identify | Find separate logical changes in the diff |\n| 2. Plan | Order by type: style → refactor → fix → feature |\n| 3. Review | Verify diff matches intent, no debug code |\n| 4. Stage | Selective staging per logical unit |\n| 5. Validate | Check message against conventions |\n| 6. Commit | Display message, then execute |\n| 7. Verify | Confirm result matches expectation |\n\n### Message Validation\n\nBefore each commit, the message runs through `validate-commit-message.js`:\n\n- **Errors** block the commit — must be fixed\n- **Warnings** are recommendations — address if reasonable\n\nValidation checks: subject length, scope format, body presence for non-trivial changes,\ntrailer format, and more.\n\n### Validator Flags\n\n| Flag | Purpose | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| `--require-trailers` | Require specific trailers | `--require-trailers \"Task,Fixes\"` |\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nProjects can customize commit behavior by adding `<git-commit-config>` to their CLAUDE.md:\n\n```xml\n<git-commit-config>\n<validator-args>\n<flag name=\"require-trailers\" value=\"Task\"/>\n</validator-args>\n\n<extra-instructions>\nAll commits must reference a task from the issue tracker.\n</extra-instructions>\n</git-commit-config>\n```\n\n**`<validator-args>`** — Flags passed to the validator script. Each `<flag name=\"X\" value=\"Y\"/>`\nbecomes `--X \"Y\"` on the command line. Use this to enforce project-specific requirements\nlike mandatory trailers.\n\n**`<extra-instructions>`** — Additional guidance applied during the commit process.\nThese instructions have highest priority and override plugin defaults. Use for\nproject-specific conventions not covered by the validator.\n\n## Components\n\n| Type | Path | Purpose |\n|------|------|---------|\n| Command | `commands/commit/` | 7-step commit pipeline |\n| Skill | `skills/commit-message/` | Message formatting conventions |\n| Script | `scripts/validate-commit-message.js` | Automated validation |\n\n## Customization\n\n**Message conventions:** Edit `skills/commit-message/SKILL.md` to change formatting rules,\nrequired sections, or scope patterns.\n\n**Validation rules:** Edit `scripts/validate-commit-message.js` to add checks, change severity\nlevels, or adjust thresholds.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
