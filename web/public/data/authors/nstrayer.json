        "README.md": "# Claude Code Planning Plugin\n\nA plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that provides structured planning and implementation workflows with minimal context overhead.\n\n**Key benefit**: Feature-centric workflow with a task document that maintains context across sessions. Parallel sub-agents research your codebase and return precise `file:line` references.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add nstrayer/claude-planning\n\n# Install plugin\n/plugin install bootandshoe@bootandshoe-claude-planning\n```\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph feature[\"Feature-Centric (Multi-Session)\"]\n        F1[\"/feature_start\"] --> F2[\"/feature_plan @task.md\"]\n        F2 --> F3[\"/feature_implement @task.md\"]\n        F3 --> F4[\"/feature_validate @task.md\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph standalone[\"Standalone (One-Off Tasks)\"]\n        S1[\"/feature_plan\"] --> S2[\"/feature_implement\"]\n        S2 --> S3[\"/feature_validate\"]\n    end\n```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/feature_start` | Start new feature with task document and PRD |\n| `/feature_plan` | Interactive planning with codebase research |\n| `/feature_implement` | Execute plans phase-by-phase with verification |\n| `/feature_validate` | Validate implementation against PRD + plan |\n| `/feature_iterate` | Update existing plans based on feedback |\n| `/research` | Spawn parallel agents for codebase research |\n| `/oneshot` | Quick plan-and-execute for simple tasks |\n\n## Agents\n\nSpecialized agents research your codebase in parallel:\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `codebase-locator` | Finds WHERE files and components live |\n| `codebase-analyzer` | Understands HOW code works |\n| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Finds similar implementations to model after |\n| `thoughts-locator` | Discovers relevant documents in `thoughts/` |\n| `thoughts-analyzer` | Extracts insights from `thoughts/` documents |\n| `web-search-researcher` | Researches external documentation and APIs |\n\nAgents are **documentarians** - they describe what exists without suggesting improvements. They return precise `file:line` references rather than full file contents.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Feature Workflow (Multi-Session)\n\n```bash\n# Start feature from GitHub issue\n/feature_start https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123\n\n# Or start without an issue (interactive PRD creation)\n/feature_start\n\n# Create plan (outputs to feature directory)\n/feature_plan @thoughts/features/issue-123-feature/task.md\n\n# Implement the plan\n/feature_implement @thoughts/features/issue-123-feature/task.md\n\n# Validate against both PRD and plan\n/feature_validate @thoughts/features/issue-123-feature/task.md\n```\n\n### Standalone Workflow (One-Off Tasks)\n\n```bash\n# Create a plan interactively\n/feature_plan\n\n# Or from a requirements file\n/feature_plan path/to/requirements.md\n\n# Implement the plan\n/feature_implement thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-08-feature.md\n\n# Validate implementation\n/feature_validate thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-08-feature.md\n```\n\n### Research Only\n\n```bash\n# Research codebase without planning\n/research\n# Then: \"How does authentication work in this codebase?\"\n```\n\n## Output Structure\n\n```\nthoughts/\n├── features/           # Feature-centric workflows\n│   └── {slug}/\n│       ├── task.md     # Context anchor (status, decisions, activity)\n│       ├── prd.md      # Product requirements\n│       └── plan.md     # Implementation plan\n└── shared/\n    ├── plans/          # Standalone plans\n    ├── prds/           # Standalone PRDs\n    └── research/       # Research documents\n```\n\nFeature directories are created by `/feature_start`. The task document maintains context across sessions and tracks status through: `planning` -> `planned` -> `implementing` -> `validating` -> `complete`\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Feature-centric**: Task documents anchor context across sessions\n2. **Parallel research**: Multiple agents research concurrently for efficiency\n3. **Precise references**: Agents return `file:line` references, not full file contents\n4. **Document, don't critique**: Agents describe what exists without suggesting changes\n5. **Separated verification**: Plans distinguish automated checks from manual testing\n"
