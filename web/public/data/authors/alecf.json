        "plugins/blog-profile-analyzer/README.md": "# Blog Profile Analyzer\n\n## Description\n\nAnalyzes blogs and online publications to create comprehensive profiles of authors' perspectives, biases, political leanings, and worldviews. This skill helps you understand the lens through which a blog author sees the world, making it easier to critically evaluate their work.\n\n## Usage\n\nUse this skill when you want to:\n- Understand a blog author's perspective and biases\n- Analyze the political leanings of a publication\n- Profile a blog's worldview and values\n- Compare perspectives across different blogs\n\n### How to Invoke\n\nSimply ask Claude to analyze a blog:\n\n```\nAnalyze the blog at example.substack.com for the author's perspective\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nCan you profile the political leanings of [Blog Name]?\n```\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe skill will:\n1. Fetch and analyze 5-10 representative posts from the blog\n2. Examine the author's \"About\" page if available\n3. Analyze content across multiple dimensions:\n   - Core beliefs and values\n   - Political and ideological leanings\n   - Biases and blind spots\n   - Rhetorical style\n   - Epistemology (how they know what they know)\n4. Create a concise, one-page profile (~800-1000 words)\n5. Save the analysis to a markdown file\n\n## Output\n\nThe skill generates a structured profile including:\n- **Executive Summary**: Quick overview of the author's perspective\n- **Political & Worldview Profile**: Detailed political and ideological analysis\n- **Core Values, Biases & Blind Spots**: What drives the author and what they miss\n- **How to Read This Author**: Practical guidance for critically reading their work\n- **Evidence & Style**: How they argue and what they consider evidence\n- **Key Quotes**: Representative excerpts from their writing\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Analyze a Specific Blog\n```\nUser: Analyze the blog at arctotherium.substack.com for the author's perspective and biases\n\nClaude: I'll analyze that Substack blog to profile the author's perspective.\nLet me start by fetching the main page and then analyze several representative posts.\n\n[Proceeds with comprehensive analysis]\n```\n\n### Example 2: Compare Multiple Blogs\n```\nUser: Compare the political leanings of Marginal Revolution and Astral Codex Ten\n\nClaude: I'll analyze both blogs separately first, then provide a comparison...\n\n[Analyzes each blog and creates comparative summary]\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis skill requires:\n- Internet access (uses WebFetch and WebSearch)\n- Time to complete (multiple web fetches required)\n- Access to blog content (some blogs may be paywalled)\n\n## Notes\n\n- Analysis is objective and descriptive, not judgmental\n- Quality depends on access to representative posts\n- Some blogs may have limited free content\n- Designed for understanding perspectives, not for malicious profiling\n- Works best with blogs that have 5+ accessible posts\n\n## Version History\n\n### 1.0.0\n- Initial release\n- Supports blog profiling with comprehensive analysis framework\n- Generates concise, structured profiles\n- Includes comparative analysis capability\n",
        "plugins/wakey-wakey/README.md": "# wakey-wakey\n\nKeeps your Mac awake during Claude Code sessions.\n\n## What it does\n\nAdds a `PostToolUse` hook that runs after every tool invocation. The hook:\n\n1. Kills any existing `caffeinate` process\n2. Starts a new `caffeinate` process with a 5-minute timeout\n\nThis keeps your Mac awake as long as Claude is actively working, preventing sleep during long-running tasks.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add alecf/claude-skills\n/plugin install wakey-wakey@alecf-claude-skills\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nUses macOS's built-in `caffeinate` command with the `-u` flag (asserts user activity) and a 300-second timeout. Each tool use resets the timer, so your Mac stays awake during active sessions but will sleep normally when Claude is idle.\n"
