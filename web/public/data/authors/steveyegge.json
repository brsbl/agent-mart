        "README.md": "# bd - Beads\n\n**Distributed, git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents.**\n\n**Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD\n\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/steveyegge/beads)](LICENSE)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/steveyegge/beads)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/steveyegge/beads)\n[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/steveyegge/beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/releases)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beads/bd)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beads/bd)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/beads-mcp)](https://pypi.org/project/beads-mcp/)\n\nBeads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.\n\n## ⚡ Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don't clone this repo into your project)\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n\n# Initialize in YOUR project\ncd your-project\nbd init\n\n# Tell your agent\necho \"Use 'bd' for task tracking\" >> AGENTS.md\n```\n\n**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don't need to clone this repository into your project.\n\n## 🛠 Features\n\n* **Git as Database:** Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`. Versioned, branched, and merged like code.\n* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.\n* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.\n* **Invisible Infrastructure:** SQLite local cache for speed; background daemon for auto-sync.\n* **Compaction:** Semantic \"memory decay\" summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.\n\n## 📖 Essential Commands\n\n| Command | Action |\n| --- | --- |\n| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |\n| `bd create \"Title\" -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |\n| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |\n| `bd show <id>` | View task details and audit trail. |\n\n## 🔗 Hierarchy & Workflow\n\nBeads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:\n\n* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)\n* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)\n* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)\n\n**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects.\n\n**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:\n\n* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.\n* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.\n\n## 📦 Installation\n\n* **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`\n* **Homebrew:** `brew install beads`\n* **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`\n\n**Requirements:** Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, or Windows.\n\n## 🌐 Community Tools\n\nSee [docs/COMMUNITY_TOOLS.md](docs/COMMUNITY_TOOLS.md) for a curated list of community-built UIs, extensions, and integrations—including terminal interfaces, web UIs, editor extensions, and native apps.\n\n## 📝 Documentation\n\n* [Installing](docs/INSTALLING.md) | [Agent Workflow](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) | [Copilot Setup](docs/COPILOT_INTEGRATION.md) | [Articles](ARTICLES.md) | [Sync Branch Mode](docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md) | [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) | [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)\n* [![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/steveyegge/beads)\n"
