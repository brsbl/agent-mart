They load on-demand via progressive disclosure and provide:\n\n- **Specialized workflows** — Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n- **Tool integrations** — Scripts and APIs for complex tasks\n- **Domain expertise** — Knowledge, schemas, and business logic\n- **Bundled resources** — References, templates, and assets\n\n## Structure\n\nEach skill lives in its own folder:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required: Instructions and metadata\n├── references/           # Optional: Documentation loaded as needed\n├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable code\n└── assets/               # Optional: Templates, images, etc.\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nSome skills require environment variables. Copy the example file and add your credentials:\n\n```bash\ncp skills/skill-name/.env.example skills/skill-name/.env.local\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThe PRD and Ralph skills (`create-prd`, `create-prd-json`, `ralph`) are inspired by [snarktank/ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph).\n\nThe `fresh-eyes` skill is inspired by [Jeffrey Emanuel](https://x.com/doodlestein/status/1956228999945806049).\n"
