        "README.md": "# Agent Skills\n\nA collection of agent skills for design, engineering, writing, and product, built on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard.\n\n## Install\n\nAdd via skills.sh\n```bash\nnpx skills add richtabor/agent-skills\n```\n\nOr as a Claude Code [plugin]([url](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins))\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/richtabor/agent-skills\n/plugin install rt\n```\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### [Accessibility Review](./skills/accessibility-review)\n\nAudits components, pages, and screenshots against WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA. Returns prioritized findings (Critical/Warning) with specific fixes rather than generic guidance.\n\n### [WordPress Add Links](./skills/wordpress-add-links)\n\nScans a blog post draft, finds relevant internal and external link opportunities, and weaves them into existing sentences without disrupting the flow.\n\n### [Create PRD](./skills/create-prd)\n\nPlans features interactively. Asks clarifying questions, then generates a detailed PRD document with user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical considerations.\n\n### [Ralph: Create JSON Issues](./skills/ralph-json-create-issues)\n\nConverts a PRD or plan file into right-sized JSON stories for the JSON loop. Reads from `.claude/plans/`, `plans/`, or `prds/`, sizes each story to one context window, and wires up cross-PRD dependencies.\n\n### [Fresh Eyes](./skills/fresh-eyes)\n\nRe-reads code you just wrote as if seeing it for the first time. Catches off-by-one errors, missed edge cases, naming issues, and logic bugs, then fixes them on the spot.\n\n### [Humanize](./skills/humanize)\n\nRewrites AI-generated text so it reads like a person wrote it. Applies 30 rules across 6 categories based on Wikipedia's AI writing patterns guide, preserving meaning while removing robotic phrasing.\n\n### [Markdown Image Alt Text](./skills/markdown-img-alt-text)\n\nReads each image in a markdown file, describes its content, and writes detailed alt text inline. Works with both Obsidian wiki-style (`![[image]]`) and standard markdown formats.\n\n### [Motion Design](./skills/motion-design)\n\nEvaluates UI animation needs and recommends specific easing curves, durations, and implementation approaches. Every animation gets a job, or it gets cut.\n\n### [Ralph: GitHub Create Issues](./skills/ralph-github-create-issues)\n\nConverts a PRD or plan file into GitHub Issues (parent + sub-issues). Reads from `.claude/plans/`, `plans/`, or `prds/`, sizes stories for single-context execution, and links dependencies via GitHub's native blocking. This is the workflow I use.\n\n### [Ralph: GitHub Start Loop](./skills/ralph-github-start-loop)\n\nAutonomous development loop powered by GitHub Issues. Fetches open PRD issues, spins up git worktrees, implements stories, closes sub-issues on commit, and opens a PR when done.\n\n### [Ralph: JSON Create Issues](./skills/ralph-json-create-issues)\n\nConverts a PRD or plan file into right-sized JSON stories for the JSON loop. Reads from `.claude/plans/`, `plans/`, or `prds/`, sizes each story to one context window, and wires up cross-PRD dependencies. Learn more at [richtabor.com/ralph](https://richtabor.com/ralph).\n\n### [Ralph: JSON Start Loop](./skills/ralph-json-start-loop)\n\nAutonomous development loop powered by local JSON files. Picks up stories from `.claude/plans/`, `plans/`, or `prds/`, spins up git worktrees, and executes them one by one without manual intervention. Learn more at [richtabor.com/ralph](https://richtabor.com/ralph).\n\n### [Review PR](./skills/review-pr)\n\nReviews PR comments from GitHub (Copilot, reviewers), evaluates them against actual code, replies with reasoning, and resolves threads.\n\n### [Review AGENTS.md](./skills/review-agents-md)\n\nDetects missing `AGENTS.md` files, creates them using progressive disclosure principles, and symlinks `CLAUDE.md`. Proactively checks new projects and handles all combinations of existing files.\n\n### [Skill Review](./skills/skill-review)\n\nValidates agent skills against the Agent Skills standard. Audits structure, frontmatter, description quality, progressive disclosure, and anti-patterns, then returns a scored report with actionable fixes.\n\n### [Technical Writing](./skills/technical-writing)\n\nTurns the feature you just built into a technical blog post. Analyzes your codebase for implementation details, structures the narrative, and avoids AI-sounding language. Supports WordPress publishing.\n\n### [X Writing](./skills/x-writing)\n\nTurns notes and ideas into X posts that sound like you wrote them. Pulls ideas from a markdown file (`X_SOURCE_FILE`) or macOS Notes (`X_NOTES_APP_SOURCE`), identifies the most shareable angle, and drafts posts matched to your voice. Saves approved posts to `X_DRAFTS_FILE`.\n\n## Structure\n\nEach skill lives in its own folder:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required: Instructions and metadata\n├── references/           # Optional: Documentation loaded as needed\n├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable code\n└── assets/               # Optional: Templates, images, etc.\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThe PRD and Ralph skills (`ralph-json-create-issues`, `ralph-json-start-loop`) are inspired by [snarktank/ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph).\n\nThe `fresh-eyes` skill is inspired by [Jeffrey Emanuel](https://x.com/doodlestein/status/1956228999945806049).\n"
