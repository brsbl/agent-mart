        "README.md": "# Agent Skill Kit\n\nA collection of reusable skills for AI coding agents.\nShare, discover, and compose skills that make your agent smarter.\n\nCompatible with [SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com) | Claude Code | Codex CLI | ChatGPT\n\nThis project follows the official [Anthropic Agent Skills Specification](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) and is registered as a Claude Code plugin marketplace.\n\n## How It Works\n\nSkills are defined as `SKILL.md` files — structured markdown documents that AI agents automatically recognize and execute. Each skill encodes a specific workflow (e.g., conducting a requirements interview and producing a specification document), turning a multi-step process into a single command.\n\n- **Agent-native**: Skills are plain markdown with frontmatter metadata. Any agent that reads files can pick them up.\n- **Self-contained**: Each skill lives in its own directory with everything it needs — instructions, examples, and output templates.\n- **Composable**: Skills are independent units. Use one at a time or chain them together for complex workflows.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [spec-interview](skills/spec-interview/SKILL.md) | Transforms vague requirements into actionable specifications (`SPEC.md`) through structured multi-round interviews | ✅ |\n| [release-notes](skills/release-notes/SKILL.md) | Analyzes git history to generate structured release notes (`RELEASE_NOTES.md`) with categorized changes and contributors | ✅ |\n\n> ✅ Ready | 🚧 In Progress | 📋 Planned\n\n## Agents\n\nAgents are autonomous task executors that can be invoked via the Task tool in Claude Code. They are defined in `.claude/agents/` directory.\n\n| Agent | Description | Tools | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [load-test](.claude/agents/load-test.md) | k6 load test execution and automated report generation with performance metrics | Bash, Read, Write, Glob | ✅ |\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n\"Run API load test\"\n\"Execute k6 performance test\"\n```\n\n**Trigger Keywords:** load test, performance test, k6, stress test\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/spec-interview\n```\n\nThe skill will automatically discover requirement files (`SPEC.md`, `PRD.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, etc.) in your project and begin the interview process.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/kangminhyuk1111/agent-skill-kit.git\n\n# 2. Copy the skills you want into your project\ncp -r agent-skill-kit/skills/spec-interview /your-project/skills/\n\n# 3. Invoke the skill from your agent\n/spec-interview\n```\n\nAlternatively, clone the entire repository and symlink individual skill directories into your projects as needed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nNew skill contributions are welcome. To add a skill:\n\n1. Create a new directory under `skills/`:\n   ```\n   skills/\n   └── your-skill-name/\n       └── SKILL.md\n   ```\n\n2. Write your `SKILL.md` with the following structure:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   name: your-skill-name\n   description: A short one-line description of what the skill does.\n   ---\n\n   # Skill Title\n\n   ## Overview\n   What the skill does and when to use it.\n\n   ## Instructions\n   Step-by-step instructions the agent will follow.\n\n   ## Examples\n   Input/output examples demonstrating the skill.\n\n   ## Guidelines\n   Best practices and constraints.\n   ```\n\n3. Register the skill in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` by adding it to the appropriate plugin group:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"your-plugin-group\",\n     \"description\": \"Group description\",\n     \"source\": \"./\",\n     \"strict\": false,\n     \"skills\": [\n       \"./skills/your-skill-name\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.
