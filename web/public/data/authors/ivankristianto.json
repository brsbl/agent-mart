        "README.md": "# k2-dev - Multiagent Development Orchestration\n\nEnterprise-grade multiagent orchestration plugin for Claude Code that manages end-to-end software development workflows with specialized AI agents.\n\n## Overview\n\nk2-dev simulates a complete development team with specialized agents and skills:\n\n**Agents:**\n\n- **Technical Lead**: Orchestrates workflows, manages worktrees\n- **Engineer**: Implements features following plans\n- **PR Writer**: Creates well-structured pull requests\n- **Reviewer**: Performs code reviews and quality validation\n\n**Skills (main conversation context):**\n\n- **Planning**: Analyzes requirements, creates actionable plans\n- **Test Planning**: Creates test plans and validates implementations\n\n## Features\n\n- 🎯 **Task-Driven Development**: Integrated with beads task management\n- 🌲 **Git Worktree Workflow**: Isolated workspaces for each task\n- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Enforces standards from AGENTS.md\n- 🔄 **Structured Workflows**: Planning → Implementation → PR Creation → Review → Merge\n- 📋 **Automated Reporting**: Track progress and generate status reports\n- 🧪 **Test Planning**: Automated test strategy and coverage planning\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) - Task management system\n- [beads_viewer](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) - Interactive task viewer for beads (`bv` command)\n- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) - Command-line tool for GitHub operations (`gh` command)\n- Git with worktree support\n- Project configuration files (optional but recommended):\n  - `AGENTS.md` - Agent behavior guidelines\n  - `constitution.md` - Project principles and constraints\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall via Claude Marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install k2-dev@ivankristianto/k2-dev\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/k2:start`\n\nStart implementation workflow for one or more tickets.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```\n/k2:start beads-123 [--skip-worktree]\n/k2:start beads-123,beads-234,beads-345 [--skip-worktree]\n/k2:start [--skip-worktree] # No ticket - launches beads_viewer (bv) for interactive selection\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n- `--skip-worktree`: Create branch in main repository instead of creating an isolated worktree\n\n**Interactive Mode:**\n\nWhen called without a ticket ID, `/k2:start` will launch the `bv` (beads_viewer) command for interactive task selection. This provides a visual interface to browse and select tasks from your beads project.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Technical Lead validates tickets exist\n2. Creates git worktree (branch: `feature/beads-{id}`) or creates branch in main repo if `--skip-worktree` is used\n3. Reads task description and comments\n4. Hands off to Engineer for implementation\n5. Engineer implements with self-review\n6. Creates GitHub PR automatically\n7. Reviewer validates against quality gates\n8. Iterates up to 2 times if needed\n9. Creates follow-up tickets for remaining issues\n10. Technical Lead merges and cleans up\n\n### `/k2:planner`\n\nStart planning workflow for new features using the Planning skill.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```\n/k2:planner\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Planning skill analyzes requirement with full codebase access\n2. Asks clarifying questions directly in main conversation\n3. Creates initial plan\n4. Invokes Technical Lead agent for architectural review\n5. Planning skill incorporates feedback and refines plan\n6. Converts to beads tasks with dependencies\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Faster execution (no agent spawning overhead)\n- Easier debugging (everything in main conversation context)\n- Direct user interaction (questions asked directly)\n\n### `/k2:report`\n\nGenerate status report for a ticket.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```\n/k2:report beads-123\n```\n\n**Output:** Structured markdown report with:\n\n- Task summary\n- Current status\n- Assignee\n- Comments and history\n- Related tickets\n\n### `/k2:test`\n\nCreate test plan for a ticket using the Test Planning skill.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```\n/k2:test beads-123\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. Test Planning skill analyzes implementation\n2. Creates comprehensive test plan\n3. Defines test cases and coverage strategy\n4. Adds test plan to beads comments\n5. Coordinates with Engineer for implementation\n\n### `/k2:doctor`\n\nCheck system prerequisites and project configuration.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```\n/k2:doctor\n```\n\n**What it checks:**\n\n- **System Prerequisites**: Verifies `bd` (beads), `bv` (beads_viewer), `gh` (GitHub CLI), and `git` with worktree support are installed\n- **Project Configuration**: Checks for `AGENTS.md` and `constitution.md` files\n- **Beads Setup**: Validates `.beads/` directory and beads operational status\n- **Beads Task Statistics**: Analyzes task health (open/closed/tombstone counts) and suggests maintenance with `bd compact` if needed\n\n**Output:** Diagnostic report showing which requirements are met, missing, or need attention, plus actionable recommendations for beads maintenance.\n\n## Agents\n\n### Technical Lead\n\n- **Role**: Workflow orchestrator and system architect\n- **Responsibilities**:\n  - Validate ticket status\n  - Create and manage git worktrees\n  - Coordinate agent handoffs (hub model)\n  - Make architectural decisions\n  - Merge PRs and cleanup\n- **Tools**: All tools, full codebase access\n\n### Engineer\n\n- **Role**: Implementation specialist\n- **Responsibilities**:\n  -

Validates tickets exist and are open\n  - Creates worktree (feature/beads-123) or branch (--skip-worktree)\n  - Reads task descriptions and context\n    ↓\nEngineer:\n  - Implements changes following plan\n  - Self-reviews against quality gates\n  - Pushes changes to feature branch\n    ↓\nPR Writer:\n  - Analyzes changes and commit history\n  - Generates description from templates/context\n  - Creates GitHub Pull Request\n    ↓\nReviewer:\n  - Reviews code changes\n  - Validates against AGENTS.md\n  - Provides feedback on GitHub PR\n    ↓\n[Iteration: max 2 times]\n    ↓\nTechnical Lead:\n  - Merges approved PR\n  - Closes beads tasks & syncs\n  - Removes worktree/branch\n  - Provides final report\n```\n\n**Why PR Creation Uses Internal Subagent:**\n\n- Separates PR creation logic from implementation and review\n- Ensures consistent PR formatting and template usage\n- Reduces context overhead for subsequent agents\n\n### Planning Workflow\n\n```\nUser: /k2:planner \"Add user authentication\"\n    ↓\nPlanning Skill (main conversation context):\n  - Analyzes requirement\n  - Explores codebase\n  - Asks clarifying questions directly\n  - Creates initial plan\n    ↓\nPlanning Skill invokes Technical Lead agent:\n  - Reviews plan\n  - Provides architectural feedback\n    ↓\nPlanning Skill:\n  - Refines plan\n  - Iterates with Tech Lead\n  - Converts to beads tasks\n  - Sets up dependencies\n  - Adds detailed descriptions\n```\n\n## Hooks\n\n### PreToolUse Hook\n\nValidates file changes against quality gates before Write/Edit operations.\n\n- Checks file patterns defined in AGENTS.md\n- Enforces project standards from AGENTS.md\n- Blocks non-compliant changes\n\n### Stop Hook\n\nRuns cleanup on session end:\n\n- Always executes `bd sync`\n- Ensures task state is synchronized\n- Logs session summary\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always define quality gates** in AGENTS.md for your project\n2. **Keep beads tasks updated** with clear descriptions and plans\n3. **Use hierarchical tasks** for complex features\n4. **Set dependencies** between tasks to maintain order\n5. **Review AGENTS.md** regularly and keep it current\n6. **Follow PR templates** for consistency\n7. **Create follow-up tickets** rather than extending reviews beyond 2 iterations\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Ticket Validation Fails\n\n- Ensure ticket exists: `bd show beads-123`\n- Check ticket is open: `bd list --filter=id:beads-123`\n- Verify beads is synced: `bd sync`\n\n### Worktree Creation Fails\n\n- Check git worktree list: `git worktree list`\n- Remove stale worktrees: `git worktree prune`\n- Ensure branch name doesn't conflict\n\n### Quality Gate Validation Issues\n\n- Review AGENTS.md file patterns\n- Check if files match validation patterns\n- Verify standards in AGENTS.md are achievable\n\n### Agent Coordination Issues\n\n- All coordination happens through Technical Lead (hub model)\n- Check Technical Lead has access to required tools\n- Verify agent descriptions are clear\n\n## Development\n\n### Adding New Agents\n\nAdd new agent `.md` files to `agents/` directory following the template.\n\n### Adding New Skills\n\nCreate skill directories under `skills/` with `SKILL.md` files.\n\n### Customizing Workflows\n\nModify agent system prompts and coordination logic in agent files.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues and questions, please refer to your project's support channels.\n"
