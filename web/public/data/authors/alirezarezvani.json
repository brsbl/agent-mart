Strategic Validation\nRuthlessly validate plans, roadmaps, or proposals before committing resources.\n\n```bash\n/validate my Q2 roadmap: migrate to microservices, add real-time features, launch mobile app\n```\n\n**Output**: 8-section validation report with verdict (GOOD / NEEDS MAJOR WORK / BAD), critical flaws, blindspots, and concrete next steps.\n\n### `/design` - Architecture Design\nDesign comprehensive system architecture with technology recommendations.\n\n```bash\n/design real-time notification system for e-commerce platform with 100K users\n```\n\n**Output**: Executive summary, system architecture, technology stack with trade-offs, implementation roadmap, risk assessment.\n\n### `/decide` - Strategic Decisions\nGet help with build vs buy, technology choices, and prioritization dilemmas.\n\n```bash\n/decide should we use OpenAI API or host our own LLM for customer support chatbot\n```\n\n**Output**: Decision framework, TCO analysis, risk assessment, clear recommendation with rationale.\n\n### `/cto` -

available in all your projects!\n\n### Option 2: Clone to Project\n\nIf you prefer project-specific installation:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-cto-team.git\n\n# Copy the plugin components to your project's .claude folder\ncp -r claude-cto-team/agents /path/to/your/project/.claude/\ncp -r claude-cto-team/commands /path/to/your/project/.claude/\ncp -r claude-cto-team/skills /path/to/your/project/.claude/\n```\n\n### Plugin Structure\n\n```\nclaude-cto-team/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json            # Plugin manifest\n├── agents/                    # AI subagents\n│   ├── cto-architect.md\n│   ├── cto-orchestrator.md\n│   └── strategic-cto-mentor.md\n├── commands/                  # Slash commands\n│   ├── cto.md\n│   ├── decide.md\n│   ├── design.md\n│   └── validate.md\n└── skills/                    # Agent skills\n    ├── architecture-pattern-selector/\n    ├── assumption-challenger/\n    ├── antipattern-detector/\n    ├── clarification-protocol/\n    ├── cost-estimator/\n    ├── delegation-prompt-crafter/\n    ├── ml-cv-specialist/\n    ├── request-analyzer/\n    ├── roadmap-generator/\n    ├── scalability-advisor/\n    ├── tech-stack-recommender/\n    └── validation-report-generator/\n```\n\nThe agents and commands are automatically available in Claude Code after installation.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Architecture Design Request\n> \"I want to build a mobile app that uses computer vision to identify plants. We expect 100K users in the first year.\"\n\n→ Routes to **cto-architect** for comprehensive architecture design with ML pipeline recommendations\n\n### Strategic Plan Validation\n> \"Here's my draft Q2 roadmap: migrate to Kubernetes, implement real-time features, refactor payments, launch mobile app.\"\n\n→ Routes to **strategic-cto-mentor** for ruthless stress-testing and timeline reality check\n\n### Build vs Buy Decision\n> \"Should we use OpenAI's API or host our own LLM? We're processing 50K conversations per month.\"\n\n→ Routes to **strategic-cto-mentor** for TCO analysis and trade-off evaluation\n\n## Author\n\n**Alireza Rezvani**\n\n[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-alirezarezvani.com-blue)](https://alirezarezvani.com)\n[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-alirezarezvani-0077B5?logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alirezarezvani/)\n[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-@alirezarezvani-12100E?logo=medium)](https://alirezarezvani.medium.com/)\n\n- Website: [alirezarezvani.com](https://alirezarezvani.com)\n- LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/alirezarezvani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alirezarezvani/)\n- Medium: [alirezarezvani.medium.com](https://alirezarezvani.medium.com/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
