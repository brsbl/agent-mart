        "README.md": "# Expanly Claude Code Agents\n\nExpanly's internal collection of **production-ready Claude Code agents** covering full-stack development, DevOps, data science, security, and more.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Install via Claude Code Plugin Marketplace\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add expanly/expanly-claude-code-agents\n\n# Browse available plugins\n/plugin\n\n# Install specific plugins\n/plugin install backend-developer@expanly-claude-code-agents\n/plugin install python-pro@expanly-claude-code-agents\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Browse the `plugins/` directory to find the agent you need\n2. Copy the agent's `.md` file from `plugins/{agent-name}/agents/`\n3. Place it in your project's `.claude/agents/` directory\n\n## Using Commands\n\nEach agent has a command for quick invocation:\n\n```bash\n# With a task\n/backend-developer Build a REST API for user management\n\n# Interactive mode (no task)\n/python-pro\n```\n\n### Combining Natural Language and Commands \nYou can mix both approaches for optimal flexibility:\n\n```bash\n# Start with a command for structured workflow\n/debugger \"Logs show error X\"\n\n# Then provide natural language guidance\n\"1. Ensure docker container is updated\"\n\"2. Verify all .env variables are set\"\n\"3. Check the logs for other related information\"\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n#### When to Use Slash Commands\n- Structured workflows - Multi-step processes with clear phases\n- Repetitive tasks - Operations you perform frequently\n- Precise control - When you need specific parameters\n- Discovery - Exploring available functionality\n\n#### When to Use Natural Language\n- Exploratory work - When you're not sure which tool to use\n- Complex reasoning - When Claude needs to coordinate multiple agents\n- Contextual decisions - When the right approach depends on the situation\n- Ad-hoc tasks - One-off operations that don't fit a command\n\n### Workflow Composition\nCompose multiple plugins for complex scenarios:\n\n```\n# 1. Prompt the agent-organizer with the task / feature\n/agent-organizer \"Lets implement this task with the following agents. Your task is to manage and provide context to them.\"\n\n# 2. Start with the UX research\n/ux-researcher \"Make a UX plan for this task\"\n\n# 3. Add UI design\n/ui-designer \"Use our design guidelines and plan the design\"\n\n# 4. Plan the fullstack task\n/fullstack-developer \"Generate two separate isolated tasks one for the backend and one for frontend\"\n\n# 5. Build the API\n/backend-developer \"Build the backend for this task\"\n\n# 6. Build the frontend\n/frontend-developer \"Build the frontend using the API from the backend-developer agent\"\n\n# 7. Review the implementation\n/code-reviewer\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\n### Core Development\n\n- [**api-designer**](plugins/api-designer/) - API architecture expert designing scalable interfaces\n- [**backend-developer**](plugins/backend-developer/) -
