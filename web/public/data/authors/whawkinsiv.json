Claude Code or Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.\n\n### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)\n\nIn Claude Code, register the marketplace first:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add whawkinsiv/solo-founder-superpowers\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from this marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin install solo-founder-superpowers@solo-founder-superpowers-marketplace\n```\n\n### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)\n\nIn Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin-add solo-founder-superpowers\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nStart a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something that should trigger a skill (for example, \"help me validate this idea\" or \"help me plan this feature\"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant solo-founder-superpowers skill.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### Development & Technical (10 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **build** | AI-assisted dev workflows, tool selection (Claude Code, Lovable, Replit, Cursor) |\n| **database** | Data modeling, schemas, relationships, Supabase/Firebase/Airtable setup |\n| **integrations** | APIs, webhooks, Zapier/Make, connecting third-party services |\n| **ai-features** | Adding AI/LLM capabilities to your product, cost management |\n| **deploy** | Hosting selection, custom domains, environment variables, going live |\n| **secure** | Security checklists, OWASP Top 10, auth and data protection |\n| **test** | Test scenarios, edge cases, cross-browser testing |\n| **debug** | Systematic debugging, error interpretation, diagnostics |\n| **optimize** | Speed, code, database, and dependency optimization |\n| **monitor** | Production monitoring, error alerts, incident response |\n\n### Design & UX (5 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **design** | Design systems, UI patterns, visual hierarchy, components, mobile-first |\n| **brand** | Brand identity, color palettes, typography, logos, design tokens |\n| **navigation** | App navigation, content hierarchy, menus, findability |\n| **onboarding** | Onboarding flows, aha moments, activation rates, first-run UX |\n| **accessibility** | WCAG compliance, ARIA, screen readers, keyboard navigation |\n\n### SEO & Content (4 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **seo** | Keyword research, content calendars, on-page optimization |\n| **technical-seo** | SEO audits, Core Web Vitals, GEO for AI search engines |\n| **content** | Content strategy, build in public, audience building, distribution |\n| **copywriting** | Headlines, CTAs, button text, error messages, UI copy |\n\n### Growth & Marketing (9 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **launch** | Product Hunt, waitlists, beta programs, GTM sequencing |\n| **landing-page** | Page structure, above-the-fold copy, conversion elements |\n| **growth** | Product-led growth, viral loops, activation metrics, referrals |\n| **conversion** | Funnel analysis, friction reduction, A/B testing |\n| **email** | Email sequences, onboarding drips, behavioral triggers |\n| **ads** | Google Ads, ad copy, keyword selection, CAC/LTV optimization |\n| **sales** | Cold outreach, prospect lists, landing the first 100 customers |\n| **social-media** | Platform-specific tactics: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit, short-form video |\n| **community** | Discord/Slack communities, user forums, community-led growth |\n\n### Strategy & Planning (8 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **plan** | Turn ideas into buildable specs, MVPs, feature requirements |\n| **validate** | Pre-build validation: smoke tests, fake door tests, concierge MVPs |\n| **customer-research** | User interviews, JTBD framework, behavioral personas |\n| **market-research** | Market sizing, competitor analysis, TAM/SAM/SOM |\n| **pricing** | Pricing tiers, value metrics, psychology, monetization |\n| **prioritize** | Feature prioritization, roadmaps, RICE scoring, MVP definition |\n| **feedback** | Post-launch feedback collection, NPS, feature requests |\n| **analytics** | Event tracking, funnels, key metrics, data quality |\n\n### Business Operations (7 skills)\n\n| Skill | What It Covers |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **legal** | Entity formation, ToS, Privacy Policy, compliance |\n| **finances** | Financial models, unit economics, MRR/ARR/churn, burn rate |\n| **accounting** | Bookkeeping, expense tracking, quarterly taxes, invoicing |\n| **payments** | Stripe setup, subscriptions, billing, tax collection |\n| **hiring** | Developer sourcing, vetting contractors, briefs, management |\n| **support** | Help docs, knowledge bases, self-serve support |\n| **retention** | Churn prevention, win-back campaigns, expansion revenue |\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **improve-prompt** | Transforms vague coding requests into detailed, specific prompts |\n\n## How to Use\n\nSkills are invoked automatically when Claude Code detects a relevant request, or manually:\n\n```\n/solo-founder-superpowers:plan\n/solo-founder-superpowers:launch\n/solo-founder-superpowers:payments\n```\n\n### Recommended workflow for a new product\n\n```\n1.
