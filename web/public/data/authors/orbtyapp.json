        "README.md": "# Orbty-eazy\n\nOrbty-eazy is a complete software development workflow for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable \"skills\" and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.\n\n## How it works\n\nIt starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it _doesn't_ just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do.\n\nOnce it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest.\n\nAfter you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.\n\nNext up, once you say \"go\", it launches a _subagent-driven-development_ process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\n\nThere's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Orbty-eazy.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nIf Orbty-eazy has helped you do stuff that makes money and you are so inclined, I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring my opensource work](https://github.com/sponsors/obra).\n\nThanks!\n\n- Jesse\n\n## Installation\n\n**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code has a built-in plugin system. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.\n\n### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)\n\nIn Claude Code, register the marketplace first:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add obra/orbty-eazy-marketplace\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from this marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install orbty-eazy@orbty-eazy-marketplace\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nCheck that commands appear:\n\n```bash\n/help\n```\n\n```\n# Should see:\n# /orbty-eazy:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement\n# /orbty-eazy:write-plan - Create implementation plan\n# /orbty-eazy:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches\n```\n\n### Codex\n\nTell Codex:\n\n```\nFetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/orbty-eazy/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md\n```\n\n**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.codex.md](docs/README.codex.md)\n\n### OpenCode\n\nTell OpenCode:\n\n```\nFetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/orbty-eazy/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md\n```\n\n**Detailed docs:** [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)\n\n## The Basic Workflow\n\n1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.\n\n2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.\n\n3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.\n\n4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.\n\n5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.\n\n6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.\n\n7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.\n\n**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### Skills Library\n\n**Testing**\n\n- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle (includes testing anti-patterns reference)\n\n**Debugging**\n\n- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)\n- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed\n\n**Collaboration**\n\n- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement\n- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans\n- **executing-plans** - Batch execution with checkpoints\n- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Concurrent subagent workflows\n- **requesting-code-review** - Pre-review checklist\n- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback\n- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches\n- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow\n- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)\n\n**Meta**\n\n- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)\n- **using-orbty-eazy** - Introduction to the skills system\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always\n- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing\n- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal\n- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success\n\nRead more: [Orbty-eazy for Claude Code](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/orbty-eazy/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSkills live directly in this repository.
