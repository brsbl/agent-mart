        "README.md": "# ContextGraph Plugin for Claude Code\n\nYour context graph is a **living planning layer** that self-improves with every agentic execution. It provides:\n\n1. **Low-friction planning input**: Vibe-like, natural language planning that integrates everywhere you work\n2. **Living, responsive planning layer**: Plans that improve and evolve with every agentic execution, learning optimal action sizing and context relevance\n3. **Self-documenting outputs**: Automatically generates tailored documentation for different purposes and personas\n\nThe system transforms free-form ideas into optimally-sized, executable actions with just-right context, eliminates wasted tokens and retry loops, and captures the full story of your work's evolution.\n\n## Installation\n\nVia the `/plugin` menu in Claude Code:\n1. Select \"Manage marketplaces\"\n2. Add marketplace: `contextgraph/claude-code-plugin`\n3. Select \"Browse and install plugins\"\n4. Install `contextgraph`\n\nThen restart Claude Code.\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nCheck that everything is working:\n\n```bash\n/mcp\n```\n\nYou should see `contextgraph` listed as a configured MCP server.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Persistent Action Management**: Create, update, and track actions across sessions\n- **Hierarchical Planning**: Organize work in parent-child relationships\n- **Dependency Tracking**: Manage action dependencies and execution order\n- **Semantic Search**: Find actions using natural language queries\n- **Completion Context**: Rich completion stories with technical changes and outcomes\n- **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol support for seamless Claude Code integration\n\n## MCP Tools Available\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can use these tools:\n\n- `create` - Create new actions with parent and dependency relationships\n- `update` - Update action properties including agentReady, dependencies, and completion context\n- `complete` - Mark actions as done with completion context\n- `search` - Search actions using semantic similarity and keywords\n- `fetch` - Get full details for specific actions\n- `list_agent_runs` - List agent runs for an action with filtering options\n- `fetch_agent_run` - Get detailed agent run information including event logs\n- `move` - Reorganize action hierarchy\n- `suggest_parent` - Get AI-powered parent suggestions\n- `parse_plan` - Convert unstructured text into structured actions\n- `fetch_tree` - View hierarchical action trees\n\n## Agent-Ready Status\n\nThe `agentReady` field allows programmatic control over whether an action subtree is ready for autonomous agent execution. This field can be toggled via the MCP `update` tool without requiring web UI access or direct database modifications.\n\n### Purpose\n\nUse `agentReady` to control which action subtrees are available for autonomous agent execution. When set to `false`, the action and its entire subtree are hidden from agent selection, even if they meet other readiness criteria.\n\n### Usage Patterns\n\n**Temporarily blocking agent execution:**\n```javascript\n// Mark an action as not ready for agents\nupdate({\n  action_id: \"action-uuid\",\n  agentReady: false\n})\n```\n\n**Re-enabling agent execution:**\n```javascript\n// Make the action available to agents again\nupdate({\n  action_id: \"action-uuid\",\n  agentReady: true\n})\n```\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n- **Work in progress**: Block agent execution while you refine an action's description or requirements\n- **Human review required**: Mark actions that need human decision-making before agent work can proceed\n- **Dependency resolution**: Keep actions blocked until prerequisite work or decisions are complete\n- **Quality gates**: Control when autonomous work can begin on specific subtrees\n\n### How It Works\n\nWhen an action has `agentReady: false`:\n- The action won't appear in agent selection interfaces\n- Child actions are also blocked from agent execution (inherited blocking)\n- The action remains visible in the web UI and API responses\n- Manual agent execution can still be triggered via the web UI if needed\n\nThis field complements other readiness signals (dependencies, prepared status, etc.) to give you fine-grained control over autonomous execution flow.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter installation, Claude Code can help you:\n\n1. **Create your first action**:\n   ```\n   Create an action to implement user authentication\n   ```\n\n2. **Search existing work**:\n   ```\n   Find actions related to database migrations\n   ```\n\n3. **Complete work and capture context**:\n   ```\n   Mark action [id] as complete with the changes we just made\n   ```\n\n## Web Dashboard\n\nVisit [contextgraph.dev](https://contextgraph.dev) to view and manage your actions in a visual interface.\n\n## Links\n\n- **Website**: [contextgraph.dev](https://contextgraph.dev)\n- **GitHub**: [github.com/contextgraph](https://github.com/contextgraph)\n- **MCP Server**: [mcp.contextgraph.dev](https://mcp.contextgraph.dev)\n\n## Version\n\nCurrent version: 0.9.2\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
