Enforces spec-first, one-test-at-a-time\nTDD through three layers: a PreToolUse guard hook, a git pre-commit gate, and slash commands\nthat embed the red-green-refactor loop.\n\n## Install\n\n**From GitHub** (requires the repo to be public):\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add dominik-rehse/stdd\n/plugin install stdd@stdd\n```\n\nThe first command registers the repo as a marketplace; the second installs the plugin.\n\n**Local / development** (no GitHub required):\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./stdd\n```\n\nOnce Claude Code starts, run `/stdd:setup` in your project to finish initialisation (see\n[Quick start](#quick-start) below).\n\n## How it works\n\n### Three enforcement layers\n\n| Layer | What it does | When it fires |\n|---|---|---|\n| **PreToolUse hook** | Blocks writes of new `src/` files unless a spec *and* a test already exist | Every `Write` call during the session |\n| **Git pre-commit** | Blocks commits while any test is failing | `git commit` |\n| **Slash commands** | Walk you through spec creation and the TDD loop | Invoked explicitly |\n\n### The guard hook in detail\n\nThe hook gates **new** files in `src/` only. It does not block:\n\n- Edits to files that already exist\n- Writes outside `src/`\n- Test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*`, `*_spec.*`) — these are the RED-phase\n  artifact and must be writable *before* the implementation file\n- Any write while a `.tdd-in-progress` marker is present (created and removed by `/stdd:tdd`)\n\nTo pass the gate without the marker, two prerequisites must exist:\n\n1. A spec at `docs/specs/<feature>.md`\n2. A test file — either co-located (`src/<feature>.test.<ext>`) or in `tests/`\n\nFeature names map flexibly: `src/my_feature.ts` matches both `docs/specs/my_feature.md`\nand `docs/specs/my-feature.md`.\n\n### Turning the guard off\n\nCreate an empty `.stdd-off` file in the project root to disable the guard hook entirely.\nRemove it to re-enable. The file is gitignored — the switch is per-developer, not\nchecked in.\n\n```bash\ntouch .stdd-off   # off\nrm .stdd-off      # back on\n```\n\n### Supported test frameworks\n\n`run-tests.sh` detects and runs whichever framework the project uses:\n\n| Framework | Detected by | Command |\n|---|---|---|\n| pytest | `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` / `pytest.ini` | `python -m pytest tests/ -v` |\n| Bun | `bun.lockb` | `bun test` |\n| Node (npm) | `package.json` (no `bun.lockb`) | `npm test` |\n| Go | `go.mod` | `go test ./...` |\n| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` |\n| Ruby | `Gemfile` | `bundle exec rspec` |\n\nBun is checked before Node because both projects have a `package.json`.\n\n## Quick start\n\n```text\n/stdd:setup          ← run once per project (creates dirs, installs hooks and rules)\n/stdd:spec <name>    ← guided interview that writes docs/specs/<name>.md\n/stdd:tdd  <name>    ← runs the red-green-refactor loop against that spec\n```\n\n### 1. Initialise the project\n\n```\n/stdd:setup\n```\n\nCreates `docs/specs/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, installs `scripts/run-tests.sh` and\n`.git/hooks/pre-commit`, and writes `.claude/rules/stdd.md` so the workflow rules are\nalways in context.\n\nSafe to re-run — existing files are not overwritten.\n\n### 2. Write a spec\n\n```\n/stdd:spec calculator\n```\n\nClaude asks four questions (problem, inputs/outputs, behaviour, acceptance criteria) and\nwrites `docs/specs/calculator.md` — as detailed as the feature warrants.\n\n### 3. Implement with TDD\n\n```\n/stdd:tdd calculator\n```\n\nWorks through each acceptance criterion **one at a time**:\n\n```\nRED      write one failing test          → run tests (must fail)\nGREEN    write the minimum code          → run tests (must pass)\nREFACTOR clean up what you just wrote    → run tests (must still pass)\n         ↳ back to RED for the next criterion\n```\n\nThe loop creates a `.tdd-in-progress` marker so the guard hook allows `src/` writes\nduring implementation. The marker is removed at the end.\n\n## Project layout after setup\n\n```\ndocs/specs/        specs (one .md per feature)\nsrc/               implementation + co-located tests (*.test.<ext>)\ntests/             tests (alternative to co-location)\nscripts/\n  run-tests.sh     language-agnostic test runner\n.git/hooks/\n  pre-commit       blocks commits while tests fail\n.claude/rules/\n  stdd.md          workflow rules (always in context)\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---|---|\n| `/stdd:setup` | One-time project initialisation |\n| `/stdd:spec <name>` | Guided spec creation |\n| `/stdd:tdd <name>` | Red-green-refactor loop |\n\n## References\n\n- [Claude Code plugins — create and distribute a marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces)\n- [Claude Code plugins — discover and install](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins)\n"
