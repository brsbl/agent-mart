(one sentence)\n2. **Why** does it matter? (the problem it solves)\n3. **Priority** relative to existing items\n4. **Dependencies** on other roadmap items\n\nKeep it brief. This is idea capture, not implementation planning.\n\n## Step 3: Create Roadmap Entry\n\nCreate a new file in `.claude/planning/roadmap/`:\n\n- Use next available number (e.g., `05-feature-name.md`)\n- Keep it concise:\n\n```markdown\n# Feature Name\n\n## Overview\n1-2 paragraphs: what this does and why it matters.\n\n## Priority\nP0/P1/P2 with one-sentence justification.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: [list specs that must come first]\n- Enables: [list specs that depend on this]\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n- **In**: [key things included]\n- **Out**: [explicitly excluded for now]\n```\n\n## Step 4: Update Roadmap\n\nAdd the new entry to `.claude/planning/roadmap/roadmap.toml`.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- **This is quick capture, not spec building.** Keep it under 5 minutes.\n- Save deep technical details for `/interview-spec` when ready to implement.\n- Focus on \"what\" and \"why\", defer \"how\" to spec phase.\n- One paragraph beats three. Brevity is a feature.\n",
