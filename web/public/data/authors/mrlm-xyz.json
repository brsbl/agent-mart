        "README.md": "# Claude Code Private Marketplace Demo\n\n> A teaching project that shows how to build a private plugin marketplace for Claude Code. Contains two example plugins with agents, commands, and skills -- everything you need to understand the plugin architecture and start building your own.\n\n## What This Demo Shows\n\nIf you have been looking at Claude Code plugins and wondering \"how do I actually structure a private marketplace for my team?\" -- this is your reference. The repository demonstrates:\n\n- How to create a **marketplace manifest** (`marketplace.json`) that lists and distributes plugins\n- How to structure **plugins** with agents, commands, and skills\n- How plugins, project config (`CLAUDE.md`), and settings work together to form the full Claude Code experience\n\nThis is a demo. The plugins here are illustrative -- they show the correct file structure and conventions, not production-ready tooling. Use this as a starting point, then refer to the official docs linked below for the full specification.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ndemo-claude-marketplace/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json          # Marketplace manifest -- lists all plugins\n├── claude-plugins/\n│   ├── data-toolkit/\n│   │   ├── .claude-plugin/\n│   │   │   └── plugin.json       # Plugin metadata (name, description, version)\n│   │   ├── agents/               # Subagent definitions (data-engineer, pipeline-architect)\n│   │   ├── commands/             # Slash commands (ingest, transform)\n│   │   └── skills/               # Skills organized by domain (sql/, etl/)\n│   └── api-guardian/\n│       ├── .claude-plugin/\n│       │   └── plugin.json\n│       ├── agents/               # Subagent definitions (security-auditor, api-reviewer)\n│       ├── commands/             # Slash commands (audit, scan)\n│       └── skills/               # Skills organized by domain (openapi/, security/)\n├── CLAUDE.md                     # Project-level memory and conventions\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## How Plugin Marketplaces Work\n\nA marketplace is a Git repository with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at its root. This manifest declares the marketplace name, owner, and lists all available plugins with their relative source paths.\n\nHere is the manifest from this demo:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"demo-marketplace\",\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"name\": \"Demo Author\",\n    \"email\": \"demo@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"plugins\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"data-toolkit\",\n      \"source\": \"./claude-plugins/data-toolkit\",\n      \"description\": \"Adds data engineering agents, commands, and skills for ETL pipeline development.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"api-guardian\",\n      \"source\": \"./claude-plugins/api-guardian\",\n      \"description\": \"Adds API security auditing agents, commands, and skills for governance and OWASP compliance.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsers add the marketplace and install plugins like this:\n\n```shell\n# Add this marketplace (from a Git repo URL or local path)\n/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/demo-claude-marketplace\n\n# Install a specific plugin\n/plugin install data-toolkit@demo-marketplace\n```\n\nFor private repositories, Claude Code uses your existing git credential helpers. If `git clone` works in your terminal, it works in Claude Code.\n\n## What Plugins Provide\n\nEach plugin is a directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at its root, plus any combination of these components:\n\n| Component | Location | Purpose |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| **Agents** | `agents/*.md` | Specialized subagents with custom system prompts, tool access, and permissions. Appear in `/agents`. |\n| **Commands** | `commands/*.md` | Slash commands invokable with `/plugin-name:command`. |\n| **Skills** | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Reusable expertise modules Claude loads automatically based on task context. Can include supporting files. |\n| **MCP Servers** | `.mcp.json` | Model Context Protocol server definitions for external tool integrations. |\n| **Hooks** | `hooks/hooks.json` | Event handlers that fire on lifecycle events (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, etc.). |\n| **LSP Servers** | `.lsp.json` | Language Server Protocol configs for code intelligence. |\n\n> **Note:** MCP server definitions should live within plugins (via `.mcp.json` or inline in `plugin.json`) when the capability is meant to be reusable across projects. This keeps the MCP configuration bundled with the plugin and distributed through the marketplace automatically.\n\n## Included Plugins\n\n### data-toolkit\n\nData engineering capabilities for ETL pipeline development and analytics workflows.\n\n- **Agents:** `data-engineer` and `pipeline-architect` -- specialized subagents for data infrastructure tasks\n- **Commands:** `/data-toolkit:ingest` and `/data-toolkit:transform` -- slash commands for data operations\n- **Skills:** `sql/` and `etl/` -- domain expertise Claude applies automatically when working on data tasks\n\n### api-guardian\n\nAPI security and governance tooling for auditing, validation, and standards enforcement.\n\n- **Agents:** `security-auditor` and `api-reviewer` -- subagents for security analysis and API design review\n- **Commands:** `/api-guardian:audit` and `/api-guardian:scan` -- slash commands for security operations\n- **Skills:** `openapi/` and `security/` -- domain expertise for OpenAPI validation and OWASP compliance\n\n## Plugins vs. Project Configuration\n\nClaude Code has two layers that work together. Understanding which concerns belong where is key to a clean setup.\n\n### Plugins handle reusable capabilities\n\nPlugins package agents, commands, skills, MCP servers, and hooks that are **shared across projects and teams**. They are versioned, distributed through marketplaces, and namespaced to avoid conflicts. Use plugins when the functionality is not specific to a single codebase.\n\n### Project config handles domain context\n\nProject-level configuration handles concerns **specific to this codebase**:\n\n- **`CLAUDE.md`** -- project memory: architecture decisions, coding conventions, team guidelines. Claude loads this at the start of every session.\n- **`.claude/settings.json`** -- permission rules, environment variables, hooks scoped to this project. This file is committed to git and shared with the team.\n- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** -- personal overrides that stay on your machine (gitignored).\n- **Hooks** -- lifecycle automation (format on save, block protected files, notifications) that enforces project-specific rules.\n\nThe split is straightforward: plugins are for reusable capabilities you distribute, project config is for the domain context and conventions that make this specific codebase work. A plugin might provide a `security-auditor` agent, while your `CLAUDE.md` explains your project's specific authentication architecture so that agent has the right context.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (`claude --version`)\n- Git access to this repository (or a local clone)\n\n### Test locally\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone <repo-url> demo-claude-marketplace\ncd demo-claude-marketplace\n\n# Launch Claude Code with the marketplace loaded locally\nclaude --plugin-dir ./claude-plugins/data-toolkit --plugin-dir ./claude-plugins/api-guardian\n```\n\n### Use as a marketplace\n\n```bash\n# Add this repo as a marketplace source\n# (within Claude Code)\n/plugin marketplace add ./demo-claude-marketplace\n\n# Install a plugin\n/plugin install data-toolkit@demo-marketplace\n\n# Validate the marketplace structure\nclaude plugin validate .\n```\n\n### Build your own\n\n1. Create your plugin directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n2. Add `agents/`, `commands/`, and `skills/` directories as needed\n3. Define MCP servers in `.mcp.json` if your plugin integrates external tools\n4. Create a marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in a parent repository\n5. Host on GitHub, GitLab, or any git host -- users add it with `/plugin marketplace add`\n\n> **Tip:** Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then convert to a plugin when you are ready to share. The docs cover the migration process in detail.\n\n## References\n\n- [Plugins -- Creating Claude Code plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)\n- [Plugins Reference -- Complete technical specifications](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)\n- [Plugin Marketplaces -- Creating and distributing marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces)\n- [Skills -- Extending Claude with reusable expertise](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)\n- [Subagents -- Custom AI agents for task delegation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)\n- [Hooks -- Lifecycle event automation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide)\n- [MCP -- Connecting Claude Code to external tools](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)\n- [Settings -- Configuration scopes and settings files](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)\n"
