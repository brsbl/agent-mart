        "README.md": "# AI Engineering Skills\n\nA comprehensive skill library teaching professional prompt engineering techniques, patterns, and workflows for AI coding assistants.\n\n## What You Get\n\n- **Four-Phase Workflow** - Systematic approach: Intake, Analysis, Recommendation, Construction\n- **Technique Library** - 10+ research-backed prompting techniques with decision frameworks\n- **Pattern Templates** - Ready-to-customize examples for common scenarios\n- **Expert Guidance** - Conversational consulting to design effective prompts\n- **Reference Materials** - Deep dives on techniques, best practices, and anti-patterns\n\nPlus:\n- **Automatic Activation** - Skill activates when working with prompts or AI systems\n- **Teaching Focus** - Learn methodology, not just get answers\n- **Cost-Aware** - Built-in considerations for token usage and efficiency\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)\n\nIn Claude Code, register the marketplace first:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add benjaminjackson/ai-engineering-skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin from this marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install prompting@ai-engineering-skills\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nCheck that the skill is available:\n\n```bash\n/skills\n```\n\n```\n# Should see:\n# prompt-engineering - Expert guidance for creating and optimizing prompts\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Activating the Skill\n\nThe skill activates automatically when you're working with prompts or ask for prompt engineering help. You can also explicitly invoke it:\n\n```\nHelp me create a prompt for [your use case]\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nI need to optimize this prompt: [paste your prompt]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n**Creating a new prompt:**\n```\nI need a prompt to extract structured data from customer emails\n```\n\n**Optimizing an existing prompt:**\n```\nThis prompt works but uses too many tokens. Can you help optimize it?\n```\n\n**Understanding techniques:**\n```\nWhen should I use chain-of-thought vs tree-of-thought prompting?\n```\n\n## What's Inside\n\n### Skills Library\n\n**`prompt-engineering`** (`prompt-engineering/SKILL.md`)\n- Four-phase workflow for systematic prompt design\n- Conversational consulting approach\n- Guidance on technique selection\n- Collaborative prompt construction with explanations\n- Success measurement framework\n\n### Reference Materials\n\n**`techniques-guide.md`** (`prompt-engineering/references/`)\n- 10+ core prompting techniques:\n  - Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought\n  - Self-consistency, tree-of-thought, generated knowledge\n  - Least-to-most, self-refine, directional-stimulus\n- Quick reference table for technique selection\n- Decision criteria, examples, and common pitfalls\n\n**`best-practices.md`** (`prompt-engineering/references/`)\n- Core principles: clarity, positive guidance, clear separation\n- Role and system message design patterns\n- Context organization strategies\n- Six-step optimization process\n- Common anti-patterns and quality checklist\n\n**`pattern-library.md`** (`prompt-engineering/references/`)\n- Ready-to-use templates for common scenarios\n- Categories: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based\n- Structured output patterns\n- Multi-step workflows\n- Analysis and evaluation templates\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe skill guides you through a structured four-phase workflow:\n\n1. **Intake** - Understanding your actual goal and constraints through clarifying questions\n2. **Analysis** - Assessing task complexity to determine appropriate techniques\n3. **Recommendation** - Selecting specific techniques with clear rationale\n4. **Construction** - Collaboratively building optimized prompts with explanations\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **Ask before solving** - Clarify the real goal before suggesting solutions\n- **Avoid over-engineering** - Use the simplest effective approach for the task\n- **Teach principles** - Help users understand methodology for future prompts\n- **Explain rationale** - Every recommendation includes reasoning\n- **Iterative construction** - Build prompts collaboratively with explanation\n- **Success measurement** - Focus on clarity, effectiveness, efficiency, reusability, and user confidence\n\n## Contributing\n\nSkills live directly in this repository. To contribute:\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a branch for your improvements\n3. Follow existing patterns in `SKILL.md` and reference files\n4. Test your changes thoroughly\n5. Submit a PR\n\nSee the existing skill structure for examples of best practices.\n\n## Updating\n\nSkills update automatically when you update the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin update ai-engineering-skills\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see LICENSE file for details\n\n## Support\n\n- **Issues**: https://github.com/benjaminjackson/ai-engineering-skills/issues\n- **Repository**: https://github.com/benjaminjackson/ai-engineering-skills\n"
