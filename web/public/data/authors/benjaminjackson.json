        "README.md": "# Ruby LSP Plugin for Claude Code\n\nDead-simple Ruby LSP integration for Claude Code with intelligent guidance on LSP usage.\n\n## What This Does\n\nConnects Claude Code to the Ruby LSP server, providing semantic code intelligence through the LSP tool:\n- Go-to-definition (with inheritance & mixins support)\n- Find references across project\n- Hover documentation with signatures\n- Document and workspace symbol navigation\n- Call hierarchy analysis (incoming/outgoing calls)\n- Implementation finding\n\n**Plus:** Automatic SessionStart hook that guides Claude on when and how to use the 9 LSP operations proactively, ensuring optimal use of semantic analysis over text-based searches.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n```bash\ngem install ruby-lsp\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add benjaminjackson/ruby-lsp\n/plugin install ruby-lsp@ruby-lsp-marketplace\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### LSP Server Integration\n\nThe plugin automatically starts the Ruby LSP server when Claude Code launches in a Ruby project. The LSP tool is a first-class tool (like Read, Bash, Edit) that requires three parameters:\n- **filePath**: Absolute path to the Ruby file\n- **line**: Line number (1-indexed)\n- **character**: Character position (1-indexed)\n\n### SessionStart Hook\n\nOn session start, Claude receives comprehensive guidance on:\n- **9 available LSP operations** - goToDefinition, hover, findReferences, documentSymbol, workspaceSymbol, goToImplementation, prepareCallHierarchy, incomingCalls, outgoingCalls\n- **When to use LSP** - For definitions, references, hover docs, call analysis, symbol search\n- **When NOT to use LSP** - Clear guidance on when standard tools (Read, Grep) are better\n- **Best practices** - Optimal workflows combining LSP and standard tools\n\nThis ensures Claude uses semantic analysis when appropriate (finding definitions, understanding call chains) rather than text-based searches (Grep for \"def method_name\").\n\n## Available LSP Operations\n\nThe LSP tool provides 9 operations for Ruby code intelligence:\n\n### 1. goToDefinition\n**Find where a symbol is defined**\n- Supports: Classes, modules, methods (including inherited), singleton methods, instance variables, local variables, super keyword\n- Use case: Navigate to exact definition location\n- Why: Understands Ruby scope, inheritance, and mixins\n\n### 2. hover\n**Get hover information (documentation, type info)**\n- Supports: Methods, constants, instance variables (including inherited), Ruby core classes/methods\n- Use case: View method signatures, parameter info, documentation\n- Why: Provides formatted docs with parameter info\n\n### 3. findReferences\n**Find all references to a symbol**\n- Returns: All locations where symbol is referenced across project\n- Use case: See where methods/classes are used\n- Why: Understands Ruby semantics, not just text matches\n\n### 4. documentSymbol\n**Get all symbols in a document**\n- Returns: Hierarchical symbol tree of classes, modules, methods in file\n- Use case: Understand file structure quickly\n- Why: Provides structured view instantly\n\n### 5. workspaceSymbol\n**Search for symbols across workspace**\n- Returns: Matching symbols from entire workspace\n- Use case: Find classes, modules, methods across project\n- Why: LSP indexes workspace and understands Ruby structure\n\n### 6. goToImplementation\n**Find implementations of an interface or abstract method**\n- Returns: File paths and positions of implementations\n- Use case: Working with abstract methods, find concrete implementations\n- Why: Semantic understanding of Ruby class hierarchies\n\n### 7. prepareCallHierarchy\n**Get call hierarchy item at a position**\n- Returns: Call hierarchy item for the function\n- Use case: Understand call structure of methods\n- Why: Provides context for method call chains\n\n### 8. incomingCalls\n**Find all functions/methods that call the function at a position**\n- Returns: List of callers for the method\n- Use case: See what calls this method (\"who calls me?\")\n- Why: Understand method usage and dependencies\n\n### 9. outgoingCalls\n**Find all functions/methods called by the function at a position**\n- Returns: List of methods called by this method\n- Use case: See what this method calls (\"what do I call?\")\n- Why: Understand method dependencies and flow\n\n## Example Usage\n\n**Finding a method definition:**\n```\nUser: Where is the process_payment method defined?\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"goToDefinition\" instead of Grep]\n        [Supports inherited methods from superclasses and mixins]\n```\n\n**Understanding method signature:**\n```\nUser: What parameters does process_payment accept?\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"hover\" to get signature and docs]\n```\n\n**Finding all uses of a method:**\n```\nUser: Where is process_payment called?\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"findReferences\" across entire project]\n        [Not just text matches - understands Ruby semantics]\n```\n\n**Exploring unfamiliar codebase:**\n```\nUser: Show me all payment-related classes\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"workspaceSymbol\" to search across project]\n        [Uses operation=\"goToDefinition\" to navigate to each]\n        [Uses operation=\"documentSymbol\" to see file structure]\n```\n\n**Analyzing call chains:**\n```\nUser: What calls the validate_payment method?\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"incomingCalls\" to find all callers]\n\nUser: What does validate_payment call?\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"outgoingCalls\" to see dependencies]\n```\n\n**Refactoring safely:**\n```\nUser: I want to refactor this method\nClaude: [Uses LSP operation=\"findReferences\" to find all usages first]\n        [Uses operation=\"incomingCalls\" to see all callers]\n        [Makes changes with Edit]\n        [Uses operation=\"findReferences\" again to verify]\n```\n\n## Key Advantages\n\n- **Semantic understanding** - LSP understands Ruby scope, inheritance, and mixins, not just text patterns\n- **Proactive guidance** - Claude knows when to use LSP vs standard tools automatically\n- **Call analysis** - Understand method dependencies with incomingCalls/outgoingCalls\n- **Project-wide search** - Find references and symbols across entire workspace\n- **First-class tool** - LSP is a built-in tool like Read, Bash, and Edit\n",

Critical for preventing unnecessary file reads when structural information is needed.\n---\n\n# Ruby LSP Usage Guidance\n\nThis project has Ruby LSP (shopify/ruby-lsp) integration enabled. Use the LSP tool proactively for Ruby code intelligence.\n\n## CRITICAL: Check This Decision Tree FIRST\n\n**BEFORE Reading Any Ruby File**, determine what information is needed:\n\n**Need file structure overview?** → **documentSymbol** ✅\n**Need to know what methods exist?** → **documentSymbol** ✅\n**Need method signatures?** → **documentSymbol + Read** ✅ (NOT hover - doesn't work on definitions)\n**Need to understand class/module structure?** → **documentSymbol** ✅\n**Need to see where a method is defined?** → **goToDefinition** ✅ (from call site)\n**Need to see where a method is used?** → **findReferences** ✅ (very detailed)\n**Need quick signature from call site?** → **hover** ✅ (works on calls, not definitions)\n**Need implementation details?** → **Read** ✅\n**Need to search across project?** → **Grep** ✅ (workspaceSymbol doesn't work)\n\n**Key Rule:** documentSymbol for structure, Read for content, LSP for navigation.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| What You Need | Use This | NOT This |\n|---------------|----------|----------|\n| File structure overview | documentSymbol | Read entire file |\n| Method signature | documentSymbol + Read | hover on definition (doesn't work) |\n| Where method is defined | goToDefinition | Grep for \"def method\" |\n| Where method is used | findReferences | Grep for method name |\n| Cross-project search | Grep | workspaceSymbol (broken) |\n| Quick signature from call | hover on call site | Navigate away |\n| Implementation details | Read | documentSymbol (only gives structure) |\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n### Getting Method Signatures (The Right Way)\n\nCRITICAL: Ruby LSP cannot extract signatures from method definitions.\n\n❌ **BROKEN - Hover on definitions (this will never work):**\n```\nStep 1: documentSymbol → get \"initialize\" at line 41\nStep 2: hover at line 41 → Returns \"No hover information available\"\nWhy: Hover does NOT support Prism::DefNode (method definitions)\n```\n\n✅ **CORRECT - documentSymbol + Read:**\n```\nStep 1: documentSymbol on file.rb → get method list:\n  - process_payment at line 145\n  - validate_card at line 167\n  - charge_card at line 189\n\nStep 2: Read file.rb offset=144 limit=5 → see actual def:\n  def process_payment(amount, currency = 'USD', metadata = {})\n    validate_card(metadata[:card])\n    charge_card(amount, currency)\n  end\n\nResult: Full signature without reading entire file\n```\n\n✅ **ALTERNATIVE - Hover on call site (if you have one):**\n```\nContext: You see `processor.process_payment(100, 'EUR')` at line 89\nStep 1: hover at that call site (on \"process_payment\")\nResult: Shows signature from definition: process_payment(amount, currency = 'USD', metadata = {})\nLimitation: Requires finding a call site first\n```\n\n### Why Hover Doesn't Work on Definitions\n\nRuby LSP's ALLOWED_TARGETS:\n- ✅ Prism::CallNode (method calls)\n- ✅ Prism::ConstantReadNode (constants)\n- ❌ Prism::DefNode (method definitions) ← NOT SUPPORTED\n\nThis is by design. To get signatures from definitions, use documentSymbol + Read.\n\n### Understanding File Structure\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\n```\nTask: Understand what's in this Ruby file\nAssistant: [Reads entire file and manually parses for classes/methods]\n```\n\n✅ **Correct:**\n```\nTask: Understand what's in this Ruby file\nStep 1: documentSymbol → get hierarchical structure\nResult:\n  PaymentProcessor (Class) - Line 10\n    initialize (Constructor) - Line 12\n    process_payment (Method) - Line 145\n    validate_card (Method) - Line 167\n\nStep 2: Read specific methods if needed\n```\n\n### Finding Where Methods Are Called\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\n```\nTask: Find all places where process_payment is called\nAssistant: [Uses Grep to search for \"process_payment\" as text]\n```\n\n✅ **Correct:**\n```\nTask: Find all places where process_payment is called\nStep 1: goToDefinition or documentSymbol → find method at line 145\nStep 2: findReferences at line 145\nResult: Found 12 references:\n  app/controllers/payments_controller.rb:\n    Line 23:15\n    Line 67:11\n  lib/billing/processor.rb:\n    Line 89:27\n  [... detailed, semantic matches]\n```\n\n## Detailed Operation Guide\n\n### 1. documentSymbol - \"What's in this file?\" (PRIMARY TOOL)\n\n**Use when you need:**\n- List of all methods in a file\n- Class and module structure\n- Overview before diving deeper\n- Method names with line numbers\n\n**Returns:**\n- Hierarchical structure of all symbols\n- Method names (NOT full signatures - use Read for that)\n- Line numbers for each symbol\n- Classes, modules, methods, instance variables\n\n**How to use:**\n```\nLSP operation=\"documentSymbol\" filePath=\"/absolute/path/file.rb\" line=1 character=1\n```\n\n**Note:** line/character parameters are required but don't affect results - you always get all symbols.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nContext: User asks \"What methods are available in payment_processor.rb?\"\n\nLSP operation=\"documentSymbol\" filePath=\"/app/payment_processor.rb\" line=1 character=1\n\nReturns:\n  PaymentProcessor (Class) - Line 10\n    initialize (Constructor) - Line 12\n    process_payment (Method) - Line 145\n    validate_card (Method) - Line 167\n    charge_card (Method) - Line 189\n```\n\n**Follow-up:** Use Read with offset/limit to see specific method signatures.\n\n### 2. findReferences - \"Where is this used?\"\n\n**Use when you need:**\n- All places a method is called\n- All uses of a class or constant\n- Impact analysis before refactoring\n\n**Returns:**\n- Every location where symbol is referenced\n- Very detailed output with file paths and line numbers\n- Semantic matches (not string search)\n\n**How to use:**\n```\nContext: Want to find all usages of log method at line 259\nLSP operation=\"findReferences\" filePath=\"/path/file.rb\" line=259 character=7\n\nReturns: Found 48 references across 3 files:\n  lib/journeys/brief_writer.rb:\n    Line 109:11\n    Line 117:7\n  scripts/generate_briefs.rb:\n    Line 143:27\n    Line 153:27\n  [... comprehensive list]\n```\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n```\nContext: About to rename or refactor process_payment method\nStep 1: documentSymbol or goToDefinition → find definition location\nStep 2: findReferences at definition location\nResult: All call sites across project for impact analysis\n```\n\n### 3. goToDefinition - \"Where is this defined?\"\n\n**Use when you need:**\n- Jump to where method/class is defined\n- Find definition of inherited method\n- Navigate from usage to definition\n\n**Returns:**\n- Exact file path and line number of definition\n- Works with inheritance and mixins\n\n**How to use:**\n```\nContext: Line 143 has `log(msg)` call, need to see implementation\nLSP operation=\"goToDefinition\" filePath=\"/path/file.rb\" line=143 character=27\n\nReturns: Defined in scripts/generate_briefs.rb:259:7\n```\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n```\nContext: Looking at code that calls User.authenticate, need to see how it's implemented\nStep 1: goToDefinition on authenticate call site\nResult: Jumps to exact definition, even if in parent class or mixin\n```\n\n**Don't use Grep** to search for \"def method_name\" - goToDefinition understands inheritance.\n\n### 4. hover - \"What does this call/constant do?\" (LIMITED USE)\n\n**CRITICAL:** Hover is a LIMITED tool in Ruby. It works on usage sites, not definitions.\n\n**Works on:**\n- ✅ Method calls: `user.save` → shows signature\n- ✅ Constants: `PaymentProcessor` → shows class definition\n- ✅ Variables: `@user`, `@@class_var`, `$global` → shows where defined\n- ✅ Keywords: `super`, `yield`\n\n**Does NOT work on:**\n- ❌ Method definitions: `def save` → no response\n- ❌ Local variables\n- ❌ Method parameters\n- ❌ Most other Ruby syntax\n\n**When to use:**\nReading code and encounter a method call to something defined in another file. Hover gives you quick signature without navigating away.\n\n**Example - The actual use case:**\n```\nContext: You're reading payment_processor.rb and see:\n  validator.check_amount(amount)\n\nYou want to know check_amount's signature without navigating to validator.rb\n\nLSP operation=\"hover\" filePath=\"/app/payment_processor.rb\" line=24 character=15\n\nReturns:\n  check_amount(amount, options = {})\n  Definition: lib/validators/amount_validator.rb:45\n  Documentation: [if any exists]\n```\n\nThis is useful but narrow - not a primary workflow tool.\n\n**When NOT to use:**\n- Getting signatures from method definitions → Use documentSymbol + Read\n- Primary code exploration → Use documentSymbol\n- Understanding file structure → Use documentSymbol\n\n**Why hover is secondary:**\n- Requires being at a specific call site\n- Doesn't work on definitions (the most common need)\n- documentSymbol + Read is more direct for most use cases\n\n## How to Use LSP Operations\n\nLSP operations don't require line/character precision for most use cases:\n\n**documentSymbol:**\n- Call it on any Ruby file\n- Returns all symbols with line numbers\n- line/character parameters required but don't affect results\n- Always returns complete symbol tree\n\n**goToDefinition:**\n- Use from a call site or reference\n- Navigate to where symbol is defined\n- Works semantically (understands inheritance)\n\n**findReferences:**\n- Use from a definition\n- Get all usages across entire project\n- Returns very detailed output\n\n**hover:**\n- Use when at a method call or constant reference\n- Works on the usage site, not the definition\n- Limited use cases - prefer documentSymbol + Read for getting signatures\n\n## Available LSP Operations\n\nRuby LSP in Claude Code has 4 useful operations:\n\n### 1. documentSymbol (PRIMARY - Always Reliable)\n**Get all symbols in a document**\n- Use when: Need to understand file structure (classes, modules, methods)\n- Returns: Hierarchical symbol tree with line numbers\n- Why use: Always works, provides structured view instantly\n- ❌ Don't use Read + manual parsing for structure\n\n### 2. findReferences (Extremely Useful)\n**Find all references to a symbol**\n- Use when: Need to see where methods/classes are used across project\n- Returns: All locations where symbol is referenced (very detailed)\n- Why use: Understands Ruby semantics, not just text matches\n- ❌ Don't use Grep to search for method name strings\n\n### 3. goToDefinition (Navigation)\n**Find where a symbol is defined**\n- Use when: Need to find where classes, modules, methods are defined\n- Supports: Works with inheritance and mixins\n- Why use: Understands Ruby scope, provides exact locations\n- ❌ Don't use Grep to search for \"def method_name\"\n\n### 4. hover (SECONDARY - Limited Use Cases)\n**Get information from call sites and constants**\n- Use when: Looking at a method call or constant reference and need quick info\n- Works on: Method CALLS (not definitions), constants, variables\n- Does NOT work on: Method definitions, local variables, most syntax\n- Why limited: Only works on specific node types (CallNode, ConstantReadNode)\n- ❌ Don't use for method signatures from definitions (use documentSymbol + Read)\n\n## When to Use LSP (ALWAYS PREFER LSP)\n\n**Use LSP operations proactively when:**\n\n1. **Understanding file structure** → Use `documentSymbol`\n2. **Finding method/class definitions** → Use `goToDefinition`\n3. **Finding where a method/class is used** → Use `findReferences`\n4. **Getting quick info from call sites** → Use `hover` (limited)\n\n## When NOT to Use LSP (Use Standard Tools)\n\n**Use standard tools when:**\n\n1. **Reading full file contents** → Use Read (LSP only returns symbol info)\n2. **Searching across multiple files for text patterns** → Use Grep (not symbol-specific)\n3. **Editing or writing files** → Use Edit or Write (LSP is read-only)\n4. **Non-Ruby files** → Use standard tools (LSP only works with .rb files)\n5. **Finding string literals or comments** → Use Grep (text search, not semantic)\n6. **Understanding project structure (directories, file organization)** → Use Glob, Bash\n7. **Getting method signatures from definitions** → Use documentSymbol + Read (hover doesn't work on defs)\n\n## Example Workflows\n\n### Task: Understand and modify a Ruby method\n\n1. ✅ documentSymbol - Get file structure with line numbers\n2. ✅ Read relevant lines - See method definitions and signatures\n3. ✅ findReferences - See where method is used (impact analysis)\n4. ✅ goToDefinition - Navigate to related methods if needed\n5. ✅ Edit - Make changes\n6. ✅ findReferences again - Verify all call sites are still valid\n\n### Task: Navigate unfamiliar Ruby codebase\n\n1. ✅ documentSymbol - Get structure of current file\n2. ✅ goToDefinition - Jump from calls to definitions\n3. ✅ findReferences - See how symbols are used\n4. ✅ Read - Examine implementation details when needed\n\n### Task: Refactor a method safely\n\n1. ✅ documentSymbol - Find method in current file\n2. ✅ findReferences - Find all usages before changing (detailed output)\n3. ✅ Read - Review implementation\n4. ✅ Edit - Make refactoring changes\n5. ✅ findReferences - Verify all call sites are updated\n\n### Task: Quick lookup while reading code\n\n1. ✅ Reading file, encounter `validator.check_amount(amount)`\n2. ✅ hover on check_amount - Get signature without navigating\n3. Continue reading with context\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with documentSymbol** - Always get the structure first\n2. **Use Read for signatures** - Don't try to hover on definitions\n3. **Use hover sparingly** - Only when at call sites needing quick lookup\n4. **Navigate with goToDefinition** - Not Grep searches\n5. **Verify with findReferences** - Before and after refactoring (very detailed)\n6. **Combine tools** - documentSymbol + Read + findReferences is the core workflow\n7. **Fall back gracefully** - If LSP calls fail, use standard tools (Read, Grep)\n\nProactively use these 4 LSP operations throughout your Ruby development workflow for semantic code intelligence.\n"
