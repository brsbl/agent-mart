        "consulting-toolkit/README.md": "# Consulting Toolkit\n\nA multi-agent consulting system for Claude Code that replicates the structure and quality standards of a top-tier strategy consulting engagement.\n\n## What It Does\n\nAn **Engagement Manager** agent (opus) orchestrates four specialist sub-agents (all opus) to decompose complex strategic briefs into workstreams, delegate to specialists, enforce quality gates, and synthesize deliverables. For quick-turn tasks, 15 slash commands provide direct access to consulting methodologies.\n\n## Components\n\n### Agents (5)\n\n| Agent | Model | Role |\n|-------|-------|------|\n| `engagement-manager` | opus | Orchestrator, quality gate, client proxy |\n| `research-analyst` | opus | Market research, competitive intelligence, company profiling |\n| `financial-modeler` | opus | Financial models, business cases, NPV/ROI, sensitivity analysis |\n| `deck-builder` | opus | Presentation storylines, pyramid principle, slide decks |\n| `due-diligence` | opus | Target screening, risk assessment, DD checklists |\n\n### Slash Commands (15)\n\n**Research**\n- `/market-size` — Structured market sizing (top-down + bottom-up)\n- `/competitive-landscape` — Competitive landscape mapping\n- `/company-profile` — One-page company profile from public sources\n\n**Structured Thinking**\n- `/issue-tree` — MECE issue tree decomposition\n- `/hypothesis` — Hypothesis generation and testing plan\n- `/so-what` — Extract strategic implications from analysis\n- `/size-the-prize` — Financial impact sizing\n\n**Deliverables**\n- `/storyline` — Pyramid-principle slide storyline\n- `/exec-summary` — SCR executive summary\n- `/steerco-update` — Steering committee status update\n\n**Engagement Management**\n- `/workplan` — Structured workplan with workstreams and timeline\n- `/business-case` — Full business case scaffold\n- `/raci` — RACI matrix generation\n- `/risk-log` — Risk and issue log\n- `/benchmark` — Benchmarking analysis\n\n### Skills (1)\n\n- **consulting-frameworks** — Core consulting thinking frameworks (MECE, Pyramid Principle, SCR, Porter's Five Forces, TAM/SAM/SOM, and more)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/zAI-Skills\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install consulting-toolkit@zAI-Skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Quick Tasks (Slash Commands)\n```\n/issue-tree Should we build or buy our data platform?\n/exec-summary Q3 earnings performance and strategic outlook\n/market-size European electric vehicle charging infrastructure\n```\n\n### Complex Engagements (Engagement Manager)\nFor multi-workstream briefs, the Engagement Manager automatically activates:\n\n> Evaluate whether FedEx should acquire a cold chain logistics company in Europe.
