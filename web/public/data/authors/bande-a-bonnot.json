        "README.md": "# compounded-engineering\n\nEnd-to-end development pipeline for Claude Code. One command from idea to merged PR.\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\nbrainstorm → plan → deepen → review → implement → PR → compound\n|________ interactive ________|  |_______ autonomous _______|\n```\n\n## Components\n\n| Component | Count |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Commands  | 1     |\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/workflows:pipeline` | Full development lifecycle orchestrator |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [compound-engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) plugin (required)\n- [ralph-loop](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) plugin (optional)\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```\nclaude plugin install compound-engineering\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace:\n\n    /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Bande-a-Bonnot/compounded-engineering\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\n    /plugin install compounded-engineering\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the full pipeline:\n\n```\n/workflows:pipeline\n```\n\nSeed with a feature idea:\n\n```\n/workflows:pipeline \"add rate limiting to the API\"\n```\n\n### What Happens\n\nPhase 1 (interactive):\n1. Brainstorm -- explore the idea with you\n2. Plan -- generate an implementation plan\n3. Deepen -- enrich with parallel research\n4. Review -- multi-agent plan review; approve or reject\n\nPhase 2 (autonomous):\n\n5. Implement -- fresh Task agent per milestone\n6. Open PR, request reviews (Codex, Gemini)\n7. Address feedback, monitor CI\n8. Compound learnings to branch\n\nPhase 3:\n\n9. Report PR URL(s). You merge.\n\nFor milestone plans, one agent per milestone. Pipeline waits for\nyour merge between each.\n\n### Interaction Points\n\n| Step | Interactive? | Condition |\n|------|-------------|-----------|\n| Brainstorm | Yes (1-5 questions) | Always |\n| Plan | Yes (0-3 questions) | If ambiguity exists |\n| Deepen/Review | No | Autonomous |\n| Apply suggestions | Yes (1 question) | Always |\n| Implement | No | Autonomous per milestone |\n| Merge approval | Yes (1 per milestone) | Multi-milestone plans only |\n\n## For Agent Callers\n\nIndividual phases are available via compound-engineering:\n- `/compound-engineering:workflows:brainstorm`\n- `/compound-engineering:workflows:plan`\n- `/compound-engineering:workflows:work`\n- `/compound-engineering:workflows:review`\n- `/compound-engineering:workflows:compound`\n\nUse the pipeline for end-to-end. Use individual commands for targeted work.\n\n## Customization\n\nFork and edit `commands/workflows/pipeline.md`. Common changes:\n\n- Remove review bot comments (lines with @codex, /gemini)\n- Remove ralph-loop steps (steps 1 and 10)\n- Add your own review commands\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
