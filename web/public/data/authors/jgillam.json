        "README.md": "# Practical Claude Code\n\nA curated marketplace of Claude Code plugins, workflows, and configurations to enhance your AI-assisted development experience.\n\n## About\n\nThis marketplace provides a collection of reusable Claude Code plugins organized by functional area. Each plugin is self-contained with its own commands, documentation, and installation instructions.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nRegister this marketplace in Claude Code to make all plugins available. See the [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) for details on registering marketplaces.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### Session Management\n\n**[jg-session](plugins/jg-session/)** - Maintain context and continuity between Claude Code sessions\n\nA pair of slash commands (`/tidyup` and `/tidydown`) that automate end-of-session cleanup and start-of-session context loading. Creates structured session summaries so you never have to re-explain your work when you return.\n\n- **Commands**: `tidyup`, `tidydown`\n- **Version**: 1.0.0\n- **Category**: Workflow & Productivity\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\nEach plugin in this marketplace follows a consistent structure:\n\n```\nplugins/\n└── plugin-name/\n    ├── .claude-plugin/\n    │   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata\n    ├── commands/\n    │   ├── command1.md           # Command definitions\n    │   └── command2.md\n    └── README.md                 # Plugin documentation\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nRegister this marketplace in Claude Code to install plugins. Once registered, all plugins become available directly within Claude Code.\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, see the [Claude Code Plugin Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).\n\n## Categories\n\nPlugins are organized into categories for easy discovery:\n\n- **Workflow & Productivity**: Tools to enhance development workflows\n- **Context Management**: Tools for managing and preserving development context\n\n## Plugin Development\n\n### Creating a Plugin\n\nWant to contribute your own plugin? Follow this structure:\n\n1. Create a directory under `plugins/` with a descriptive name (consider using a namespace prefix like `yourname-pluginname`)\n2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with metadata\n3. Create `commands/` directory with command definition files (`.md`)\n4. Write a comprehensive `README.md`\n5. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to register your plugin\n\n### Plugin Naming Convention\n\nUse a namespace prefix to avoid conflicts:\n- `jg-session` (Jason G.'s session management plugin)\n- `yourname-yourplugin` (your plugin)\n\nThis is similar to scoped packages in npm (`@username/package`) or Java package namespacing (`com.company.product`).\n\n### Plugin Metadata\n\nSee existing plugins for examples of `plugin.json` structure. Key fields:\n- **id**: Unique identifier (must match directory name)\n- **name**: Display name\n- **version**: Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)\n- **commands**: Array of command definitions with metadata\n- **keywords**: For searchability\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! This marketplace grows organically as the community develops new tools and workflows.\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n1. Fork this repository\n2. Create a new plugin following the structure above\n3. Test your commands thoroughly\n4. Submit a pull request with:\n   - Your plugin directory\n   - Updated marketplace.json\n   - Clear documentation\n\n### Contribution Guidelines\n\n- **Self-contained**: Each plugin should be independent\n- **Well-documented**: Include comprehensive README and examples\n- **Tested**: Verify commands work as expected\n- **Namespaced**: Use a personal namespace prefix\n- **Licensed**: Compatible with CC BY 4.0\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)\n- [Custom Slash Commands Guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands)\n- [Marketplace Metadata Reference](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)\n\n## License\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-image]][cc-by]\n\n[cc-by]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n[cc-by-image]: https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\n\nIndividual plugins may have additional attribution requirements.

        "plugins/jg-session/README.md": "# Session Management Plugin (jg-session)\n\nA pair of slash commands that maintain context between Claude Code sessions through automatic session documentation.\n\n## Overview\n\nThese commands work together to create seamless continuity in your development workflow:\n\n- **tidyup** runs at the end of a session to commit your work and create a structured session summary\n- **tidydown** runs at the start of the next session to load the previous context\n\nThis eliminates the need to manually explain what you were working on when starting a new session.\n\n## Commands\n\n### /tidyup\n\nEnd-of-session cleanup that:\n- Ensures `.CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md` is in `.gitignore`\n- Updates project status documentation\n- Commits your code\n- Creates a new session summary with:\n  - What was accomplished (features, bugs fixed, refactoring)\n  - Current state (what's working, what's incomplete)\n  - Next steps (prioritized actions)\n  - Open questions/decisions (blockers, unresolved issues)\n\n### /tidydown\n\nStart-of-session context loader that:\n- Reads `.CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md` from your project root\n- Uses it as context for the current session\n- Informs you if no previous session exists (starting fresh)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is installed by registering the practical-cc marketplace in Claude Code. Once registered, the tidyup and tidydown commands become available automatically.\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, see the [Claude Code Plugin Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Typical Workflow\n\n**End of session:**\n```\n/tidyup\n```\n\n**Start of next session:**\n```\n/tidydown\n```\n\nThen continue with your work. Claude will have full context of what you were doing.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nUser: /tidyup\nClaude: I've completed the session tidy-up:\n1. Verified .CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md is in .gitignore\n2. Committed changes: \"Implement user authentication feature\"\n3. Created session summary with accomplishments and next steps\n\nThe session summary has been saved to .CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md\nUse /tidydown in your next session to load this context.\n\n[Next session]\nUser: /tidydown\nClaude: I've loaded the session context. I can see we implemented user authentication\nand were planning to add password reset functionality next. How would you like to proceed?\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Session Summary Structure\n\nThe tidyup command creates a markdown file (`.CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md`) with:\n\n- **Session Summary**: Date and high-level overview\n- **What was accomplished**: Features, fixes, refactoring performed\n- **Current state**: What's working, incomplete work, known issues\n- **Next steps**: Prioritized list of upcoming work\n- **Open questions**: Blockers, decisions needed, questions for you\n\n### Git Integration\n\nThe tidyup command integrates with your git workflow:\n- Automatically commits changes before creating the session summary\n- Ensures the session file is gitignored (not committed to the repository)\n- Maintains clean commit history\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use tidyup before long breaks**: Before stepping away for more than an hour or ending your day\n2. **Always tidydown when returning**: Start each session with /tidydown to load context\n3. **Review the summary**: After tidyup, review the .CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md to ensure accuracy\n4. **Update CLAUDE.md**: tidyup will update project-level documentation when appropriate\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Issue**: `/tidyup` or `/tidydown` not recognized\n\n**Solution**: Ensure the practical-cc marketplace is registered in Claude Code and the plugin is enabled\n\n**Issue**: Session summary not found\n\n**Solution**: You may not have run `/tidyup` in the previous session. This is normal for new projects.\n\n**Issue**: Git commit fails during tidyup\n\n**Solution**: Ensure you have changes to commit and proper git configuration (user.name, user.email)\n\n## Version History\n\n### 1.0.0\n- Initial release\n- tidyup command for end-of-session cleanup\n- tidydown command for start-of-session context loading\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n## Author\n\nCreated by Jason G. as part of the [practical-cc](https://github.com/jasongilman/practical-cc) marketplace.\n"
