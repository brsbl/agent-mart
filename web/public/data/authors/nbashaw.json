        "README.md": "# Customer Support Skill Builder\n\nA Claude Code skill that helps you build custom customer support automation for your company.\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis is a meta-skill that guides you through creating your own customer support automation system. Instead of manually handling tickets, you'll have an AI assistant that can:\n\n- **Automatically triage** all open support tickets by urgency\n- **Gather customer context** from multiple platforms (support, billing, database)\n- **Draft responses** using templates tailored to your scenarios\n- **Execute common operations** (refunds, cancellations, etc.) via scripts\n- **Suggest the most important ticket** to handle first (just say \"yes\" to start)\n\n## How it works\n\nThe skill walks you through:\n\n1. **Discovery** - Understanding your support stack (Zendesk? Stripe? Database?)\n2. **Planning** - Mapping out the scripts you'll need for your platforms\n3. **Building** - Creating TypeScript scripts that interact with your APIs\n4. **Templates** - Generating response templates for common scenarios\n5. **Workflow** - Setting up an automated triage and response workflow\n6. **Testing** - Validating everything works before production use\n\n## What you'll get\n\nBy the end, you'll have:\n\n- ✅ **Working scripts** for your support platform (list tickets, reply, close, etc.)\n- ✅ **Billing operations** (search customers, refunds, cancellations)\n- ✅ **Database queries** (read-only customer lookups)\n- ✅ **Response templates** for your common support scenarios\n- ✅ **Automated triage** that suggests the most urgent ticket to handle\n- ✅ **Complete documentation** for your team\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Install from marketplace (Recommended)\n\n1. Add the marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin marketplace add nbashaw/claude-cs\n   ```\n\n2. Install the skill:\n   ```bash\n   claude plugin install customer-support-builder\n   ```\n\n3. Use it in any repository:\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/your/company/repo\n   claude\n   /customer-support-builder\n   ```\n\n### Option 2: Manual installation\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/.claude/skills\n   git clone https://github.com/nbashaw/claude-cs\n   ```\n\n2. Invoke the skill in Claude Code:\n   ```bash\n   /customer-support-builder\n   ```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, you'll need:\n\n- Claude Code CLI installed and configured\n- API credentials for your support/billing platforms\n- Access to your company's git repository\n- (Optional) Database access for customer lookups\n\n## Example: What you'll create\n\nHere's what a typical support automation looks like:\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\nsupport-automation/\n├── config.ts                           # Environment loading\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── check-setup.ts                 # Validate setup\n│   ├── list-open-tickets.ts          # Fetch all tickets\n│   ├── get-ticket.ts                  # Get ticket details\n│   ├── reply-to-ticket.ts            # Send responses\n│   ├── close-ticket.ts               # Close tickets\n│   ├── get-customer-context.ts       # Unified customer view\n│   ├── search-billing.ts             # Look up billing info\n│   ├── issue-refund.ts               # Process refunds\n│   └── cancel-subscription.ts        # Cancel subscriptions\n└── references/\n    └── common-responses/\n        ├── refund-approved.md\n        ├── bug-report.md\n        ├── feature-request.md\n        └── ...\n```\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Invoke your support skill\n/support\n\n# Claude automatically:\n# 1. Lists ALL open tickets (with pagination)\n# 2. Triages by urgency (🚨 Critical, ⚠️ High, 📋 Medium, 📧 Low)\n# 3. Suggests: \"The most urgent ticket is #12345 (customer charged twice).\n#    Should I start with this one?\"\n\n# You say: \"yes\"\n\n# 4. Fetches full ticket details\n# 5. Gathers customer context (billing status, subscription, history)\n# 6. Drafts a response using your templates\n# 7. Shows you the draft and asks for approval\n# 8. Sends the reply after you approve\n# 9. Closes the ticket if resolved\n# 10. Moves to the next urgent ticket\n```\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThis skill can help you integrate with:\n\n### Support/Ticketing\n- Zendesk\n- Intercom\n- HelpScout\n- Freshdesk\n- Front\n- Linear\n- Any platform with an API\n\n### Billing/Payments\n- Stripe\n- Chargebee\n- Paddle\n- Braintree\n- Any payment processor with an API\n\n### Databases\n- PostgreSQL\n- MySQL\n- MongoDB\n- Any SQL database\n\n### Other Tools\n- Analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude)\n- Feature flags (LaunchDarkly)\n- Email services (SendGrid, Postmark)\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nThe Lex support automation was built using this approach:\n\n- **15 scripts** for HelpScout, Stripe, and PostgreSQL\n- **6 response templates** for common scenarios\n- **Automatic triage** with keyword detection\n- **Unified customer context** across all platforms\n- Handles ~80% of support tasks with \"yes/no\" approvals\n\n## Philosophy\n\n### Proactive, not reactive\nThe skill **automatically** lists and triages all tickets. You don't waste time scanning - it tells you what's most important.\n\n### Suggest, don't decide\nThe skill recommends actions but always requires your approval. It's an assistant, not autopilot.\n\n### Context before response\nAlways gathers full customer context (billing, usage, history) before drafting a response.\n\n### Templates as starting points\nProvides response templates but personalizes them based on the specific situation.\n\n### Safety first\n- Requires explicit approval before sending anything\n- Uses read-only database connections\n- Never commits credentials to git\n- Validates setup before use\n\n## Who is this for?\n\n### Perfect for:\n- **Startups** handling 10-100 support tickets/day\n- **Teams** wanting to standardize support responses\n- **Solo founders** doing support while building\n- **Companies** with complex support workflows across multiple platforms\n\n### Not ideal for:\n- Enterprise with dedicated support software (though could still help!)\n- Teams with no API access to their platforms\n- Complete beginners (need basic familiarity with APIs and CLIs)\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: How long does this take?**\nA: 30-60 minutes for a basic setup with core scripts and templates. You can expand over time.\n\n**Q: Do I need to be technical?**\nA: You need API access and ability to run scripts. The skill does the coding for you.\n\n**Q: Can I customize it later?**\nA: Absolutely! Add scripts, templates, and workflow steps as you identify repetitive tasks.\n\n**Q: Will this work with my platform?**\nA: If your platform has an API, yes! The skill adapts to your specific stack.\n\n**Q: Is this safe?**\nA: Yes - it always requires your approval before sending messages or making changes.\n\n**Q: Can my team use this?**\nA: Yes! Once built, anyone on your team with API access can use the automation.\n\n## Examples of automations you can build\n\n- Auto-triage tickets by keywords and customer history\n- One-click refunds with automatic email response\n- Gather full customer context before replying\n- Apply discount codes for billing issues\n- Query database for troubleshooting\n- Close multiple resolved tickets at once\n- Search billing history across tickets\n- Generate reports on common issues\n\n## Contributing\n\nHave ideas for improving this skill?
