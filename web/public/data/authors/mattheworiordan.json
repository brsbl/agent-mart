Give it a complex task, and it spawns a colony of specialized workers—each with fresh context, each verified by an independent inspector.\n\n> **Like Ralph, but built for real work.** Where Ralph iterates sequentially and checks its own homework, Colony intelligently parallelizes work with independent QA. Human-in-the-loop or fully autonomous. Git-aware. Production-ready.\n\n---\n\n## See It In Action\n\n<img src=\"assets/colony-deploy-animated.gif\" alt=\"Colony deploying tasks\" width=\"700\">\n\n**Smart Mobilization** — Colony analyzes your brief, identifies parallelization opportunities, and prepares tasks for execution:\n\n<img src=\"assets/colony-mobilizing.png\" alt=\"Colony mobilization phase\" width=\"700\">\n\n**Dependency-Aware Deployment** — Tasks deploy in parallel where safe, serialize where necessary:\n\n<img src=\"assets/colony-mobilized.png\" alt=\"Colony execution plan\" width=\"700\">\n\n**Simple Commands** — Everything accessible via `/colony-*` commands:\n\n<img src=\"assets/colony-commands.png\" alt=\"Colony commands\" width=\"700\">\n\n---\n\n## Why Colony Wins\n\n### v1.2.0: Same Speed, Dramatically Better Quality\n\nMeasured on the same task ([Kitty Keyboard Protocol](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/824) implementation), same codebase, same starting point:\n\n| Metric | Ralph | Colony v1.2 | Winner |\n|--------|-------|-------------|--------|\n| **Runtime** | 12m 39s | ~12 min | Tie |\n| **Lint Errors** | 419 | 0 | **Colony** |\n| **Lines of Code** | 537 | 165 | **Colony** (3.3x leaner) |\n| **PR Ready?** | No (needs cleanup) | Yes | **Colony** |\n\n**The real comparison:** Ralph's 12-minute run produces code needing ~1 hour of cleanup.

Colony does it better:\n\n| Aspect | Native Execution | Colony Execution |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| **Parallelization** | Sequential | Intelligent parallel |\n| **Verification** | Self-check | Independent inspector |\n| **Context** | Accumulates (drifts) | Fresh per task |\n| **Recovery** | Start over | Resume from exact task |\n| **Quality** | Variable | 0 lint errors (benchmarked) |\n\n**Use Claude plan mode for thinking. Use Colony for doing.**\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Intelligent Parallelization\nColony doesn't just run things in parallel—it *thinks* about what can safely parallelize:\n\n- **Dependency analysis** — Understands task dependencies and serializes when needed\n- **Resource awareness** — Knows when tasks touch the same files and avoids conflicts\n- **Asks when uncertain** — Won't guess on parallelization safety; asks you instead\n- **Dynamic adjustment** — Change concurrency mid-run: `\"set concurrency to 3\"`\n\n### Two Execution Modes\n\n**Human-in-the-Loop (default)**\n- Checkpoints between phases for review\n- Approve parallelization decisions\n- Intervene on failures before retrying\n\n**Fully Autonomous**\n- Run overnight without interruption\n- Safety limits prevent runaway failures (max retries, failure thresholds)\n- Complete report waiting for you in the morning\n\n```bash\n/colony-deploy              # Interactive mode\n/colony-deploy autonomous   # Autonomous mode\n```\n\n### Git-Aware Workflow\nColony understands your git workflow and integrates seamlessly:\n\n- **Branch strategy** — Creates feature branches or works on current branch\n- **Smart commits** — After each task, phase, or at project end (you choose)\n- **Conventional commits** — Proper commit messages with Co-Authored-By attribution\n- **Conflict prevention** — Won't parallelize tasks that touch the same files\n\n### Independent Verification\nEvery task completion is verified by a separate inspector agent:\n\n- **Fresh context** — Inspector has no knowledge of worker's struggles or workarounds\n- **Acceptance criteria** — Checks every criterion, not just \"does it compile\"\n- **Visual verification** — `VISUAL:` criteria trigger screenshot capture and validation\n- **No self-deception** — Worker can't mark itself complete; inspector decides\n\n### Full Recovery\nInterrupted? Pick up exactly where you left off:\n\n- **Structured state** — All progress saved to `state.json`\n- **Task-level granularity** — Resume from the exact task that was interrupted\n- **Execution logs** — Every task has detailed logs of what happened\n- **Artifact validation** — Screenshots and logs must exist before marking complete\n\n---\n\n## The Problem With AI Coding Today\n\nWhen tackling large, multi-step coding tasks, AI assistants struggle with:\n\n- **Context drift** — forgetting requirements after many interactions\n- **Verification gaps** — claiming completion without proper testing\n- **Sequential bottlenecks** — not leveraging concurrent execution\n- **Lost progress** — no recovery when interrupted\n- **Invisible work** — no summary of what was done\n\n**Colony solves all of this.** Specialized worker agents execute tasks in parallel. Independent inspector agents verify every completion. Everything logged, everything recoverable.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Install from Marketplace (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, add the Colony marketplace and install\n/plugin marketplace add mattheworiordan/colony\n/plugin install colony\n```\n\n### Option 2: Manual Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/mattheworiordan/colony.git ~/.claude/plugins/colony\n```\n\nAfter cloning, the plugin is automatically available. Restart Claude Code if it's already running.\n\n### Option 3: Project-Local Installation\n\nTo use Colony in a specific project only:\n\n```bash\n# Clone into your project\ngit clone https://github.com/mattheworiordan/colony.git .claude-plugins/colony\n\n# Run Claude Code with the plugin directory\nclaude --plugin-dir .claude-plugins/colony\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, run `/help` in Claude Code — you should see the `/colony-*` commands listed.\n\n**CLI Tool**\n\nColony includes a CLI tool (`bin/colony`) for state management. The plugin commands reference it via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/colony`, so no PATH setup is needed - it works automatically.\n\nFor manual CLI usage outside of Claude Code, you can optionally add it to your PATH or create a symlink.\n\n**Community Registry**: Colony is also indexed at [claude-plugins.dev](https://claude-plugins.dev/), which automatically discovers Claude Code plugins on GitHub.\n\n### Working Directory Convention\n\nColony stores all project state in a `.working/colony/` directory within your project. This includes task files, execution logs, screenshots, and reports.\n\n**Recommendation**: Add `.working/` to your global gitignore to avoid committing Colony's working files:\n\n```bash\n# Add to your global gitignore\necho \".working/\" >> ~/.gitignore_global\ngit config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global\n```\n\nAlternatively, add `.working/` to your project's `.gitignore` if you prefer per-project configuration.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Recommended: Start with Claude Plan Mode\n\nFor complex features, let Claude help you think through requirements first:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Use Claude's plan mode to define requirements\nclaude --permission-mode plan\n> I need to add OAuth2 authentication. Interview me about requirements.\n\n# 2. Claude creates a plan in ~/.claude/plans/\n# 3. Mobilize Colony with that plan\n/colony-mobilize\n\n# 4. Colony auto-detects the recent plan, or specify:\n/colony-mobilize ~/.claude/plans/gleaming-sniffing-bird.md\n\n# 5. Deploy\n/colony-deploy\n```\n\n### Option 1: Create a Brief File\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create a brief describing what you want to accomplish\ncat > .working/MY_FEATURE_BRIEF.md << 'EOF'\n# Add User Authentication\n\n## Goal\nAdd login/logout functionality with session management.\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Login form with email/password\n- [ ] Session storage in localStorage\n- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login\n- [ ] Logout clears session\nEOF\n\n# 2. Plan the tasks\n/colony-mobilize .working/MY_FEATURE_BRIEF.md\n\n# 3. Review the decomposition, then run\n/colony-deploy\n```\n\n### Option 2: Point to Any File\n\nYou can use any markdown file as a brief — it doesn't need to be in `.working/`:\n\n```bash\n# Use a file from docs/\n/colony-mobilize docs/FEATURE_SPEC.md\n\n# Use a file from anywhere\n/colony-mobilize ~/Desktop/my-project-plan.md\n```\n\n### Option 3: Describe Inline\n\nIf you don't have a brief file, just run `/colony-mobilize` and describe what you want:\n\n```bash\n/colony-mobilize\n# Colony will ask: \"I didn't find any brief files. You can:\n#   1. Tell me the path to your brief\n#   2. Paste the tasks directly here\n#   3. Describe what you want to accomplish\"\n```\n\n### Option 4: Quick Tasks\n\nFor simple, well-defined tasks, skip the planning phase entirely:\n\n```bash\n/colony-quick \"Add a loading spinner to the submit button\"\n```\n\n## Brief Discovery\n\nWhen you run `/colony-mobilize` without specifying a file, Colony searches for potential briefs in:\n\n1. **`~/.claude/plans/*.md`** - Recent Claude plans (last 48 hours), ranked by relevance to current project\n2. **`.working/*.md`** - The conventional location for working documents\n3. **`docs/*.md`** - Documentation folder\n4. **Root `.md` files** - Excluding README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE\n\nIf multiple candidates are found, Colony shows them ranked by relevance and asks which to use. If none are found, you can provide a path or describe your requirements directly.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/colony-mobilize [brief]` | Prepare tasks from a brief or Claude plan |\n| `/colony-deploy [project]` | Deploy workers with verification |\n| `/colony-deploy autonomous` | Deploy without human checkpoints |\n| `/colony-status [project]` | Show detailed project status |\n| `/colony-projects` | List all colony projects |\n| `/colony-quick \"prompt\"` | Quick execution for simple tasks |\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Mobilization Phase (`/colony-mobilize`)\n\n- Finds a brief file or Claude plan (auto-detects recent plans)\n- Analyzes the codebase for parallelization opportunities\n- Decomposes work into executable tasks\n- Identifies shared patterns to prevent duplication (DRY)\n- Detects project standards (linter, CLAUDE.md, etc.)\n- Sets up Git strategy (branch, commit frequency)\n\n### 2. Deployment Phase (`/colony-deploy`)\n\n- Spawns isolated **worker** agents for each task\n- Runs tasks in parallel where safe\n- Independent **inspector** agents verify each completion\n- Automatic retry on failure (up to 3 attempts)\n- Git commits at phase boundaries\n- Comprehensive report generation\n\n### 3. Key Features\n\n**Context Isolation**: Each worker runs in a fresh context with only the information it needs. No context drift from accumulated conversation history.\n\n**Independent Verification**: A separate inspector agent checks every \"DONE\" claim. Catches workarounds, missing criteria, and design intent violations.\n\n**Smart Parallelization**: Analyzes dependencies and resource constraints. Asks when uncertain. Serializes browser tests, database migrations, etc.\n\n**Artifact Validation**: Log files and screenshots must exist before marking complete. Never trusts agent claims without filesystem proof.\n\n**Recovery**: All state persisted to JSON. Pick up exactly where you left off if interrupted.\n\n**Autonomous Mode**: Run overnight without checkpoints. Safety limits prevent runaway failures.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nWhen you run `/colony-mobilize`, it creates:\n\n```\n.working/colony/{project-name}/\n├── context.md              # Project rules, tech stack, parallelization\n├── state.json              # Task status, Git config, execution log\n├── tasks/\n│   ├── T001.md            # Individual task files\n│   ├── T002.md\n│   └── ...\n├── logs/\n│   ├── T001_LOG.md        # Execution + verification logs\n│   └── ...\n├── screenshots/            # Visual verification evidence\n├── resources/\n│   └── original-brief.md  # Copy of source brief\n└── REPORT.md              # Final execution report\n```\n\n## Colony vs Ralph\n\n[Ralph](https://www.cursor.com/blog/ralf) popularized autonomous AI coding with a clever while-loop approach. Colony takes it further.\n\n### The Key Insight\n\n**Ralph's weakness**: It checks its own homework. The same model that claims \"done\" also decides if it's really done. That's like asking a student to grade their own test.\n\n**Colony's answer**: Independent verification. A separate inspector agent—with fresh context and no ego investment—verifies every completion. It catches workarounds, missing criteria, and \"works on my machine\" claims.\n\n### Head-to-Head (v1.2.0 Benchmarks)\n\nBoth approaches ran the same task: implement [Kitty Keyboard Protocol](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/824) for the [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) React CLI framework.\n\n| Metric | Colony | Ralph |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| **Runtime** | ~12 min | 12m 39s |\n| **Lint Errors** | **0** | 419 |\n| **Lines of Code** | **165** | 537 |\n| **Time to Merge** | **12 min** | ~72 min (with cleanup) |\n\n> See [`benchmarks/v1.2-results.md`](./benchmarks/v1.2-results.md) for detailed methodology and quality scoring.\n\n### Feature Comparison\n\n| Capability | Colony | Ralph |\n|------------|--------|------|\n| **Parallelization** | Intelligent—analyzes dependencies, asks when uncertain | Single-threaded |\n| **Execution modes** | Human-in-the-loop or fully autonomous | Single mode |\n| **Verification** | Independent inspector agent | Self-check (same model) |\n| **Code Quality** | Linter integrated, 0 errors | No lint check, 419 errors |\n| **Context** | Fresh per-task | Full reset each iteration |\n| **Git workflow** | Branch strategy, smart commits, conflict prevention | Manual |\n| **Visual testing** | Built-in screenshot verification | Manual |\n| **Recovery** | Precise task-level resume | Coarse progress file |\n| **Audit trail** | Complete execution logs per task | Progress notes |\n\n### When to Use Each\n\n**Choose Colony when:**\n- You need production-ready code (0 lint errors)\n- Work can be parallelized (most real projects)\n- You need proof that tasks are actually complete\n- Multiple people need to understand what happened\n- You're building code that goes straight to PR\n\n**Choose Ralph when:**\n- Tasks are strictly sequential\n- You want zero setup (just a prompt pattern)\n- You're exploring/prototyping (quality doesn't matter yet)\n- You have time for manual cleanup afterward\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nRalph proved autonomous AI coding works. Colony makes it production-ready.\n\n**Speed**: Same execution time (~12 min).\n**Quality**: 0 lint errors vs 419. 3.3x less code for same feature.\n**Trust**: Independent verification catches what self-assessment misses.\n**Time to merge**: Colony code is PR-ready. Ralph code needs cleanup.\n\n> 🧪 **Try it yourself**: The [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/) folder contains everything you need to reproduce this comparison.\n\n## Configuration\n\nColony can be configured via `~/.colony/config.json`. This file is created automatically on first run with sensible defaults.\n\n### Config File\n\n```json\n{\n  \"working_dir\": \".working\",\n  \"models\": {\n    \"orchestrator\": \"default\",\n    \"worker\": \"default\",\n    \"inspector\": \"default\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUse `\"default\"` to follow Colony's recommended settings (may change in future versions).\nUse a specific model name to lock in your preference.\n\n### Model Roles\n\n| Role | What it does | Default | Recommendation |\n|------|--------------|---------|----------------|\n| `orchestrator` | Coordinates tasks, manages state, spawns workers/inspectors | `sonnet` | `sonnet` - must reliably follow complex prompts |\n| `worker` | Implements code, runs tests, creates files | `inherit` | `inherit` - needs full reasoning power |\n| `inspector` | Verifies task completion, checks criteria | `haiku` | `haiku` - verification is simpler |\n\n> **Note:** Haiku was tried for orchestrator in v1.2 but proved too weak to reliably spawn inspectors. Sonnet provides the right balance of speed and capability for orchestration.\n\n### Model Options\n\n- **`inherit`** - Uses your Claude Code session's model (Opus, Sonnet, etc.)\n- **`haiku`** - Fast and cheap, good for mechanical tasks\n- **`sonnet`** - Balanced capability and speed\n- **`opus`** - Maximum capability, slower\n\n### How It Works\n\n**Default behavior** (`orchestrator: haiku`, `worker: inherit`):\n- A Haiku sub-agent coordinates task execution (cheap)\n- Workers use your session model (read from Claude Code settings)\n- `worker: inherit` resolves to your `/model` setting (e.g., Opus)\n\n**How inheritance works:** Before delegating to Haiku, Colony reads your session model from `~/.claude/settings.json` (set via `/model` command). When `worker: inherit`, this resolved model (e.g., \"opus\") is passed explicitly to the Haiku orchestrator, which then spawns workers with that model.\n\n| orchestrator | worker | Behavior |\n|--------------|--------|----------|\n| `inherit` | any | Session runs orchestration directly |\n| `haiku` | `inherit` | Haiku orchestrates, workers use session model (e.g., Opus) |\n| `haiku` | `sonnet` | Haiku orchestrates, workers use Sonnet |\n\n### CLI Tool (Internal)\n\nColony includes a CLI (`bin/colony`) for internal state management. This reduces token usage by replacing JSON file reads/writes with simple shell commands.\n\n**For debugging**, you can also use it manually:\n```bash\ncolony state list            # List projects\ncolony state summary my-proj # View status\n```\n\n### Concurrency\n\n```\n# During execution\n\"set concurrency to 3\"   # Run 3 workers in parallel\n\"set concurrency to 10\"  # Run 10 workers in parallel\n\"serialize\"              # Set concurrency to 1\n```\n\nDefault is 5. Set to any value based on your machine resources and task complexity.\n\n### Git Strategy\n\nConfigured during `/colony-mobilize`:\n- **Branch**: Feature branch or current branch\n- **Commits**: After each task, phase, or at end\n- **Style**: Conventional commits with Co-Authored-By\n\n### Autonomous Mode\n\n```\n/colony-deploy autonomous\n```\n\nSafety limits:\n- Max 3 retries per task\n- Stops if >50% of tasks fail\n- Max iterations = total_tasks × 3\n\n## Task File Format\n\nEach task file (`.working/colony/{project}/tasks/T{NNN}.md`) contains:\n\n```markdown\n# Task T001: Setup Authentication\n\n## Status\npending\n\n## Context & Why\n{Why this task exists, how it fits the broader goal}\n\n## Design Intent\n{Philosophy, user preferences, what to avoid}\n\n## Description\n{What needs to be done}\n\n## Files\n- src/auth/login.js\n- src/auth/session.js\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Login form validates email format\n- [ ] VISUAL: Form shows error state on invalid input\n- [ ] Session persists across page reload\n\n## Completion Promise\nWhen done, output: TASK_COMPLETE: T001\n\n## Verification Command\nnpm test -- --testPathPattern=auth\n\n## Dependencies\nNone\n\n## Parallel Group\nsetup\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"No projects found\"\n\nRun `/colony-mobilize` first to create a project from a brief.\n\n### Task stuck in \"running\"\n\nTasks running >30 minutes reset to \"pending\" on next `/colony-deploy`.\n\n### Verification keeps failing\n\nRead the inspector's feedback in `.working/colony/{project}/logs/{task}_LOG.md`. It includes specific suggestions.\n\n### Browser verification not working\n\nEnsure you have browser automation tools available (Playwright, Puppeteer). Colony will use whatever browser automation is available in your environment.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! Please:\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a feature branch\n3.
