        "README.md": "# Claude Stuff\n\nSee also \n- [eighttrigrams/preferences](https://github.com/eighttrigrams/preferences)\n\n## Claude Code on Mac\n\n### Installation\n\nUse\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n```\n\nas per [docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) and choose your account type (see above).\n\nOr use *Homebrew*.\n\n### Configuration files\n\nThe main config file is under `~/.claude.json`. I believe it is not really meant to be edited by hand.\nRather, it keeps tabs about where your claude working directories are on your system and what your preferences are\nthere, apart from the things you yourself specify in these working dirs.\n\n***Working dirs*** means that when you open `claude` in a dir `/Users/dan/Workspace/a`, its settings get stored independently\nfrom those which get stored for a working dir on the same system, at a different path, say `/Users/dan/Workspace/b`.\n\nTODO talk about\n- projects key in that file\n- more than one way to store configuration about mcp servers\n\n## \"Memory\"\n\nA metaphor, which you see from the scare quotes, I don't like, for whichever reason, although I'm generally a fan of metaphors.\n\nThere is a configuration folder `~/.claude/`. \nIt contains `settings.json` for permissions and `CLAUDE.md` for global preferences.\n\n### VSCode\n\nSurprisingly to me, when I opened up a *Claude Code* console inside **VSCode**, it integrated seemlessly and immediately without\nany further setup necessary. For example, it shows diffs then using VSCode editor windows.\n\n## Claude stuff marketplace\n\nThe claude-stuff Claude \"marketplace\" provides 2 plugins, with a couple of SKILLs each\n- writing-clojure\n  - clojure-coding-conventions\n  - using-the-repl-to-eval-clojure-code (note: this is a nREPL [SKILL](https://github.com/bhauman/clojure-mcp-light/blob/main/skills/clojure-eval/SKILL.md) for using `clj-nrepl-eval` which I copied wholesale over; naturally we want to have that installed via `clojure-mcp-light` via `bbin`)\n- architecture\n  - architecture review\n\nSee [claude-marketplaces](./recipes/claude-marketplaces.md).\n"
