        "README.md": "# sentry-mcp\n\nSentry's MCP service is primarily designed for human-in-the-loop coding agents. Our tool selection and priorities are focused on developer workflows and debugging use cases, rather than providing a general-purpose MCP server for all Sentry functionality.\n\nThis remote MCP server acts as middleware to the upstream Sentry API, optimized for coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and similar development tools. It's based on [Cloudflare's work towards remote MCPs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou'll find everything you need to know by visiting the deployed service in production:\n\n<https://mcp.sentry.dev>\n\nIf you're looking to contribute, learn how it works, or to run this for self-hosted Sentry, continue below.\n\n### Claude Code Plugin\n\nInstall as a Claude Code plugin for automatic subagent delegation:\n\n```shell\nclaude plugin marketplace add getsentry/sentry-mcp\nclaude plugin install sentry-mcp@sentry-mcp\n```\n\nThis provides a `sentry-mcp` subagent that Claude automatically delegates to when you ask about Sentry errors, issues, traces, or performance.\n\nFor experimental features:\n\n```shell\nclaude plugin install sentry-mcp@sentry-mcp-experimental\n```\n\n### Stdio vs Remote\n\nWhile this repository is focused on acting as an MCP service, we also support a `stdio` transport. This is still a work in progress, but is the easiest way to adapt run the MCP against a self-hosted Sentry install.\n\n**Note:** The AI-powered search tools (`search_events`, `search_issues`, etc.) require an LLM provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). These tools use natural language processing to translate queries into Sentry's query syntax. Without a configured provider, these specific tools will be unavailable, but all other tools will function normally.\n\nTo utilize the `stdio` transport, you'll need to create an User Auth Token in Sentry with the necessary scopes. As of writing this is:\n\n```\norg:read\nproject:read\nproject:write\nteam:read\nteam:write\nevent:write\n```\n\nLaunch the transport:\n\n```shell\nnpx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=sentry-user-token\n```\n\nNeed to connect to a self-hosted deployment? Add <code>--host</code> (hostname\nonly, e.g. <code>--host=sentry.example.com</code>) when you run the command.\n\nSome features (like Seer) may not be available on self-hosted instances. You can\ndisable specific skills to prevent unsupported tools from being exposed:\n\n```shell\nnpx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=TOKEN --host=sentry.example.com --disable-skills=seer\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n```shell\nSENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=         # Required: Your Sentry auth token\n\n# LLM Provider Configuration (required for AI-powered search tools)\nEMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER=     # Required: 'openai' or 'anthropic'\nOPENAI_API_KEY=              # Required if using OpenAI\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=           # Required if using Anthropic\n\n# Optional overrides\nSENTRY_HOST=                 # For self-hosted deployments\nMCP_DISABLE_SKILLS=          # Disable specific skills (comma-separated, e.g. 'seer')\n```\n\n**Important:** Always set `EMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER` to explicitly specify your LLM provider. Auto-detection based on API keys alone is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. See [docs/embedded-agents.md](docs/embedded-agents.md) for detailed configuration options.\n\n#### Example MCP Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sentry\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@sentry/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your-token\",\n        \"EMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER\": \"openai\",\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"sk-...\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you leave the host variable unset, the CLI automatically targets the Sentry\nSaaS service. Only set the override when you operate self-hosted Sentry.\n\nFor self-hosted instances that don't support Seer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sentry\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@sentry/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your-token\",\n        \"SENTRY_HOST\": \"sentry.example.com\",\n        \"MCP_DISABLE_SKILLS\": \"seer\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### MCP Inspector\n\nMCP includes an [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector), to easily test the service:\n\n```shell\npnpm inspector\n```\n\nEnter the MCP server URL (<http://localhost:5173>) and hit connect. This should trigger the authentication flow for you.\n\nNote: If you have issues with your OAuth flow when accessing the inspector on `127.0.0.1`, try using `localhost` instead by visiting `http://localhost:6274`.\n\n## Local Development\n\nTo contribute changes, you'll need to set up your local environment:\n\n1. **Set up environment and agent skills:**\n\n   ```shell\n   make setup-env  # Creates .env files and installs shared agent skills\n   ```\n\n   This also runs `npx @sentry/dotagents install` to install shared skills from [getsentry/skills](https://github.com/getsentry/skills) into `.agents/skills/` (symlinked into `.claude/skills` and `.cursor/skills`). If you need to update skills later, run it directly:\n\n   ```shell\n   npx @sentry/dotagents install\n   ```\n\n2. **Create an OAuth App in Sentry** (Settings => API => [Applications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/applications/)):\n\n   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5173`\n   - Authorized Redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback`\n   - Note your Client ID and generate a Client secret\n\n3. **Configure your credentials:**\n\n   - Edit `.env` in the root directory and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n   - Edit `packages/mcp-cloudflare/.env` and add:\n     - `SENTRY_CLIENT_ID=your_development_sentry_client_id`\n     - `SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_development_sentry_client_secret`\n     - `COOKIE_SECRET=my-super-secret-cookie`\n\n4. **Start the development server:**\n\n   ```shell\n   pnpm dev\n   ```\n\n### Verify\n\nRun the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:5173`\n\n```shell\npnpm dev\n```\n\nTo test the local server, enter `http://localhost:5173/mcp` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to \"List Tools\".\n\n### Tests\n\nThere are three test suites included: unit tests, evaluations, and manual testing.\n\n**Unit tests** can be run using:\n\n```shell\npnpm test\n```\n\n**Evaluations** require a `.env` file in the project root with some config:\n\n```shell\n# .env (in project root)\nOPENAI_API_KEY=  # Also required for AI-powered search tools in production\n```\n\nNote: The root `.env` file provides defaults for all packages. Individual packages can have their own `.env` files to override these defaults during development.\n\nOnce that's done you can run them using:\n\n```shell\npnpm eval\n```\n\n**Manual testing** (preferred for testing MCP changes):\n\n```shell\n# Test with local dev server (default: http://localhost:5173)\npnpm -w run cli \"who am I?\"\n\n# Test agent mode (use_sentry tool only)\npnpm -w run cli --agent \"who am I?\"\n\n# Test against production\npnpm -w run cli --mcp-host=https://mcp.sentry.dev \"query\"\n\n# Test with local stdio mode (requires SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN)\npnpm -w run cli --access-token=TOKEN \"query\"\n```\n\nNote: The CLI defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. Override with `--mcp-host` or set `MCP_URL` environment variable.\n\n**Comprehensive testing playbooks:**\n- **Stdio testing:** See `docs/testing-stdio.md` for complete guide on building, running, and testing the stdio implementation (IDEs, MCP Inspector)\n- **Remote testing:** See `docs/testing-remote.md` for complete guide on testing the remote server (OAuth, web UI, CLI client)\n\n## Development Notes\n\n### Automated Code Review\n\nThis repository uses automated code review tools (like Cursor BugBot) to help identify potential issues in pull requests. These tools provide helpful feedback and suggestions, but **we do not recommend making these checks required** as the accuracy is still evolving and can produce false positives.\n\nThe automated reviews should be treated as:\n\n- ✅ **Helpful suggestions** to consider during code review\n- ✅ **Starting points** for discussion and improvement\n- ❌ **Not blocking requirements** for merging PRs\n- ❌ **Not replacements** for human code review\n\nWhen addressing automated feedback, focus on the underlying concerns rather than strictly following every suggestion.\n\n### Contributor Documentation\n\nLooking to contribute or explore the full documentation map? See `CLAUDE.md` (also available as `AGENTS.md`) for contributor workflows and the complete docs index. The `docs/` folder contains the per-topic guides and tool-integrated `.md` files.\n"

The marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) lists all available plugins:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    { \"name\": \"sentry-skills\", \"source\": \"./plugins/sentry-skills\" },\n    { \"name\": \"infra-skills\", \"source\": \"./plugins/infra-skills\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEach plugin lives in its own directory under `plugins/` with its own `plugin.json` manifest. Users can install individual plugins:\n\n```bash\n# Install just the global skills\nclaude plugin install sentry-skills@sentry-skills\n\n# Install domain-specific skills\nclaude plugin install infra-skills@sentry-skills\n```\n\nTo add a new domain-specific plugin:\n\n1. Create `plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n2. Add skills under `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/`\n3. Register the plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n\n### Vendoring Skills\n\nWe vendor (copy) skills and agents that we use regularly into this repository rather than depending on external sources at runtime. This approach:\n\n- **Ensures consistency** - Everyone on the team uses the same version of each skill\n- **Enables customization** - We can adapt skills to Sentry-specific conventions\n- **Improves reliability** - No external dependencies that could change or disappear\n\n#### Attribution\n\nWhen vendoring a skill or agent from an external source, retain proper attribution:\n\n1. **Add a comment** at the top of the file referencing the original source:\n   ```markdown\n   <!--\n   Based on [Original Name] by [Author/Org]:\n   https://github.com/example/original-source\n   -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Include a LICENSE file** in the skill directory if the original has specific licensing requirements:\n   ```\n   plugins/sentry-skills/skills/vendored-skill/\n   ├── SKILL.md\n   └── LICENSE      # Original license text\n   ```\n\n#### Example: code-simplifier\n\nThe `code-simplifier` agent is vendored from [Anthropic's official plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official). See the attribution comment at the top of the agent file.\n\n## References\n\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)\n- [Sentry Engineering Practices](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/)\n- [Skill Synthesis Guide](docs/skill-synthesis.md) — using your AI agent to research and improve skills\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n"

Host them in any git repo, discover them automatically, install with one command.\n\n**Multi-agent.** Configure Claude, Cursor, Codex, VS Code, and OpenCode from a single `agents.toml` -- skills, MCP servers, and hooks.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Initialize a new project\nnpx @sentry/dotagents init\n\n# Add a skill from a GitHub repo\nnpx @sentry/dotagents add getsentry/skills --name find-bugs\n\n# Or add all skills from a repo\nnpx @sentry/dotagents add getsentry/skills --all\n\n# Install all declared skills\nnpx @sentry/dotagents install\n```\n\nThis creates an `agents.toml`:\n\n```toml\nversion = 1\ngitignore = false\nagents = [\"claude\"]\n\n[[skills]]\nname = \"find-bugs\"\nsource = \"getsentry/skills\"\n```\n\nAnd a lockfile (`agents.lock`) pinning the exact commit and integrity hash.\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `init` | Create `agents.toml` and `.agents/skills/` |\n| `add <source>` | Add a skill dependency |\n| `remove <name>` | Remove a skill |\n| `install` | Install all dependencies from `agents.toml` |\n| `update [name]` | Update skills to latest versions |\n| `list` | Show installed skills and their status |\n| `sync` | Reconcile gitignore, symlinks, and verify state |\n\nAll commands accept `--user` to operate on user scope (`~/.agents/`) instead of the current project.\n\n### init\n\n```bash\ndotagents init [--agents claude,cursor] [--force]\n```\n\nInteractive mode prompts for agent targets, gitignore preference, and trust policy.\n\n### install\n\n```bash\ndotagents install [--frozen] [--force]\n```\n\nUse `--frozen` in CI to fail if the lockfile is missing or out of sync. Use `--force` to re-resolve everything from scratch.\n\n### add\n\n```bash\ndotagents add <source> [--name <name>] [--ref <ref>] [--all]\n```\n\nAdd a skill and install it. When a repo has one skill, it's added automatically. When multiple are found, use `--name` to pick one or `--all` to add them all as a wildcard entry.\n\n### remove\n\n```bash\ndotagents remove <name>\n```\n\nFor wildcard-sourced skills, adds the skill to the `exclude` list instead of removing the whole entry.\n\n### update\n\n```bash\ndotagents update [name]\n```\n\nFetches latest versions. Skips SHA-pinned refs. For wildcards, re-discovers all skills and adds or removes as needed. Prints a changelog.\n\n### list\n\n```bash\ndotagents list [--json]\n```\n\nStatus indicators: `✓` ok, `~` modified, `✗` missing, `?` unlocked.\n\n### sync\n\n```bash\ndotagents sync\n```\n\nAdopts orphaned skills, regenerates gitignore, verifies integrity, repairs symlinks and configs.\n\n## Source Formats\n\n```toml\n[[skills]]\nname = \"find-bugs\"\nsource = \"getsentry/skills\"              # GitHub repo\n\n[[skills]]\nname = \"review\"\nsource = \"getsentry/skills@v1.0.0\"       # Pinned to a ref\n\n[[skills]]\nname = \"internal\"\nsource = \"git:https://git.corp.dev/repo\"  # Non-GitHub git\n\n[[skills]]\nname = \"local\"\nsource = \"path:./my-skills/local-skill\"   # Local directory\n```\n\n## Wildcard Skills\n\nAdd all skills from a repo with a single entry. Use `exclude` to skip specific ones.\n\n```toml\n[[skills]]\nname = \"*\"\nsource = \"getsentry/skills\"\nexclude = [\"deprecated-skill\"]\n```\n\nOr from the CLI: `dotagents add getsentry/skills --all`\n\n## Agent Targets\n\nThe `agents` field tells dotagents which tools to configure.\n\n```toml\nagents = [\"claude\", \"cursor\"]\n```\n\n| Agent | Config Dir | MCP Config | Hooks |\n|-------|-----------|------------|-------|\n| `claude` | `.claude` | `.mcp.json` | `.claude/settings.json` |\n| `cursor` | `.cursor` | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `.cursor/hooks.json` |\n| `codex` | `.codex` | `.codex/config.toml` | -- |\n| `vscode` | `.vscode` | `.vscode/mcp.json` | `.claude/settings.json` |\n| `opencode` | `.claude` | `opencode.json` | -- |\n\n### Pi\n\n[Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) discovers skills from `.pi/skills/`. It is not listed as an `agents` target, so instead add a symlink target to your `agents.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[symlinks]\ntargets = [\".pi\"]\n```\n\nAfter running `dotagents install`, Pi will read skills from `.pi/skills/ -> .agents/skills/`.\n\nPi does not use dotagents for MCP configuration. If you use an MCP extension with Pi, configure it separately via `.pi/mcp.json`.\n\n## MCP Servers\n\nDeclare MCP servers once in `agents.toml` and dotagents generates the correct config file for each agent during `install` and `sync`.\n\n```toml\n# Stdio transport\n[[mcp]]\nname = \"github\"\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"]\nenv = [\"GITHUB_TOKEN\"]\n\n# HTTP transport (OAuth)\n[[mcp]]\nname = \"remote-api\"\nurl = \"https://mcp.example.com/sse\"\n```\n\nEach server uses either `command` (stdio) or `url` (HTTP), not both.\n\n## Hooks\n\nDeclare hooks once and dotagents writes the correct hook config for each agent that supports them (Claude, Cursor, VS Code).\n\n```toml\n[[hooks]]\nevent = \"PreToolUse\"\nmatcher = \"Bash\"\ncommand = \"my-lint-check\"\n\n[[hooks]]\nevent = \"Stop\"\ncommand = \"notify-done\"\n```\n\nSupported events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`.\n\n## Trust\n\nRestrict which skill sources are allowed by adding a `[trust]` section. Without it, all sources are allowed.\n\n```toml\n[trust]\ngithub_orgs = [\"getsentry\"]\ngithub_repos = [\"external-org/specific-repo\"]\ngit_domains = [\"git.corp.example.com\"]\n```\n\nLocal `path:` sources are always allowed.\n\n## User Scope\n\nUse `--user` to manage skills shared across all projects:\n\n```bash\ndotagents --user init\ndotagents --user add getsentry/skills --all\n```\n\nUser-scope files live in `~/.agents/` (override with `DOTAGENTS_HOME`).\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Skills are declared in `agents.toml` at the project root\n2. `install` clones repos, discovers skills by convention, and copies them into `.agents/skills/`\n3. `agents.lock` records the resolved commit and a SHA-256 integrity hash\n4. By default (`gitignore = false`), skills are checked into git so collaborators get them immediately. Set `gitignore = true` to auto-generate `.agents/.gitignore` and exclude managed skills instead.\n5. Symlinks connect `.agents/skills/` to wherever your tools look (configured via the `agents` field)\n6. MCP and hook configs are generated for each declared agent\n\n## Checking In Skills\n\nBy default, `init` sets `gitignore = false` so installed skills are committed to git. Anyone cloning the repo gets skills immediately -- they only need dotagents when adding or updating skills.\n\nTo gitignore managed skills instead, set `gitignore = true` in `agents.toml`. Collaborators must run `dotagents install` after cloning.\n\n## Contributing\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:getsentry/dotagents.git\ncd dotagents\npnpm install\npnpm check  # lint + typecheck + test\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
