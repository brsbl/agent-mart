        "README.md": "# sentry-mcp\n\nSentry's MCP service is primarily designed for human-in-the-loop coding agents. Our tool selection and priorities are focused on developer workflows and debugging use cases, rather than providing a general-purpose MCP server for all Sentry functionality.\n\nThis remote MCP server acts as middleware to the upstream Sentry API, optimized for coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and similar development tools. It's based on [Cloudflare's work towards remote MCPs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou'll find everything you need to know by visiting the deployed service in production:\n\n<https://mcp.sentry.dev>\n\nIf you're looking to contribute, learn how it works, or to run this for self-hosted Sentry, continue below.\n\n### Claude Code Plugin\n\nInstall as a Claude Code plugin for automatic subagent delegation:\n\n```shell\nclaude plugin marketplace add getsentry/sentry-mcp\nclaude plugin install sentry-mcp@sentry-mcp\n```\n\nThis provides a `sentry-mcp` subagent that Claude automatically delegates to when you ask about Sentry errors, issues, traces, or performance.\n\nFor experimental features:\n\n```shell\nclaude plugin install sentry-mcp@sentry-mcp-experimental\n```\n\n### Stdio vs Remote\n\nWhile this repository is focused on acting as an MCP service, we also support a `stdio` transport. This is still a work in progress, but is the easiest way to adapt run the MCP against a self-hosted Sentry install.\n\n**Note:** The AI-powered search tools (`search_events`, `search_issues`, etc.) require an LLM provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). These tools use natural language processing to translate queries into Sentry's query syntax. Without a configured provider, these specific tools will be unavailable, but all other tools will function normally.\n\nTo utilize the `stdio` transport, you'll need to create an User Auth Token in Sentry with the necessary scopes. As of writing this is:\n\n```\norg:read\nproject:read\nproject:write\nteam:read\nteam:write\nevent:write\n```\n\nLaunch the transport:\n\n```shell\nnpx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=sentry-user-token\n```\n\nNeed to connect to a self-hosted deployment? Add <code>--host</code> (hostname\nonly, e.g. <code>--host=sentry.example.com</code>) when you run the command.\n\nSome features (like Seer) may not be available on self-hosted instances. You can\ndisable specific skills to prevent unsupported tools from being exposed:\n\n```shell\nnpx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=TOKEN --host=sentry.example.com --disable-skills=seer\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n```shell\nSENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=         # Required: Your Sentry auth token\n\n# LLM Provider Configuration (required for AI-powered search tools)\nEMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER=     # Required: 'openai' or 'anthropic'\nOPENAI_API_KEY=              # Required if using OpenAI\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=           # Required if using Anthropic\n\n# Optional overrides\nSENTRY_HOST=                 # For self-hosted deployments\nMCP_DISABLE_SKILLS=          # Disable specific skills (comma-separated, e.g. 'seer')\n```\n\n**Important:** Always set `EMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER` to explicitly specify your LLM provider. Auto-detection based on API keys alone is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. See [docs/embedded-agents.md](docs/embedded-agents.md) for detailed configuration options.\n\n#### Example MCP Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sentry\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@sentry/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your-token\",\n        \"EMBEDDED_AGENT_PROVIDER\": \"openai\",\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"sk-...\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you leave the host variable unset, the CLI automatically targets the Sentry\nSaaS service. Only set the override when you operate self-hosted Sentry.\n\nFor self-hosted instances that don't support Seer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sentry\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@sentry/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"your-token\",\n        \"SENTRY_HOST\": \"sentry.example.com\",\n        \"MCP_DISABLE_SKILLS\": \"seer\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### MCP Inspector\n\nMCP includes an [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector), to easily test the service:\n\n```shell\npnpm inspector\n```\n\nEnter the MCP server URL (<http://localhost:5173>) and hit connect. This should trigger the authentication flow for you.\n\nNote: If you have issues with your OAuth flow when accessing the inspector on `127.0.0.1`, try using `localhost` instead by visiting `http://localhost:6274`.\n\n## Local Development\n\nTo contribute changes, you'll need to set up your local environment:\n\n1. **Set up environment files:**\n\n   ```shell\n   make setup-env  # Creates both .env files from examples\n   ```\n\n2. **Create an OAuth App in Sentry** (Settings => API => [Applications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/applications/)):\n\n   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5173`\n   - Authorized Redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback`\n   - Note your Client ID and generate a Client secret\n\n3. **Configure your credentials:**\n\n   - Edit `.env` in the root directory and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n   - Edit `packages/mcp-cloudflare/.env` and add:\n     - `SENTRY_CLIENT_ID=your_development_sentry_client_id`\n     - `SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_development_sentry_client_secret`\n     - `COOKIE_SECRET=my-super-secret-cookie`\n\n4. **Start the development server:**\n\n   ```shell\n   pnpm dev\n   ```\n\n### Verify\n\nRun the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:5173`\n\n```shell\npnpm dev\n```\n\nTo test the local server, enter `http://localhost:5173/mcp` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to \"List Tools\".\n\n### Tests\n\nThere are three test suites included: unit tests, evaluations, and manual testing.\n\n**Unit tests** can be run using:\n\n```shell\npnpm test\n```\n\n**Evaluations** require a `.env` file in the project root with some config:\n\n```shell\n# .env (in project root)\nOPENAI_API_KEY=  # Also required for AI-powered search tools in production\n```\n\nNote: The root `.env` file provides defaults for all packages. Individual packages can have their own `.env` files to override these defaults during development.\n\nOnce that's done you can run them using:\n\n```shell\npnpm eval\n```\n\n**Manual testing** (preferred for testing MCP changes):\n\n```shell\n# Test with local dev server (default: http://localhost:5173)\npnpm -w run cli \"who am I?\"\n\n# Test agent mode (use_sentry tool only)\npnpm -w run cli --agent \"who am I?\"\n\n# Test against production\npnpm -w run cli --mcp-host=https://mcp.sentry.dev \"query\"\n\n# Test with local stdio mode (requires SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN)\npnpm -w run cli --access-token=TOKEN \"query\"\n```\n\nNote: The CLI defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. Override with `--mcp-host` or set `MCP_URL` environment variable.\n\n**Comprehensive testing playbooks:**\n- **Stdio testing:** See `docs/testing-stdio.md` for complete guide on building, running, and testing the stdio implementation (IDEs, MCP Inspector)\n- **Remote testing:** See `docs/testing-remote.md` for complete guide on testing the remote server (OAuth, web UI, CLI client)\n\n## Development Notes\n\n### Automated Code Review\n\nThis repository uses automated code review tools (like Cursor BugBot) to help identify potential issues in pull requests. These tools provide helpful feedback and suggestions, but **we do not recommend making these checks required** as the accuracy is still evolving and can produce false positives.\n\nThe automated reviews should be treated as:\n\n- ✅ **Helpful suggestions** to consider during code review\n- ✅ **Starting points** for discussion and improvement\n- ❌ **Not blocking requirements** for merging PRs\n- ❌ **Not replacements** for human code review\n\nWhen addressing automated feedback, focus on the underlying concerns rather than strictly following every suggestion.\n\n### Contributor Documentation\n\nLooking to contribute or explore the full documentation map? See `CLAUDE.md` (also available as `AGENTS.md`) for contributor workflows and the complete docs index. The `docs/` folder contains the per-topic guides and tool-integrated `.md` files.\n"

Each skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.\n\n#### Skill Template\n\nCreate a new directory under `plugins/sentry-skills/skills/`:\n\n```\nplugins/sentry-skills/skills/my-skill/\n└── SKILL.md\n```\n\n**SKILL.md format:**\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it. Include keywords that help agents identify when this skill is relevant.\n---\n\n# My Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\n\nStep-by-step guidance for the agent.\n\n## Examples\n\nConcrete examples showing expected input/output.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Specific rules to follow\n- Edge cases to handle\n```\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n\n- **name**: 1-64 characters, lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens only\n- **description**: Up to 1024 characters, include trigger keywords\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; split longer content into reference files\n\n#### Optional Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `license` | License name or path to license file |\n| `compatibility` | Environment requirements (max 500 chars) |\n| `allowed-tools` | Comma-separated list of tools the skill can use |\n| `metadata` | Arbitrary key-value pairs for additional properties |\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does\nlicense: Apache-2.0\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n```\n\n### Where Skills Belong\n\nSkills should live in the appropriate location based on their scope:\n\n| Scope | Location | Example |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| **Global** - Used across Sentry | `sentry-skills` plugin | `commit`, `code-review`, `create-pr` |\n| **Domain-specific** - Used by a team or domain | Dedicated plugin in this repo (e.g., `infra-skills`) | `gcp-logs`, `terraform-review` |\n| **Repo-specific** - Only relevant to one repo | The repository itself (`.claude/skills/`) | Project-specific workflows |\n\nWhen deciding where to place a skill:\n- If most Sentry engineers would benefit, add it to `sentry-skills`\n- If only a specific team needs it, create or use a domain-specific plugin\n- If it only makes sense in one repo, keep it in that repo\n\n#### Marketplace Structure\n\nThis repository is a Claude Code **marketplace** - a collection of plugins that can be installed independently. The marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) lists all available plugins:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    { \"name\": \"sentry-skills\", \"source\": \"./plugins/sentry-skills\" },\n    { \"name\": \"infra-skills\", \"source\": \"./plugins/infra-skills\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEach plugin lives in its own directory under `plugins/` with its own `plugin.json` manifest. Users can install individual plugins:\n\n```bash\n# Install just the global skills\nclaude plugin install sentry-skills@sentry-skills\n\n# Install domain-specific skills\nclaude plugin install infra-skills@sentry-skills\n```\n\nTo add a new domain-specific plugin:\n\n1. Create `plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`\n2. Add skills under `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/`\n3. Register the plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n\n### Vendoring Skills\n\nWe vendor (copy) skills and agents that we use regularly into this repository rather than depending on external sources at runtime. This approach:\n\n- **Ensures consistency** - Everyone on the team uses the same version of each skill\n- **Enables customization** - We can adapt skills to Sentry-specific conventions\n- **Improves reliability** - No external dependencies that could change or disappear\n\n#### Attribution\n\nWhen vendoring a skill or agent from an external source, retain proper attribution:\n\n1. **Add a comment** at the top of the file referencing the original source:\n   ```markdown\n   <!--\n   Based on [Original Name] by [Author/Org]:\n   https://github.com/example/original-source\n   -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Include a LICENSE file** in the skill directory if the original has specific licensing requirements:\n   ```\n   plugins/sentry-skills/skills/vendored-skill/\n   ├── SKILL.md\n   └── LICENSE      # Original license text\n   ```\n\n#### Example: code-simplifier\n\nThe `code-simplifier` agent is vendored from [Anthropic's official plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official). See the attribution comment at the top of the agent file.\n\n## References\n\n- [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)\n- [Sentry Engineering Practices](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/)\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n"
