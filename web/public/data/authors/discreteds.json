        "README.md": "# Competition Scout\n\nA suite of Claude Code skills for scraping \"25 words or less\" competitions, analyzing strategy, composing entries, and persisting to GitHub.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **comp-scout-scrape** | Scrape competitions.com.au and netrewards.com.au with LLM-enhanced interpretation |\n| **comp-scout-analyze** | Generate strategic analysis (tone, themes, angles) for a competition |\n| **comp-scout-compose** | Create 25-words-or-less entries with multiple variations |\n| **comp-scout-persist** | Store competitions as GitHub issues with project integration |\n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\n# Install Python dependencies\npip install -e .\n\n# Install Playwright browser\nplaywright install chromium\n```\n\n\n### 2. Install the Plugin\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add discreteds/competition-scout\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install competition-scout@competition-scout\n```\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\ncompetition-scout/\n├── skills/\n│   ├── comp-scout-scrape/      # Playwright + LLM interpretation\n│   ├── comp-scout-analyze/     # Pure SKILL.md workflow\n│   ├── comp-scout-compose/     # Pure SKILL.md workflow\n│   └── comp-scout-persist/     # gh CLI + hiivmind-pulse-gh\n├── lib/\n│   └── schemas/\n│       └── competition.yaml    # Shared data schemas\n├── pyproject.toml              # Minimal deps (playwright only)\n└── CLAUDE.md                   # Skill documentation\n```\n\n## Data Flow\n\n```\nScrape → Competition data\n           │\n           ├─────────────────┐\n           ▼                 ▼\n       Persist          Analyze → Strategy\n                             │\n                             ▼\n                         Compose → Entries\n                             │\n                             ▼\n                     Persist (add to issue)\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n### LLM-Enhanced Scraping\nUnlike regex-based scrapers, Claude interprets page content to extract:\n- Draw date and winner notification date\n- The actual prompt (even when buried in marketing copy)\n- Brand voice and context\n\n### Simplified Deduplication\nCompetitions are deduplicated by fuzzy title matching (80% threshold). Duplicates from other sites are added as **comments** on existing issues - no complex parent-child relationships.\n\n### Issue as Dumping Ground\nEach competition issue collects all related info via comments:\n- Additional sources from other aggregator sites\n- Strategy analysis\n- Draft entries\n- Submission confirmation\n- Winner notification\n\n## Persistence\n\nCompetition data is stored in a **separate repository** (not this skills repo). Configure your target repo when using `comp-scout-persist`.\n\nRequires:\n- `gh` CLI authenticated\n- hiivmind-pulse-gh workspace initialized\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- [comp-scout](https://github.com/discreteds/comp-scout) - Original Python implementation (being refactored into these skills)\n- [hiivmind-pulse-gh](https://github.com/hiivmind/hiivmind-pulse-gh) - GitHub Projects integration skills\n"
