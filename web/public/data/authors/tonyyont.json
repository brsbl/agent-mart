First run walks you through setup (~2 min):\n- Your name and who you're dating\n- Your city\n- Food preferences, date style, budget\n- Things you want to try\n\nIt then auto-discovers popular venues in your city.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | What it does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/date-plan` | Plan a date with concrete options |\n| `/events` | Find events in your city |\n| `/venue-watch` | Track venues and artists |\n| `/find-class` | Find classes and experiences |\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Setup**: Tell it about yourselves — names, city, food prefs, date style\n2. **Plan**: Get 3-5 concrete date options with real venues, times, and costs\n3. **Track**: Log dates, rate them, see your category balance\n4. **Grow**: Your venue list and preferences evolve as you use it\n\n## Optional: API Keys\n\ndate-planner works out of the box using web search. For richer event data:\n\n### Ticketmaster (free)\nBetter structured music and theater results.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/datekit\necho 'TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your-key-here' > ~/.config/datekit/.env\n```\n\nGet a free key at https://developer.ticketmaster.com\n\n### Google Places (free $200/month credit)\nRestaurant discovery with ratings and hours.\n\n```bash\necho 'GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-key-here' >> ~/.config/datekit/.env\n```\n\n## Date Categories\n\n| Category | Energy | Examples |\n|----------|--------|----------|\n| Adventure | High | Hiking, concerts, martial arts, sports |\n| Creative | Medium | Pottery, cooking class, stained glass |\n| Explore | Medium | Estate sales, neighborhoods, museums, markets |\n| Nourish | Low-Med | Restaurant discovery, food tours, cooking together |\n| Recharge | Low | Spa, beach, movie night, scenic drives |\n"
