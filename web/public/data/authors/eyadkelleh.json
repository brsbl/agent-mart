However, its size and breadth can be overwhelming. This project:\n\n- **Curates essential lists** most commonly needed for security testing\n- **Organizes by category** for easy discovery and access\n- **Integrates with Claude Code** for seamless workflow integration\n- **Provides clear documentation** on when and how to use each resource\n- **Emphasizes ethical use** with clear guidelines and warnings\n\n## Source & Attribution\n\nAll security testing resources in this repository are sourced from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) by Daniel Miessler and contributors.\n\n- **Original Repository:** https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists\n- **License:** MIT License\n- **Maintainer:** Daniel Miessler\n- **Contributors:** Security community worldwide\n\nThis project is a curated, skill-packaged subset for Claude Code integration. For the complete SecLists collection (4.5GB, 6,000+ files), visit the original repository.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When Using Password Lists\n- Only test against systems you own or have written authorization to test\n- Implement rate limiting to avoid account lockouts\n- Monitor for defensive responses (WAF blocks, account locks)\n- Use appropriate delays between attempts\n\n### When Using Fuzzing Payloads\n- Test in isolated environments first\n- Validate input sanitization and output encoding\n- Check for secondary effects (logs, monitoring alerts)\n- Document all findings systematically\n\n### When Using Web Shells\n- Only use for detection system validation\n- Test in isolated lab environments\n- Never deploy on production systems\n- Focus on defensive detection capabilities\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! If you'd like to:\n\n- Add new curated wordlists\n- Improve documentation\n- Fix errors or update outdated information\n- Suggest additional skills\n\nPlease open an issue or pull request.\n\n## Documentation and References\n\n- [SecLists Official Repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)\n- [OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)\n- [Bug Bounty Platforms](https://github.com/disclose/bug-bounty-platforms)\n- [Responsible Disclosure Guidelines](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - Use responsibly with proper authorization.\n\nThis is a curated collection and redistribution of SecLists content.

        "README.md": "# Apple Foundation Models Skill – README\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository contains comprehensive reference documentation and guidance for Apple's Foundation Models framework on iOS 26+ and macOS 26+. It serves as a complete skill guide for developers building on-device AI capabilities using Apple's on-device language models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide clear, organized documentation on how to:\n\n- Integrate Apple's on-device language models using the FoundationModels framework\n- Build and configure skills that leverage SystemLanguageModel for on-device inference\n- Implement advanced patterns including guided generation, tool calling, and streaming responses\n- Handle safety, localization, and performance considerations for on-device AI\n\n## The Skill Covers\n\n- **On-device LLM integration** using the FoundationModels framework\n- **SystemLanguageModel** – Apple's on-device language model API\n- **LanguageModelSession** – Managing conversations and model interactions\n- **Guided Generation** – Generating structured Swift types from prompts\n- **Tool Calling** – Extending model capabilities with custom tools and integrations\n- **Prompting** – Crafting effective prompts and system instructions\n- **Safety** – Implementing guardrails and handling sensitive content\n- **Localization** – Supporting multilingual AI features\n- **Performance** – Optimization patterns and best practices\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Xcode 17** or later with Foundation Models support\n- **iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, or visionOS 26** (or later)\n- Swift and SwiftUI basic knowledge (for implementation)\n- Device or simulator that supports Apple Intelligence and the Foundation Models framework\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install as a Claude Code Skill\n\nThis skill is available in the Claude Code marketplace. To install it:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add Eyadkelleh/apple_foundation_models_claude_skill\n```\n\nThen install the skill:\n\n```\n/plugin install apple-foundation-models@apple-foundation-models-marketplace\n```\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code will automatically suggest this skill when you're working with Apple Foundation Models.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Clone the Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Eyadkelleh/apple_foundation_models_claude_skill.git\ncd apple_foundation_models_claude_skill\n```\n\n### 2. Explore the Documentation\n\nThe repository is organized into focused reference guides:\n\n- **[Getting Started](references/getting_started.md)** – Initial setup and basic patterns\n- **[Prompting](references/prompting.md)** – How to craft effective prompts and instructions\n- **[Guided Generation](references/guided_generation.md)** – Generating structured outputs\n- **[Tool Calling](references/tool_calling.md)** – Extending models with custom tools\n- **[Safety](references/safety.md)** – Guardrails and safety considerations\n- **[Localization](references/localization.md)** – Multilingual support\n- **[API Reference](references/api_reference.md)** – Complete API documentation\n- **[Advanced](references/advanced.md)** – Advanced patterns and use cases\n\n### 3. Understand the Skill Metadata\n\nReview [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for a structured overview of all APIs and when to use this skill.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Core Pattern\n\nThe Foundation Models framework provides a simple API for on-device inference:\n\n```swift\n// 1. Access the on-device language model\nlet model = SystemLanguageModel(useCase: .general)\n\n// 2. Create a session with custom instructions\nlet instructions = Instructions(\"\"\"\nYou are a helpful assistant that summarizes documents concisely.\nFocus on key points and maintain accuracy.\n\"\"\")\nlet session = LanguageModelSession(\n    model: model,\n    instructions: instructions\n)\n\n// 3. Send prompts and handle responses\nlet response = try await session.respond(to: Prompt(\"Summarize this text...\"))\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **On-Device Processing**: All models run entirely on-device with no external API calls\n- **Privacy-First**: User data never leaves the device\n- **Zero Configuration**: No API keys or external service setup required\n- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming for responsive UIs\n- **Structured Generation**: Generate Swift types directly with guided generation\n- **Extensible**: Define custom tools for dynamic capabilities\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\napple_foundation_models_claude_skill/\n├── README.md                 # This file\n├── SKILL.md                  # Skill metadata and API overview\n└── references/               # Detailed documentation\n    ├── index.md             # Documentation index\n    ├── getting_started.md   # Getting started guide\n    ├── prompting.md         # Prompting strategies\n    ├── guided_generation.md # Structured output generation\n    ├── tool_calling.md      # Custom tool integration\n    ├── safety.md            # Safety and guardrails\n    ├── localization.md      # Multilingual support\n    ├── api_reference.md     # Complete API reference\n    └── advanced.md          # Advanced patterns\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Basic Text Generation\n\n```swift\nlet model = SystemLanguageModel(useCase: .general)\nlet session = LanguageModelSession(model: model)\nlet response = try await session.respond(\n    to: Prompt(\"Write a haiku about Swift programming\")\n)\n```\n\n### Guided Generation (Structured Output)\n\n```swift\nstruct TaskItem: Generable {\n    let title: String\n    let priority: String\n    let dueDate: String\n}\n\nlet tasks = try await session.respond(\n    generating: [TaskItem].self,\n    prompt: Prompt(\"Extract tasks from this email...\")\n)\n```\n\n### Tool Calling\n\n```swift\nstruct WeatherTool: Tool {\n    func call(arguments: String) async throws -> String {\n        // Fetch and return weather data\n        return \"Current weather: ...\"\n    }\n}\n\nlet session = LanguageModelSession(\n    model: model,\n    tools: [WeatherTool()]\n)\n```\n\n### Streaming Responses\n\n```swift\nlet stream = try await session.streamResponse(\n    to: Prompt(\"Tell me a story...\")\n)\n\nfor try await chunk in stream {\n    print(chunk.text)\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Workflow\n\n1. **Choose Your Use Case** – Start with the appropriate `SystemLanguageModel.UseCase`\n2. **Define Instructions** – Set clear behavioral guidelines for your model\n3. **Handle Availability** – Check for model availability on the current device\n4. **Build Your Session** – Create a `LanguageModelSession` with your configuration\n5. **Process Responses** – Handle streaming or final responses in your UI\n6. **Add Tools** (Optional) – Extend capabilities with custom tool implementations\n7. **Implement Safety** – Add guardrails appropriate for your use case\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Prompting**: Be specific and detailed in your prompts for better results\n- **Instructions**: Define the model's role and behavior upfront with clear instructions\n- **Safety**: Enable guardrails for content that touches on safety-sensitive topics\n- **Performance**: Use `prewarm()` to initialize models before critical moments\n- **Streaming**: Leverage `streamResponse()` for immediate user feedback\n- **Localization**: Test with multiple languages if supporting international users\n- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for generation failures and unavailable models\n\n## Documentation and References\n\n- [Apple Developer – Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels)\n- [WWDC 2024 – Meet the Foundation Models framework](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/)\n- [Structured API Reference](references/api_reference.md) – In this repository\n- [Getting Started Guide](references/getting_started.md) – In this repository\n\n## License\n\n[Specify your license here (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, or proprietary)]\n\n---\n\n**Note**: This is a reference and documentation repository.
