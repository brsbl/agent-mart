Every decision flows through this loop, creating a compounding record of organizational judgment.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **FETCH**: Loads cognitive context (past decisions, calibration, patterns, guardrails) at session start\n- **ORIENT**: Checks guardrails and constraints before every non-trivial decision via `pre_action`\n- **RESOLVE**: Streams micro-thought deliberation (10+ atomic signals per decision) via `record_thought`\n- **GO**: Executes with confidence, gates HIGH/CRITICAL decisions on user confirmation\n- **EXTRACT**: Reviews outcomes and distills patterns via `review_outcome`\n\n## Components\n\n- **Skill** (`skills/forge-protocol/SKILL.md`): Protocol rules loaded contextually\n- **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`): SessionStart injects protocol, PreToolUse gates risky file ops, Stop enforces reflection\n- **MCP** (`.mcp.json`): Connects to the decisions server\n- **Commands**: `/forge:status` dashboard, `/forge:reflect` batch review\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir ./path-to-forge-plugin\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Decisions MCP server running (default: http://192.168.1.141:9991/mcp)\n- Python 3 for hook scripts\n"
