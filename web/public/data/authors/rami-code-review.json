Install the GitHub App\n\n[Install Rami](https://github.com/apps/rami-code-remeow) on your repository to enable code review.\n\n### 2. Add the Marketplace\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add rami-code-review/claude-code-marketplace\n```\n\n### 3. Install the Plugin\n\n```\n/plugin install rami@rami-code-review\n```\n\n### 4. Run a Review\n\nOpen a PR branch in Claude Code and run:\n\n```\n/rami:review\n```\n\nRami will review your changes, show you the issues, and help fix them one by one.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/rami:review`\n\nRuns a full review cycle on your current PR branch. Rami will:\n\n- Fetch review results for your PR\n- Walk through each issue by priority (blocking → high → medium → low)\n- Either fix the issue or let you dispute it with evidence\n- Commit and push the fixes\n- Repeat until the review is clean (up to 5 iterations)\n\n### `/rami:status`\n\nQuick check on your review status without triggering a new review. Useful when you want to see if a previous review has completed.\n\n### `/rami:usage`\n\nCheck your remaining review quota and credit balance.\n\n## Disputing Issues\n\nNot every issue Rami finds needs to be fixed. You can dispute issues with evidence:\n\n- **False positive** — The code is actually correct\n- **Framework guarantee** — The framework handles this case\n- **Intentional design** — This is by design, not a mistake\n- **Duplicate** — Same issue reported elsewhere\n\nRami will evaluate your dispute and either accept it or ask you to fix the issue.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"No PR found for branch\"**\nMake sure you've pushed your branch and created a pull request.\n\n**\"Authentication required\"**\nInstall the [Rami GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/rami-code-remeow) on your repository.\n\n**Review taking too long?**\nUse `/rami:status` to check progress without triggering a new review.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Rami Website](https://rami.reviews)\n- [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/rami-code-remeow)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
