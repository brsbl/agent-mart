Now there is a Chinese translation by [Sepine Tam](https://github.com/sepine) and [StataMCP-Team](https://github.com/statamcp-team) 🎉\n> - Jupyter Lab Usage (Important: Stata 17+) [here](source/docs/JupyterStata.md) and [nbstata](https://github.com/hugetim/nbstata)\n</details>\n\n## 💡 Quickly Start\n### Use Stata-MCP in Claude Code\nWe can use Stata-MCP in Claude Code as its prefect agentic ability. \n\nBefore using it, please make sure you have ever install `Claude Code`, if you don't know how to install it, visit on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)\n\nYou can open your terminal and `cd` to your working directory, and run:\n```bash\nclaude mcp add stata-mcp --env STATA_MCP_CWD=$(pwd) --scope project -- uvx --directory $(pwd) stata-mcp\n```\n\nIn your working directory, you can find a file named `.mcp.json`, your mcp config will be placed here. \n\nIf you want to install Stata-MCP globally, you can run:\n```bash\nclaude mcp add stata-mcp --scope user -- uvx stata-mcp\n```\n\nThen, you can use Stata-MCP in Claude Code. Here are some scenarios for using it:\n\n- **Paper Replication**: Replicate empirical studies from economics papers\n- **Quick Hypothesis Testing**: Validate economic hypotheses through regression analysis\n- **Stata Learning Assistant**: Learn econometrics with step-by-step Stata explanations\n- **Code Organization**: Review and optimize existing Stata do-files\n- **Result Interpretation**: Understand complex statistical outputs and regression results\n\n### Install Claude Code Plugin\nWe provide official native plugin, integrating [Stata-MCP](https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp) maintained by @sepinetam and [Stata LSP](https://github.com/euglevi/stata-language-server) maintained by @euglevi. Installation commands:\n```bash\n# Install stata-mcp marketplace first\nclaude plugin marketplace add sepinetam/stata-mcp\n\n# Install plugin to local, project or user scope\nclaude plugin install stata-toolbox -s local\n```\n\n### Agent Mode\nThe details of agent mode find [here](source/agent_examples/README.md).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp.git\ncd stata-mcp\n\nuv sync\nuv pip install -e .\n\nstata-mcp --version  # for test whether stata-mcp is installed successfully.\nstata-mcp agent run  # now you can enjoy your stata-mcp agent mode.\n```\n\nor you can directly use it with `uvx`:\n```bash\nuvx stata-mcp --version  # for test whether it could be used on your computer.\nuvx stata-mcp agent run\n```\n\nYou can edit the task in `agent_examples/openai/main.py` for variable `[model_instructions](source/agent_examples/openai/main.py#L37)` and `[task_message](source/agent_examples/openai/main.py#L68)`\n\n### Agent as Tool\nIf you want to use a Stata-Agent in another agent, [here](source/docs/Usages/agent_as/agent_as_tool.md) is a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\nfrom stata_mcp.agent_as.agent_as_tool import StataAgent\n\n# init stata agent and set as tool\nstata_agent = StataAgent()\nsa_tool = stata_agent.as_tool()\n\n# Create main Agent\nagent = Agent(\n    name=\"Assistant\",\n    instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\",\n    tools=[sa_tool],\n)\n\n\n# Then run the agent as usual.\nasync def main(task: str, max_turns: int = 30):\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, input=task, max_turns=max_turns)\n    return result\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    econ_task = \"Use Stata default data to find out the relationship between mpg and price.\"\n    asyncio.run(main(econ_task))\n\n```\n\n\n### AI Chat-Bot Client Mode\n> Standard config requires: please make sure the stata is installed at the default path, and the stata cli (for macOS and Linux) exists.\n\nThe standard config json as follows, you can DIY your config via add envs.\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"stata-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"stata-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more detailed usage information, visit the [Usage guide](source/docs/Usages/Usage.md). \n\nAnd some advanced usage, visit the [Advanced guide](source/docs/Usages/Advanced.md)\n\n### Prerequisites\n- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Package installer and virtual environment manager\n- Claude, Cline, ChatWise, or other LLM service\n- Stata License\n- Your API-KEY from LLM\n\n> Notes:\n> 1. If you are located in China, a short uv usage document you can find [here](source/docs/ChinaUsers/uv.md).\n> 2. Claude is the best choice for Stata-MCP, for Chinese, I recommend to use DeepSeek as your model provider as it is cheap and powerful, also the score is highest in China provider, if you are increased in it, visit the report [How to use StataMCP improve your social science research](https://statamcp.com/reports/2025/09/21/stata_mcp_a_research_report_on_ai_assisted_empirical_research).\n\n### Installation\nFor the new version, you don't need to install the `stata-mcp` package again, you can just use the following command to check whether your computer can use stata-mcp.\n```bash\nuvx stata-mcp --usable\nuvx stata-mcp --version\n```\n\nIf you want to use it locally, you can install it via pip or download the source code.\n\n**Download via pip**\n```bash\npip install stata-mcp\n```\n\n**Download source code and compile**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp.git\ncd stata-mcp\n\nuv build\n```\nThen you can find the compiled `stata-mcp` binary in the `dist` directory. You can use it directly or add it to your PATH.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nuvx /path/to/your/whl/stata_mcp-1.13.0-py3-non-any.whl  # here is the wheel file name, you can change it to your version\n```\n\n## 📝 Documentation\n\n### Core Documentation\n- **[Complete Documentation](docs/)**: Full documentation site with all features\n- **[Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)**: Unified TOML-based configuration system\n- **[Security Guard](docs/security.md)**: Security validation for dangerous commands\n- **[Monitoring System](docs/monitoring.md)**: RAM monitoring and resource limits\n- **[Architecture Overview](docs/overview.md)**: System design and integration patterns\n\n### Usage Guides\n- For more detailed usage information, visit the [Usage guide](source/docs/Usages/Usage.md)\n- Advanced Usage, visit the [Advanced](source/docs/Usages/Advanced.md)\n- Some questions, visit the [Questions](source/docs/Usages/Questions.md)\n- Difference with [Stata-MCP@hanlulong](https://github.com/hanlulong/stata-mcp), visit the [Difference](source/docs/Difference.md)\n\n### Key Features\n- **[Security Guard](docs/security.md)**: Blocks dangerous commands (`!`, `shell`, `erase`, etc.)\n- **[RAM Monitoring](docs/monitoring.md)**: Prevents memory exhaustion with configurable limits\n- **[Unified Configuration](docs/configuration.md)**: TOML config + environment variables\n- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n- Automatic log capture and error reporting\n\n## 💡 Questions\n- [Cherry Studio 32000 wrong](source/docs/Usages/Questions.md#cherry-studio-32000-wrong)\n- [Cherry Studio 32000 error](source/docs/Usages/Questions.md#cherry-studio-32000-error)\n- [Windows Support](source/docs/Usages/Questions.md#windows-supports)\n- [Network Errors When Running Stata-MCP](source/docs/Usages/Questions.md#network-errors-when-running-stata-mcp)\n\n## 🚀 Roadmap\n- [x] macOS support\n- [x] Windows support\n- [ ] Additional LLM integrations (With a new webUI)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations (Via prompt and context engineering)\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Statement](source/docs/Rights/Statement.md).\n\n## 🐛 Report Issues\nIf you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp/issues/new).\n\n## 📄 License\n[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)\n\n## 📚 Citation\nIf you use Stata-MCP in your research, please cite this repository using one of the following formats:\n\n### BibTeX\n```bibtex\n@software{sepinetam2025stata,\n  author = {Song Tan},\n  title = {Stata-MCP: Let LLM help you achieve your regression analysis with Stata},\n  year = {2025},\n  url = {https://github.com/sepinetam/stata-mcp},\n  version = {1.13.0}\n}\n```\n\n### APA\n```\nSong Tan.
