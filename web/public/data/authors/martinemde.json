Check if starship is installed (offers to install if missing)\n2. Detect existing configuration and ask what to do\n3. Ask about Nerd Font support\n4. Let you choose a color palette\n5. Let you choose a prompt style\n6. Install the script and generate your config\n7. Update your Claude Code settings\n8. Verify everything works\n\n## Manual Install\n\nYou'll need [starship](https://starship.rs/#quick-install) to render the statusline:\n\n```bash\n# If you don't already have starship...\ncurl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh\n\n```\n\nYou'll probably want a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (optional) for the robot icons.\n\nWhen you're ready to install, run these in your terminal (not in claude):\n\n```bash\n# Download the script from this repository\nmkdir -p ~/.local/bin\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinemde/starship-claude/main/plugin/bin/starship-claude \\\n  -o ~/.local/bin/starship-claude && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/starship-claude\n\n# Get the config file that you can customize\nmkdir -p ~/.claude\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinemde/starship-claude/main/plugin/templates/minimal-nerd.toml \\\n  -o ~/.claude/starship.toml\n```\n\nAdd the statusline in your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  // ... other stuff\n  \"statusLine\": {\n    \"type\": \"command\",\n    \"command\": \"~/.local/bin/starship-claude\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nRun it directly to test it out but you'll need to grab a [test fixture JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinemde/starship-claude/refs/heads/main/test/fixtures/low_cost_session.json).\n\n```sh\n./starship-claude < test/fixtures/low_cost_session.json\n```\n\n## My Favorite Feature: Context Window Progress Bar\n\nShow progress bars for context usage percentages in terminals like Ghostty. (I love it!)\n\nWe use [Dex Horthy's \"dumb zone\" (video)][dumb-zone] to start warning at 40%.\n\n- Progress bar scales for 80% compaction.\n  - 0-40%: Normal - You're good.\n  - 40-60%: Warning - Reset if it's not going well.\n  - 60%+: Error - Compacting soon...\n\nWarning does not mean stop, but be aware of your context usage.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This doesn't work in tmux even if you are using Ghostty.\n> Let me know if you find a workaround.\n\n[dumb-zone]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmvDxxNubIg 'YouTube: No Vibes Allowed: Solving Hard Problems in Complex Codebases – Dex Horthy, HumanLayer'\n\n### Customize\n\nAdd these options to the `~/.claude/settings.json` if you want do things differently.\n\n```sh\n# custom config file\nstarship-claude --config ~/.config/starship/claude.toml\n\n# disable terminal context progress bar (maybe it's printing weird characters?)\nstarship-claude --no-progress\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\nInstall BATS and run tests:\n\n```bash\n# Install BATS via mise\nmise use bats@latest\nmise install\n\n# Run all tests\nmise exec -- bats test/\n\n# Run specific test file\nmise exec -- bats test/model_extraction.bats\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License © 2026 Martin Emde\n",
