        "README.md": "# performance-optimization\n\nA Claude Code plugin that provides language-agnostic performance optimization guidance for C++, Rust, and TypeScript.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe content in this skill is distilled from Google's **[Abseil Performance Guide](https://abseil.io/fast/hints.html)** — specifically the *Performance Hints* page and the 25 *Fast Tips of the Week* articles (#7, #9, #21, #26, #39, #52, #53, #60, #62, #64, #70, #72, #74, #75, #79, #83, #87, #88, #90, #93, #94, #95, #97, #98, #99). All credit for the original ideas, techniques, case studies, and latency reference numbers belongs to the Abseil authors (Jeff Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Chris Kennelly, and contributors).\n\nThis plugin repackages that wisdom into a progressive-disclosure skill format suitable for Claude Code, with cross-language equivalents added for Rust and TypeScript.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace in Claude Code:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add timbrinded/performance-plugin\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install performance-optimization@timbrinded-performance-plugin\n```\n\nOr use the interactive plugin manager (`/plugin`) and browse the **Discover** tab to find and install it.\n\n## What it covers\n\n| Reference file | Topic |\n|----------------|-------|\n| `philosophy.md` | The critical 3%, performance-aware design, back-of-envelope estimation, latency numbers |\n| `measurement.md` | Profiling, microbenchmarking, hardware counters, measurement ROI |\n| `techniques-algorithms.md` | Algorithmic complexity, data structure selection, bulk APIs, regex |\n| `techniques-memory.md` | Compact structs, field layout, arenas, bit vectors, reducing indirections |\n| `techniques-execution.md` | Fast paths, precomputation, deferred work, specialization, caching |\n| `techniques-allocations.md` | Allocation reduction, copy avoidance, temporary reuse, object pooling |\n| `optimization-process.md` | Project selection, rollout strategy, automation, estimation calibration |\n| `language-equivalents.md` | C++ / Rust / TypeScript mapping table for all techniques |\n\n## When to use this\n\n**Good fit:**\n\n- \"This endpoint is slow, help me figure out why\" — the skill walks through measure-first methodology, helps pick the right profiling tool, and suggests technique categories based on what the profile reveals.\n- \"I need to pick between a HashMap and a BTreeMap for this lookup table\" — the algorithms reference has a data structure decision framework with language-specific recommendations.\n- \"Estimate whether this batch job can finish in under 10 minutes\" — the philosophy reference has latency numbers and back-of-envelope estimation techniques to sanity-check feasibility before writing code.\n- \"I'm about to optimize this hot loop, what should I think about\" — the process reference covers project selection, one-tradeoff-at-a-time rollouts, and reversibility thinking that prevents wasted effort.\n- \"Port this C++ optimization to Rust\" — the language equivalents table maps specific types and patterns (`InlinedVector` → `SmallVec`, `flat_hash_map` → `hashbrown`, arena → `bumpalo`).\n\n**Poor fit:**\n\n- **You need a specific profiling tutorial.** The skill explains *what* to measure and *why*, but does not walk through tool-specific steps like \"how to use `perf record` on this binary\" or \"how to read a Chrome DevTools flame chart.\" Use the tool's own documentation for that.\n- **You need domain-specific optimization.** Database query tuning, GPU shader optimization, ML model inference, network protocol optimization — these have their own bodies of knowledge that this skill does not cover.\n- **You are writing TypeScript and want memory layout control.** Roughly 20% of the techniques (cache line optimization, SoA/AoS, SIMD, compiler hints) do not apply to TypeScript at all. The skill marks these honestly as \"N/A\" but cannot compensate for the runtime not exposing those levers.\n- **You want a linter or automated checker.** This is reference material for a thinking agent, not a static analysis tool. It will not flag performance issues in code unprompted.\n\n## Known limitations\n\n**Condensed source material.** The original Abseil content spans 25+ detailed articles with rich case studies, production anecdotes, and nuanced discussion. This skill distills that into ~9,000 words of reference material. Some depth and context from the originals is inevitably lost — particularly the specific Google-scale examples that motivate each technique. When a recommendation here seems surprising or under-justified, read the original article at [abseil.io/fast](https://abseil.io/fast/hints.html) for the full reasoning.\n\n**Cross-language equivalents are best-effort.** The Abseil authors are C++ performance experts writing for C++ engineers. The Rust and TypeScript equivalents were added by translation, not by domain experts in those ecosystems. Most mappings are straightforward (`string_view` → `&str`, SwissTable → `hashbrown` which is literally the same algorithm), but edge cases or idiomatic alternatives may exist that are not captured here.\n\n**Static snapshot.** The Abseil performance guide is actively maintained (some articles were updated as recently as late 2025). This plugin is a point-in-time snapshot that will drift from the source. If a recommendation seems outdated, check the original.\n\n**Not tested in optimization workflows.** The skill has been structurally validated (correct frontmatter, progressive disclosure, writing style) but has not been pressure-tested in real optimization sessions. The decision tree routing and reference completeness may have gaps that only surface in practice.\n\n**Methodology-heavy, implementation-light.** The strongest content is the *process* wisdom — how to think about optimization, when to measure, how to structure rollouts. The technique references cover *what* to do but are lighter on *how* to implement it step by step. This is intentional (implementation details vary by codebase) but means the skill works better as a thinking framework than as a cookbook.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe skill triggers when you mention performance-related terms (\"optimize\", \"make faster\", \"slow code\", \"cache misses\", etc.). `SKILL.md` loads as a lean router (~930 words) with a decision tree that points to the appropriate reference file based on your problem. Reference files load on demand.\n\n## Structure\n\n```text\nperformance-skill/\n  .claude-plugin/\n    marketplace.json\n  plugins/\n    performance-optimization/\n      .claude-plugin/\n        plugin.json\n      skills/\n        performance/\n          SKILL.md\n          references/\n            philosophy.md\n            measurement.md\n            techniques-algorithms.md\n            techniques-memory.md\n            techniques-execution.md\n            techniques-allocations.md\n            optimization-process.md\n            language-equivalents.md\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe original Abseil content is published by Google under [its terms](https://abseil.io).

No slash command needed — just talk naturally:\n\n- \"Review this SwiftUI view for me\"\n- \"Is this code accessible?\"\n- \"Check for deprecated APIs\"\n- \"Generate a login screen\"\n- \"How should I add haptics to this view?\"\n\n### Agent: swift-design-reviewer\n\nThe `swift-design-reviewer` agent triggers proactively when Claude detects you're reviewing or discussing SwiftUI code quality. It runs as an autonomous subprocess with read-only access (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`) and returns a structured review.\n\nYou can also invoke it explicitly by asking Claude to use the reviewer agent.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nCreate a settings file at `.claude/swift-design.local.md` in your project root (or `~/.claude/swift-design.local.md` globally) to customize behavior:\n\n```yaml\n---\nios-target: 17\nstrictness: standard\n---\n```\n\n### ios-target\n\nControls which rules apply and at what severity.\n\n| Value | Effect |\n|-------|--------|\n| `16` | `@Observable` (M2) and Tab API (M3) become suggestions.

        "plugins/performance-optimization/README.md": "# performance-optimization\n\nA Claude Code plugin that encodes language-agnostic performance optimization knowledge distilled from Google's Abseil performance engineering wisdom. Covers measurement methodology, optimization techniques across 4 categories, and cross-language patterns for C++, Rust, and TypeScript.\n\n## What it does\n\nThe plugin activates automatically when you ask to optimize, profile, benchmark, or discuss performance. It provides structured guidance through a decision tree that routes to the right technique based on the bottleneck type.\n\n| Bottleneck | Reference | Techniques |\n|------------|-----------|------------|\n| Wrong algorithm | `techniques-algorithms.md` | Complexity reduction, data structure selection, bulk APIs, regex optimization |\n| Memory layout | `techniques-memory.md` | Compact structs, field reordering, indices vs. pointers, arenas, bit vectors |\n| Unnecessary work | `techniques-execution.md` | Fast paths, precomputation, deferred computation, specialization, caching |\n| Too many allocations | `techniques-allocations.md` | Reserve/resize, move vs. copy, reuse temporaries, object pooling |\n| Need to measure | `measurement.md` | Profiling methodology, flat profiles, microbenchmarking, hardware counters |\n| Process questions | `optimization-process.md` | Project selection, success metrics, reversibility, rollout strategy |\n| Cross-language | `language-equivalents.md` | C++ → Rust → TypeScript mapping for all techniques |\n\n### Expected impact by category\n\n| Category | Typical Impact |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Algorithm/data structure | 10–1000x |\n| Memory representation | 2–10x |\n| Avoid unnecessary work | 2–20x |\n| Reduce allocations | 1.2–5x |\n| Bulk APIs | 2–10x |\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### From the Kiln marketplace (recommended)\n\nIn the Claude Code interactive terminal:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/timbrinded/kiln.git\n/plugin install performance-optimization@kiln\n```\n\n### Test without installing\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/kiln/plugins/performance-optimization\n```\n\n### Verify installation\n\nThe `performance-optimization` skill activates automatically when relevant — no slash command needed. Just talk naturally:\n\n- \"This function is too slow\"\n- \"Optimize this loop\"\n- \"Profile memory usage\"\n- \"What data structure should I use here?\"\n- \"Reduce allocations in this hot path\"\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nThe skill uses **progressive disclosure** — only the relevant reference files are loaded based on the bottleneck type, keeping context window cost low.\n\n### Optimization workflow\n\n```\n1. MEASURE  →  2. IDENTIFY  →  3. OPTIMIZE  →  4.
