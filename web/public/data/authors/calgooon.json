        "README.md": "# x402\n\nClaude Code skill for BSV micropayments. Discover, authenticate, and pay AI services with Bitcoin SV — all from natural language.\n\n## What It Does\n\nSay what you want. The skill handles the rest:\n\n```\n/x402 generate an image of a mountain sunset\n/x402 transcribe this audio file\n/x402 search twitter for AI agent discussions\n/x402 upload this file to NanoStore for a year\n```\n\nUnder the hood:\n\n1. **Discovers** available services from the [x402agency.com](https://x402agency.com) agent directory\n2. **Authenticates** with [BRC-31](https://brc.dev/31) mutual auth (automatic handshake + session caching)\n3. **Pays** with [BRC-29](https://brc.dev/29) micropayments (automatic 402 handling, transaction creation)\n4. **Refunds** automatically if a paid request fails — the refund is internalized to your wallet with no manual steps\n\n## Available Services\n\nThe skill discovers agents from [x402agency.com/.well-known/agents](https://x402agency.com/.well-known/agents):\n\n| Agent | What it does | Cost |\n|:------|:-------------|:-----|\n| **Banana Agent** | AI image generation (Google Nano Banana Pro) | ~$0.19/image |\n| **Veo Agent** | AI video generation with audio (Google Veo 3.1 Fast) | ~$0.75–$1.50/clip |\n| **Whisper Agent** | Speech-to-text transcription (Whisper Large v3 Turbo) | ~$0.0006/min |\n| **X Research Agent** | Twitter/X search, profiles, threads, trending | ~$0.005–$0.06/req |\n| **1Sat Agent** | 1Sat Ordinals inscriptions (any file type) | 200–256,000 sats |\n| **NanoStore** | File hosting with UHRP content addressing (Babbage) | ~$0.0004/MB/yr |\n\nThird-party services like NanoStore are listed in the directory with hosted manifests — clients connect directly, no proxy.\n\n## Install\n\nRequires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [MetaNet Client](https://getmetanet.com).\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add calgooon/x402\n/plugin install x402@calgooon-x402\n```\n\n> **Troubleshooting:** If you get a \"Failed to finalize marketplace cache\" error, run `/plugin`, select **Manage marketplaces > Add marketplace**, and paste `https://github.com/Calgooon/x402`. Then run `/plugin install x402@calgooon-x402`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **MetaNet Client** running at `localhost:3321` (download from [getmetanet.com](https://getmetanet.com))\n- **Python 3** with `requests` (`pip install requests`)\n\n## Usage\n\nThe `/x402` command is the entry point. You can use it conversationally or with specific commands:\n\n### Natural language\n```\n/x402 generate a photo of a cat in a top hat\n/x402 upload report.pdf to NanoStore for 1 year\n/x402 search twitter for \"bitcoin scaling\" from the last 24 hours\n/x402 transcribe meeting.wav\n```\n\n### Specific commands\n```\n/x402 list                              # List all agents in the directory\n/x402 discover banana                   # Show endpoints, pricing, schemas for an agent\n/x402 discover nanostore                # Works for third-party services too\n/x402 auth GET nanostore/list           # Authenticated request (no payment)\n/x402 pay POST banana/generate {\"prompt\":\"a sunset\"}  # Paid request\n```\n\n### Command reference\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|:--------|:-------------|\n| `/x402 list` | List all registered agents with capabilities and pricing |\n| `/x402 discover <agent>` | Fetch the x402-info manifest — endpoints, schemas, pricing, error codes |\n| `/x402 auth <METHOD> <agent/path>` | Make a BRC-31 authenticated request (no payment) |\n| `/x402 pay <METHOD> <agent/path> [body]` | Make an authenticated + paid request (auto-handles 402 flow) |\n| `/x402 identity` | Show your wallet's identity key |\n| `/x402 session <url>` | Inspect a cached BRC-31 session |\n\nAgent names (`banana`, `nanostore`, `whisper`, etc.) resolve automatically. Full URLs work too.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Generate an image\n```\n/x402 generate a photo of a cat wearing a top hat\n→ discovers banana agent, pays ~9,000 sats, returns image URL\n```\n\n### Upload a file\n```\n/x402 upload report.pdf to NanoStore for 1 year\n→ discovers NanoStore, pays ~730 sats for 1MB/year, returns presigned upload URL\n```\n\n### Search Twitter\n```\n/x402 find tweets about bitcoin scaling from the last 24 hours\n→ discovers x-research agent, pays ~3,000 sats, returns sorted results\n```\n\n### Transcribe audio\n```\n/x402 transcribe meeting.wav\n→ discovers whisper agent, pays based on audio length, returns text\n```\n\n### Inscribe an image as a 1Sat Ordinal\n```\n/x402 inscribe this image as an ordinal\n→ discovers 1sat-agent, pays service fee, builds script, wallet broadcasts, returns txid\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\n/x402 <user request>\n  → skill runs `list` to find matching agent by capabilities\n  → skill runs `discover <agent>` to read the x402-info manifest\n  → skill reads endpoint schemas, pricing, auth requirements\n  → skill runs `pay POST <agent>/<endpoint> '{...}'`\n    → BRC-31 handshake (automatic, cached 1 hour)\n    → initial request → server returns 402 with price\n    → wallet creates payment transaction\n    → retry with x-bsv-payment header → server accepts, returns result\n  → skill presents result to user\n```\n\nAll payment is automatic — no confirmation prompts for typical micropayments (1–100,000 sats).\n\n## Agent Directory\n\nThe skill resolves short names (like `banana` or `nanostore`) to full URLs via the [x402agency.com](https://x402agency.com) registry. Any BRC-31/BRC-29 service can be listed — including third-party services that don't serve their own discovery manifest.\n\nThe registry is cached locally for 5 minutes. Full URLs (`https://...`) bypass the registry entirely.\n\n## Protocol\n\n- **[BRC-31](https://brc.dev/31)**: Mutual HTTP authentication with identity keys and signed requests\n- **[BRC-29](https://brc.dev/29)**: HTTP micropayments via 402 Payment Required flow\n- **[BRC-100](https://brc.dev/100)**: MetaNet Client wallet interface (key derivation, signing, transaction creation)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
