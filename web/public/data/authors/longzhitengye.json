        "plugins/git-commands/README.md": "# Commit Commands Plugin\n\nStreamline your git workflow with simple commands for committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Commit Commands Plugin automates common git operations, reducing context switching and manual command execution. Instead of running multiple git commands, use a single slash command to handle your entire workflow.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/commit`\n\nCreates a git commit with an automatically generated commit message based on staged and unstaged changes.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. Analyzes current git status\n2. Reviews both staged and unstaged changes\n3. Examines recent commit messages to match your repository's style\n4. Drafts an appropriate commit message\n5. Stages relevant files\n6. Creates the commit\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n/commit\n```\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Make some changes to your code\n# Then simply run:\n/commit\n\n# Claude will:\n# - Review your changes\n# - Stage the files\n# - Create a commit with an appropriate message\n# - Show you the commit status\n```\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Automatically drafts commit messages that match your repo's style\n- Follows conventional commit practices\n- Avoids committing files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)\n- Includes Claude Code attribution in commit message\n\n### `/commit-push-pr`\n\nComplete workflow command that commits, pushes, and creates a pull request in one step.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. Creates a new branch (if currently on main)\n2. Stages and commits changes with an appropriate message\n3. Pushes the branch to origin\n4. Creates a pull request using `gh pr create`\n5. Provides the PR URL\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n/commit-push-pr\n```\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Make your changes\n# Then run:\n/commit-push-pr\n\n# Claude will:\n# - Create a feature branch (if needed)\n# - Commit your changes\n# - Push to remote\n# - Open a PR with summary and test plan\n# - Give you the PR URL to review\n```\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Analyzes all commits in the branch (not just the latest)\n- Creates comprehensive PR descriptions with:\n  - Summary of changes (1-3 bullet points)\n  - Test plan checklist\n  - Claude Code attribution\n- Handles branch creation automatically\n- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated\n- Repository must have a remote named `origin`\n\n### `/clean_gone`\n\nCleans up local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. Lists all local branches to identify [gone] status\n2. Identifies and removes worktrees associated with [gone] branches\n3. Deletes all branches marked as [gone]\n4. Provides feedback on removed branches\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n/clean_gone\n```\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# After PRs are merged and remote branches are deleted\n/clean_gone\n\n# Claude will:\n# - Find all branches marked as [gone]\n# - Remove any associated worktrees\n# - Delete the stale local branches\n# - Report what was cleaned up\n```\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Handles both regular branches and worktree branches\n- Safely removes worktrees before deleting branches\n- Shows clear feedback about what was removed\n- Reports if no cleanup was needed\n\n**When to use:**\n\n- After merging and deleting remote branches\n- When your local branch list is cluttered with stale branches\n- During regular repository maintenance\n\n## Installation\n\nThis plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The commands are automatically available when using Claude Code.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Using `/commit`\n\n- Review the staged changes before committing\n- Let Claude analyze your changes and match your repo's commit style\n- Trust the automated message, but verify it's accurate\n- Use for routine commits during development\n\n### Using `/commit-push-pr`\n\n- Use when you're ready to create a PR\n- Ensure all your changes are complete and tested\n- Claude will analyze the full branch history for the PR description\n- Review the PR description and edit if needed\n- Use when you want to minimize context switching\n\n### Using `/clean_gone`\n\n- Run periodically to keep your branch list clean\n- Especially useful after merging multiple PRs\n- Safe to run - only removes branches already deleted remotely\n- Helps maintain a tidy local repository\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\n### Quick commit workflow\n\n```bash\n# Write code\n/commit\n# Continue development\n```\n\n### Feature branch workflow\n\n```bash\n# Develop feature across multiple commits\n/commit  # First commit\n# More changes\n/commit  # Second commit\n# Ready to create PR\n/commit-push-pr\n```\n\n### Maintenance workflow\n\n```bash\n# After several PRs are merged\n/clean_gone\n# Clean workspace ready for next feature\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Git must be installed and configured\n- For `/commit-push-pr`: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated\n- Repository must be a git repository with a remote\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### `/commit` creates empty commit\n\n**Issue**: No changes to commit\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- Ensure you have unstaged or staged changes\n- Run `git status` to verify changes exist\n\n### `/commit-push-pr` fails to create PR\n\n**Issue**: `gh pr create` command fails\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)\n- Authenticate: `gh auth login`\n- Ensure repository has a GitHub remote\n\n### `/clean_gone` doesn't find branches\n\n**Issue**: No branches marked as [gone]\n\n**Solution**:\n\n- Run `git fetch --prune` to update remote tracking\n- Branches must be deleted from the remote to show as [gone]\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Combine with other tools**: Use `/commit` during development, then `/commit-push-pr` when ready\n- **Let Claude draft messages**: The commit message analysis learns from your repo's style\n- **Regular cleanup**: Run `/clean_gone` weekly to maintain a clean branch list\n- **Review before pushing**: Always review the commit message and changes before pushing\n\n## Author\n\nAnthropic (<support@anthropic.com>)\n\n## Version\n\n1.0.0\n"
