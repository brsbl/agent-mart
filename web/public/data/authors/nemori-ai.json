        "README.md": "# Meta-Skills Collection\n\nA collection of meta-skills for Claude that enhance skill creation and customization workflows.\n\n## What are Meta-Skills?\n\nMeta-skills are skills that help you create or improve other skills. This collection provides powerful tools for:\n\n- **Creating new skills** from MCP servers with workflow optimizations\n- **Customizing existing skills** to match your preferences and requirements\n- **Iteratively improving skills** based on real-world usage\n\n## Skills in This Collection\n\n### 🔧 mcp-skill-creator\n\nTransform MCP servers into workflow-optimized skills following [Anthropic's MCP + Code Execution best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp).\n\n**Use when you want to:**\n- Create a custom skill from one or more MCP servers\n- Optimize workflows with parallel execution and data filtering\n- Build reusable automation scripts for specific work scenarios\n- Capture personal SOPs and preferences into a skill\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load tool definitions on-demand (98.7% token savings)\n- **Working Code Generation**: Generates actual working MCP client infrastructure\n- **Context Efficiency**: Process data in execution environment\n- **Personalization**: Embed user preferences and SOPs into workflow\n\n**Example:**\n```\n\"I search files with priority: Projects → Downloads → Tmp, stop when found\"\n```\n→ Generates a skill with prioritized search workflow and embedded preferences\n\n[See detailed documentation →](mcp-skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n\n---\n\n### ✨ skill-customizer\n\nFork and iteratively improve existing skills based on your specific preferences and workflows.\n\n**Use when you want to:**\n- Customize an existing skill's output format or behavior\n- Adapt a skill to company-specific requirements\n- Add domain-specific knowledge to an existing skill\n- Fine-tune a skill based on real-world usage\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Systematic Forking**: Copy and track skill customizations\n- **Structured Feedback**: Capture what works and what doesn't\n- **Guided Customization**: Modify behaviors, scripts, and references\n- **Version Control**: Timestamped packaging for distribution\n\n**Example:**\n```\n\"I want the pdf skill to always output tables as CSV instead of JSON\"\n```\n→ Forks and customizes the pdf skill with your preferences\n\n[See detailed documentation →](skill-customizer/SKILL.md)\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Via Claude Code Marketplace\n\n```bash\n# Add this repository as a marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nemori-ai/skills.git\n\n# Browse and install plugins\n# Then select \"Browse and install plugins\" → Choose skill → \"Install now\"\n```\n\n### Available Plugins\n\n- **mcp-skill-creator** - Create workflow-optimized skills from MCP servers\n- **skill-customizer** - Customize existing skills based on preferences\n\n## Quick Start Examples\n\n### Creating a New MCP-Powered Skill\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install MCP SDK\npip3 install mcp --break-system-packages\n\n# 2. Use mcp-skill-creator\n\"I want to create a skill that searches my Projects, Downloads, and Tmp\ndirectories with priority order, stopping when files are found\"\n```\n\n### Customizing an Existing Skill\n\n```bash\n# Use skill-customizer\n\"I want to customize the data-analysis skill to always include\nconfidence intervals and use my company's data visualization standards\"\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### For mcp-skill-creator\n- Python 3.10+\n- MCP SDK: `pip3 install mcp --break-system-packages`\n- Node.js (for running MCP servers via npx)\n\n### For skill-customizer\n- Python 3.10+\n\n## Documentation\n\nEach skill has detailed documentation in its directory:\n\n- [mcp-skill-creator/SKILL.md](mcp-skill-creator/SKILL.md) - Complete workflow for creating MCP-powered skills\n- [mcp-skill-creator/references/](mcp-skill-creator/references/) - MCP best practices and examples\n- [skill-customizer/SKILL.md](skill-customizer/SKILL.md) - Complete workflow for customizing skills\n- [skill-customizer/references/](skill-customizer/references/) - Customization patterns and examples\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks.
