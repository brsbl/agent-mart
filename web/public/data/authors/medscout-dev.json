        "plugin/README.md": "# DDX Plugin for Claude Code\n\nMCP plugin that connects Claude Code and Claude Desktop to MedScout's DDX platform — Voice of Customer (VOC) and Go-to-Market (GTM) account research.\n\n## Setup\n\n### 1. Get Your API Token\n\n1. Log into DDX at `https://ddx.medscout.io`\n2. Visit **[/settings/mcp/](https://ddx.medscout.io/settings/mcp/)** — your token is auto-created\n3. Copy the token\n\n### 2. Set the Token\n\nAdd to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):\n\n```bash\nexport DDX_API_TOKEN=\"<your-token>\"\n```\n\nThen reload your shell (`source ~/.zshrc`) or open a new terminal.\n\n### 3. Connect\n\n**Claude Code:**\n```\n/plugin marketplace add medscout-dev/ddx-claude-plugin\n/plugin install ddx@medscout\n```\n\n**Claude Desktop:**\nCopy the JSON config from the [setup page](https://ddx.medscout.io/settings/mcp/) into your `claude_desktop_config.json`.\n\n## What You Get\n\n| Feature | Claude Code | Claude Desktop |\n|---------|:-----------:|:--------------:|\n| 21 MCP tools | Yes | Yes |\n| 7 resources | Yes | Yes |\n| 5 prompts | Yes | Yes |\n| 7 skills (`/submit-voc`, etc.) | Yes | No |\n| VOC Analyst agent | Yes | No |\n| GTM Research Analyst agent | Yes | No |\n\n## Available Skills\n\nSkills are guided workflows you trigger with slash commands in Claude Code.\n\n### VOC Skills\n| Skill | What it Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/submit-voc` | Gathers details, searches for duplicates, then creates or matches to an existing VOC item |\n| `/analyze-feedback` | Paste meeting notes, transcripts, or emails — extracts structured VOC items with duplicate matching |\n| `/voc-search` | Search items, browse themes, analyze trends, query transcripts, view company feedback history |\n| `/merge-voc` | Merge two VOC items — AI-suggested content, target recommendation, full relationship transfer |\n\n### Platform Skills\n| Skill | What it Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/feedback` | Submit feedback or a bug report about DDX directly to the #feedback-ddx Slack channel |\n\n### GTM Skills\n| Skill | What it Does |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/research-search` | Search research packs, read report content, check request status |\n| `/generate-research` | End-to-end research generation: transcripts → reports → published pack → completed request |\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### VOC Management\n- `search_voc_items` — Keyword search across title, description, and problem statement\n- `find_similar_voc_items` — Semantic similarity search via AI embeddings\n- `get_voc_item` — Full item details with companies, themes, tags, and comments\n- `create_voc_item` — Create a new VOC item (auto-generates embeddings)\n- `add_company_to_voc_item` — Associate a company with priority and context\n- `add_attachment_to_voc_item` — Upload a file (image, PDF, etc.) to a VOC item from a URL\n- `search_companies` — Find companies by name, filter by health status\n\n### Analytics\n- `list_themes` — Browse themes with business metrics (ARR, company count, health)\n- `get_theme_details` — Deep dive into a theme with items, companies, sub-themes\n- `get_voc_analytics` — Flexible analytics: group by theme/company/status/tag, compare periods, semantic filter\n\n### Transcripts\n- `query_transcripts` — Filter transcripts by company, team, date; keyword search across full text\n- `search_transcripts_semantic` — Find transcripts by meaning using AI embeddings\n\n### Bulk Processing\n- `parse_feedback` — Parse unstructured text into structured VOC proposals with automatic deduplication\n\n### Platform Feedback\n- `submit_platform_feedback` — Post feedback or bug reports about DDX to #feedback-ddx Slack channel\n\n### VOC Merge\n- `suggest_merge` — AI-suggested merge content with target recommendation and relationship preview\n- `execute_merge` — Execute the merge with full relationship transfer (companies, themes, tags, features, attachments, comments, mentions)\n\n### GTM Research\n- `list_research_packs` — List research packs with company and report summaries\n- `get_research_report` — Get full report content (fingerprint, AE briefing, CS briefing, full pack)\n- `publish_research_pack` — Create or update a research pack with reports\n- `list_research_requests` — List pending/submitted research requests\n- `complete_research_request` — Mark a request as completed and link to a pack\n\n## Agents\n\n### VOC Analyst\nAutonomous agent that answers product strategy questions using real customer data. Automatically selects the right tools, gathers data across multiple dimensions, and synthesizes findings into actionable insights with specific numbers (ARR, company count, health status).\n\nTriggered automatically when you ask broad product questions like:\n- \"What are customers most frustrated about?\"\n- \"Which themes have the highest at-risk ARR?\"\n- \"Compare CS vs Sales feedback themes\"\n\n### GTM Research Analyst\nAutonomous agent that generates account intelligence from call transcripts and company data. Processes research requests end-to-end: gathers transcript intelligence, generates reports, publishes packs, and completes requests with Slack notifications.\n\nTriggered automatically when you ask about account research:\n- \"Generate research for Acme Corp\"\n- \"What research requests are pending?\"\n- \"Show me the latest research packs\"\n- \"Process the next pending research request\"\n\n## Example Queries\n\nYou can ask questions in natural language — no slash commands required:\n\n```\n\"What are the top VOC themes by ARR?\"\n\"Search for items about profile usability\"\n\"What has Acme Corp requested?\"\n\"Show me the fingerprint for acme-corp\"\n\"What research requests are pending?\"\n\"Generate research for company XYZ\"\n\"What calls mentioned data exports this month?\"\n\"Parse this meeting notes into VOC items: ...\"\n\"Merge VOC items 123 and 456\"\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe plugin connects to DDX's MCP server at `https://ddx.medscout.io/mcp` using Streamable HTTP transport. Your `DDX_API_TOKEN` is sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The MCP server runs inside Django, accessing the same database as the DDX web app — so data is always live and consistent.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"Missing or malformed Authorization header\" (401)**\n- Check that `DDX_API_TOKEN` is set: `echo $DDX_API_TOKEN`\n- Reload your shell after adding it to `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`\n\n**\"Invalid or inactive API token\" (401)**\n- Your token may have been regenerated. Visit [/settings/mcp/](https://ddx.medscout.io/settings/mcp/) to get your current token.\n\n**Plugin not finding tools**\n- Verify the plugin is installed: `claude plugin list`\n- Reinstall if needed: `claude plugin remove ddx` then `/plugin install ddx@medscout`\n\n**CI/scripting environments (no browser)**\n- For headless environments, use a static API token instead:\n  ```bash\n  claude mcp add --transport http ddx https://ddx.medscout.io/mcp \\\n    --header \"Authorization: Bearer <your-token>\"\n  ```\n- Get your token from [/settings/mcp/](https://ddx.medscout.io/settings/mcp/)\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nplugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json         # Plugin metadata (name, version, author)\n├── .mcp.json               # MCP server connection config (HTTP URL + auth)\n├── skills/\n│   ├── submit-voc/         # /submit-voc skill\n│   ├── analyze-feedback/   # /analyze-feedback skill\n│   ├── voc-search/         # /voc-search skill\n│   ├── merge-voc/          # /merge-voc skill\n│   ├── feedback/           # /feedback skill\n│   ├── research-search/    # /research-search skill\n│   └── generate-research/  # /generate-research skill\n├── agents/\n│   ├── voc-analyst.md      # VOC Analyst autonomous agent\n│   └── gtm-research-analyst.md  # GTM Research Analyst autonomous agent\n└── README.md               # This file\n```\n\nThe `.mcp.json` points to the production MCP server.

        "README.md": "# Compound Flow\n\nStack-adaptive workflow automation plugin for Claude Code. A streamlined fork of [compound-engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) with smart review scaling, token-optimized review pipelines, and per-project stack detection.\n\n**19 agents, 16 commands, 11 skills** for code review, research, and workflow automation.\n\n## Supported Stacks\n\n| Stack | Auto-detected by | Review Agents |\n|-------|------------------|---------------|\n| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` | `kieran-python-reviewer` + general |\n| TypeScript/React | `tsconfig.json`, `package.json` with react/next | `kieran-typescript-reviewer` + `frontend-reviewer` + general |\n| Alpine.js | `package.json` with alpinejs | `kieran-typescript-reviewer` + `frontend-reviewer` + general |\n| Fullstack | Both Python and frontend files detected | All language reviewers + general |\n| General | No specific stack detected | `code-simplicity-reviewer` + `security-sentinel` + `performance-oracle` + `architecture-strategist` |\n\nStack is detected on first run and saved to `compound-flow.local.md`. Re-run setup anytime to reconfigure.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace (one time)\n/plugin marketplace add medscout-dev/compound-flow\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install compound-flow@compound-flow\n```\n\nOr from a local path:\n```bash\nclaude /install-plugin /path/to/compound-flow/plugin\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**First time in a project:** Run any workflow command — the setup skill auto-triggers if no config exists, detects your stack, and writes `compound-flow.local.md`.\n\n**Daily workflow:**\n1. `/workflows:brainstorm` → Explore requirements through dialogue\n2. `/workflows:plan` → Create a structured implementation plan\n3. `/workflows:work docs/plans/plan.md` → Execute the plan, create PR\n4. `/workflows:review` → Multi-agent code review with token-optimized pipeline\n5. `/workflows:compound` → Document what you learned\n\n**Shortcuts:**\n- Quick feature: `/workflows:plan` → `/workflows:work`\n- PR review only: `/workflows:review 123`\n- Bug fix: `/reproduce-bug` → fix → `/workflows:review`\n- Knowledge bootstrap: `/initialize-knowledge` (once per project)\n- Migrating from compound-engineering: `/migrate-solutions` (once per project)\n\n## Philosophy: Compounding Engineering\n\nEach unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier — not harder.\n\nThe plugin implements a **Plan → Build → Review → Compound** workflow loop:\n1. **Brainstorm** → Explore requirements through dialogue\n2. **Plan** → Transform ideas into structured implementation plans\n3. **Work** → Execute plans with quality gates\n4. **Review** → Multi-agent code review with smart scaling\n5. **Compound** → Document what you learned for next time\n\n## Agents (19)\n\n### Review (10)\n\n| Agent | Description

(4)\n\n| Agent | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `bug-reproduction-validator` | Systematically reproduces and validates bug reports |\n| `spec-flow-analyzer` | Analyzes specs for user flow completeness and gap identification |\n| `pr-comment-resolver` | Addresses PR review comments with code changes |\n| `lint` | Runs linting and code quality checks |\n\n## Commands (16)\n\n### Workflow Commands (5)\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/workflows:brainstorm` | Explore requirements and approaches through collaborative dialogue |\n| `/workflows:plan` | Transform feature descriptions into structured project plans |\n| `/workflows:work` | Execute work plans efficiently while maintaining quality |\n| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review with smart scaling by PR complexity |\n| `/workflows:compound` | Document a recently solved problem for team knowledge |\n\n### Utility Commands (11)\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/initialize-knowledge` | Bootstrap compounded knowledge by mining merged PRs for architectural decisions, bug fixes, and patterns |\n| `/deepen-plan` | Enhance a plan with parallel research agents |\n| `/triage` | Triage issues and bugs |\n| `/resolve_parallel` | Resolve items in parallel |\n| `/resolve_todo_parallel` | Resolve all pending CLI todos in parallel |\n| `/report-bug` | Report a bug with structured information |\n| `/reproduce-bug` | Reproduce a reported bug systematically |\n| `/generate_command` | Generate a new command template |\n| `/heal-skill` | Diagnose and fix a broken skill |\n| `/test-browser` | Run browser tests on pages affected by current PR |\n| `/migrate-solutions` | Migrate docs/solutions/ YAML frontmatter from compound-engineering to compound-flow enum values |\n\n## Skills (11)\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `orchestrating-swarms` | Coordinate multi-agent workflows with parallel execution |\n| `compound-docs` | Document solved problems to compound team knowledge |\n| `brainstorming` | Structured brainstorming before implementation |\n| `agent-native-architecture` | Build applications where agents are first-class citizens |\n| `git-worktree` | Manage Git worktrees for isolated parallel development |\n| `file-todos` | Track and resolve file-level TODOs |\n| `resolve-pr-parallel` | Resolve PR comments in

Expert guidance for creating skills and commands |\n| `skill-creator` | Create new skills from templates |\n\n## Knowledge Initialization\n\nRun `/initialize-knowledge` after installing the plugin to bootstrap your compounded knowledge from existing work. The command:\n\n1. **Scans all merged PRs** via GitHub CLI\n2. **Filters for meaningful learnings** — architectural decisions, bug fixes with root causes, integration gotchas, pattern changes. Skips typos, README edits, version bumps, and trivial changes.\n3. **Analyzes in parallel** — batches PRs and uses parallel agents to extract decisions, patterns, and lessons learned\n4. **Presents candidates for approval** — you review each candidate before it's written\n5. **Writes approved docs** to `docs/solutions/` in the compound-docs format with full YAML frontmatter\n\nThis solves the cold start problem: instead of waiting weeks for knowledge to accumulate through `/workflows:compound`, you get immediate value from your team's existing work.\n\n## Auto-Parallel Execution\n\nThe `/workflows:work` command automatically detects when parallel execution would be faster. After creating the todo list, it analyzes:\n\n- **Independent task count** — tasks with no dependencies\n- **Specialist diversity** — whether tasks need different agent types\n- **File isolation** — whether tasks touch different modules\n\n| Condition | Mode |\n|-----------|------|\n| 5+ independent tasks | Auto-swarm |\n| 3+ independent tasks with different specialists or modules | Auto-swarm |\n| Everything else | Standard sequential |\n\nOverride: say \"use swarm mode\" to force parallel, or \"no swarm\" for sequential.\n\n## Smart Review Scaling\n\nThe `/workflows:review` command scales agent count to PR complexity:\n\n| Tier | Criteria | Agents |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| SMALL | <5 files, <100 lines | Stack reviewer + `code-simplicity-reviewer` only |\n| MEDIUM | 5-15 files, 100-500 lines | All agents from settings file |\n| LARGE | >15 files OR >500 lines OR touches security/DB | All settings agents + `learnings-researcher` + `architecture-strategist` |\n\nOverride with \"full review\" to run all agents regardless of PR size.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
