        "marketing-skills/skills/brand-voice/SKILL.md": "---\nname: brand-voice\ndescription: Defines and maintains consistent brand communication across all marketing materials. This skill should be used when creating new marketing content, auditing existing materials for voice consistency, onboarding team members to brand guidelines, or when content sounds generic or \"off-brand.\"\n---\n\n# Brand Voice\n\nThis skill creates distinctive, consistent brand voice guidelines that ensure every piece of marketing content sounds authentically like the brand - not generic AI output.\n\n## Objective\n\nDefine a memorable brand voice that differentiates from competitors and resonates with the target audience, then apply it consistently across all marketing touchpoints.\n\n## Intake Questions\n\nBefore defining or applying brand voice, gather this context:\n\n1. **Existing materials**: Are there any current brand guidelines, previous marketing pieces, or content that represents the desired voice?\n2. **Industry/category**: What space does the brand operate in? What do competitors sound like?\n3. **Target audience**: Who is the brand speaking to? What's their sophistication level, pain points, aspirations?\n4. **Brand personality**: If the brand were a person, how would they act at a party? Formal speaker? Witty friend? Wise mentor?\n5. **Differentiators**: What makes this brand different from every other option?\n\n## The Human Content Principle\n\nTo ensure your brand voice doesn't sound like generic AI, follow Adrian's core principle: **Say something a reasonable person could disagree with.**\n\n### Checklist for Human and Useful Content\n\nUse these guidelines to inject humanity into every piece of content:\n\n1. **Human-Led Outlines**: Start with an outline generated by a human who deeply understands the audience and topic. Ensure it has a clear narrative arc before writing.\n2. **The \"Un-AI\" Element**: Include 1-3 key statements that AI would be unlikely to generate (humor, strong opinion, controversy, or even minor vulgarity if the brand allows).\n3. **Radical Specificity**: Be rigorous about backing up every point with specific examples, data, or real-world scenarios. Specificity kills generic AI vibes.\n4. **No Em-Dashes**: Never use em-dashes (-) or en-dashes (-) in any content. Use hyphens (-) or other punctuation like colons or parentheses instead.\n5. **Avoid Verbal Cliches**: If the topic is being discussed the same way everyone else is talking about it, start over. Be different.\n6. **The Rewriting Step**: If using AI for first drafts, go back and manually rewrite sentences sprinkled throughout to match the voice perfectly.\n7. **Visual & Textual Pop**: Identify the 2-3 most important ideas. Ensure the text fully develops them and they are visually emphasized (bolding, spacing, or headings).\n\n## The Four Voice Dimensions\n\nScore the brand on each dimension (1-5 scale) to create a voice profile:\n\n### 1.

Conversational, punchy\n- **Format**: Text, images, threads, polls\n- **Best for**: Ideas, insights, engagement\n- **Hook**: First line must stop the scroll\n\n### LinkedIn\n- **Length**: Up to 3,000 characters\n- **Tone**: Professional but human, relatable, and opinionated\n- **Format**: Text posts, carousels, articles, video\n- **Best for**: B2B, thought leadership, career content, personal branding\n- **Hook**: First 2 lines are critical before \"...see more\"\n- **Timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11 AM (audience's time zone)\n- **Links**: Place external links in the first comment, not the post body, to avoid algorithm penalties\n\n### Instagram\n- **Length**: 2,200 characters (but shorter better)\n- **Tone**: Visual-first, casual, authentic\n- **Format**: Feed posts, carousels, Reels, Stories\n- **Best for**: Visual content, personal brands, how-tos\n- **Hook**: Strong first slide/frame\n\n### YouTube\n- **Length**: Varies (Shorts: 60s, Long-form: 10-20min optimal)\n- **Tone**: Energetic, valuable, entertaining\n- **Format**: Long-form, Shorts, Community posts\n- **Best for**: Tutorials, entertainment, deep dives\n- **Hook**: First 30 seconds critical\n\n### TikTok\n- **Length**: Up to 10 minutes (but 15-60s performs best)\n- **Tone**: Authentic, entertaining, trend-aware\n- **Format**: Short videos, duets, stitches\n- **Best for**: Younger audiences, entertainment, trends\n- **Hook**: First 1-3 seconds critical\n\n### Email\n- **Length**: 200-500 words typically\n- **Tone**: Personal, direct, valuable\n- **Format**: Newsletter sections, standalone emails\n- **Best for**: Deeper engagement, conversions\n- **Hook**: Subject line + first line\n\n## Viral LinkedIn Post Framework (2025)\n\nWhen repurposing content for LinkedIn, follow this proven structure for maximum reach:\n\n### 1. The Scroll-Stopping Hook\nThe first 2 lines must earn the click on \"...see more\".\n- **Stat/Data**: Start with a surprising number.\n- **Bold Opinion**: Challenge common wisdom in your niche.\n- **Personal Moment**: Share a vulnerable or relatable struggle.\n- **Unexpected Twist**: Start with a premise and flip it immediately.\n- **Avoid**: \"Just wanted to share some thoughts...\" or \"I've been thinking about...\"\n\n### 2. The Single Message Body\nDon't cram multiple ideas into one post.\n- **One Post, One Intent**: Stick to one story, one lesson, or one tip.\n- **Scannable Formatting**: Use 1-3 lines per paragraph max.\n- **Mobile-Friendly**: Use whitespace to make it easy to read on phones.\n- **Specifics**: Name tools, give real numbers, and use concrete examples.\n\n### 3. The Discussion-Starting CTA\nEnd with a prompt that invites conversation.\n- **Real Questions**: \"Have you felt this same pressure?\" or \"What's one tool I missed?\"\n- **Low Friction**: Make it easy for people to share their own experience.\n- **Avoid Engagement Bait**: Never use \"Like if you agree\" or \"Comment 'YES' below\".\n- **Optional CTA**: If the post is a heartfelt story, it's okay to skip the CTA entirely.\n\n### 4. Early Engagement Strategy\nLinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes posts that get traction in the first 60-90 minutes.\n- **Reply Immediately**: Engage with every comment in the first hour.\n- **Seed the Link**: If you have a link to share, post it as the first comment after publishing.\n\n## Content Hierarchy\n\nStructure your content ecosystem:\n\n```\n                 ┌─────────────────────────────┐\n                 │      PILLAR CONTENT         │\n                 │  (Blog post, Video, Report) │\n                 └─────────────┬───────────────┘\n                               │\n           ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐\n           │                   │                   │\n           ▼                   ▼                   ▼\n    ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐\n    │ SUPPORTING  │     │ SUPPORTING  │     │ SUPPORTING  │\n    │  Blog posts │     │   Videos    │     │   Emails    │\n    └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘\n           │                   │                   │\n           ▼                   ▼                   ▼\n    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n    │               MICRO CONTENT                         │\n    │  Social posts, Clips, Graphics, Quotes, Stories     │\n    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Rules**:\n- Pillar content: Comprehensive, original, high-effort\n- Supporting content: Derived, expanded on subtopics\n- Micro content: Snackable, platform-native, high-volume\n\n## Efficiency Workflow\n\nBatch production process for maximum efficiency:\n\n### Step 1: Create Pillar Content\n- Invest heavily in one comprehensive piece\n- Make it your best work on the topic\n- Include multiple angles and subtopics\n\n### Step 2: Extract Core Elements\nPull from pillar content:\n- Key insights (3-5)\n- Quotable lines (5-10)\n- Data points (all stats)\n- Steps/processes (full lists)\n- Stories/examples (all narratives)\n\n### Step 3: Map to Platforms\nAssign elements to platforms based on the **AMA Framework**:\n- **Audience**: Who are we talking to on this specific platform?

Bring a real person to mind (a persona) and imagine you are speaking directly to them.\n2. **Message**: What is the one key message they need to hear to move forward?\n3. **Action**: What specific action do you want them to take right now?\n\n## Objective\n\nWrite landing pages and sales copy that motivate immediate action by addressing objections, building desire, and making the next step irresistible.\n\n## Intake Questions\n\nBefore writing conversion copy, gather context:\n\n1. **The Offer**: What exactly are you selling? Features, pricing, terms?\n2. **Target Audience**: Who is this for? What's their current situation and desired future?\n3. **Main Objections**: What are the top 3-5 reasons people don't buy?\n4. **Proof Elements**: What results, testimonials, credentials, or data do you have?\n5. **Competitive Alternatives**: What else could they do instead? Why is this better?\n6. **Desired Action**: What specifically should they do? (Buy, sign up, book call, etc.)\n7. **Traffic Source**: Where are visitors coming from? What do they already know?\n8. **Price Point & Risk**: What does it cost? What guarantees exist?\n\n## Page Architecture\n\nStructure landing pages in this proven sequence:\n\n### 1. Hero Section\nThe first screen - make or break moment.\n\n**Elements**:\n- **Headline**: The big promise or transformation (see headline formulas below)\n- **Subheadline**: Clarify who it's for and the main mechanism\n- **Primary CTA**: The main action button\n- **Hero Image/Video**: Show the product, result, or transformation\n- **Trust Signals**: Logos, ratings, or quick proof\n\n### 2. Problem Agitation\nMake them feel the pain of their current situation.\n\n**Elements**:\n- Describe their current frustrating situation\n- Show you understand their specific struggles\n- Highlight what happens if they don't solve this\n- Use their exact language (mirror their words)\n\n### 3. Solution Introduction\nPresent your approach as the answer.\n\n**Elements**:\n- Introduce your unique mechanism or method\n- Explain why this approach works\n- Differentiate from failed alternatives they've tried\n- Bridge from their problem to your solution\n\n### 4. Features & Benefits\nWhat they get and why it matters.\n\n**Structure for each feature**:\n- Feature: What it is\n- Benefit: What it does for them\n- Proof: Why they should believe it\n\n**Example**:\n- Feature: \"24/7 live chat support\"\n- Benefit: \"Never wait more than 2 minutes for help\"\n- Proof: \"Our average response time is 47 seconds\"\n\n### 5. Social Proof\nLet others do the convincing.\n\n**Types** (use multiple):\n- Customer testimonials (specific results, not generic praise)\n- Case studies with numbers\n- Logos of companies/publications\n- User counts (\"Join 50,000+ marketers\")\n- Expert endorsements\n- Reviews and ratings\n\n**Testimonial Formula**: \"Before [situation]. After [specific result]. Because [what made the difference].\"\n\n### 6. Objection Handling (FAQ)\nAddress every reason they might say no.\n\n**Common objections to address**:\n- \"Is this right for me?\"\n- \"What if it doesn't work?\"\n- \"Why should I trust you?\"\n- \"Is now the right time?\"\n- \"Is it worth the price?\"\n\n### 7. Risk Reversal\nRemove fear of making the wrong choice.\n\n**Elements**:\n- Money-back guarantee (be specific about terms)\n- Free trial period\n- \"Keep everything even if you refund\"\n- Cancel anytime policies\n\n### 8. Final CTA Section\nMake the ask with urgency.\n\n**Elements**:\n- Restate the transformation\n- Summarize key benefits\n- Add urgency (real scarcity, not fake)\n- Clear CTA button\n- Final reassurance\n\n## Cialdini's 6 Persuasion Principles\n\nWeave these throughout the page:\n\n### 1. Reciprocity\nGive value first - free guides, tools, insights.\n*\"Here's a free training on X before you decide...\"*\n\n### 2. Commitment & Consistency\nGet small yeses that lead to big yeses.\n*\"If you've read this far, you're serious about...\"*\n\n### 3. Social Proof\nPeople follow people like themselves.\n*\"10,000+ marketers use this daily...\"*\n\n### 4. Authority\nExpertise and credentials build trust.\n*\"Featured in Forbes, used by Fortune 500...\"*\n\n### 5. Liking\nPeople buy from people they like and relate to.\n*Show personality, share struggles, be human.*\n\n### 6. Scarcity\nLimited availability increases value.\n*\"Only 50 spots available\" (if true)*\n\n## Headline Formulas\n\nUse these proven structures:\n\n### Result Headlines\n- \"How to [achieve result] in [timeframe]\"\n- \"The [number]-step system for [desired outcome]\"\n- \"Get [specific result] without [painful thing]\"\n\n### Question Headlines\n- \"What if you could [desirable outcome]?\"\n- \"Are you making these [number] [topic] mistakes?\"\n- \"Want to know the secret to [desired result]?\"\n\n### Curiosity Headlines\n- \"The [unexpected thing] that [achieves result]\"\n- \"Why [counterintuitive claim]\"\n- \"The hidden [thing] behind [desired outcome]\"\n\n### Direct Headlines\n- \"[Achieve result]. Guaranteed.\"\n- \"Finally, [solution to frustrating problem]\"\n- \"[Number] people can't be wrong\"\n\n## CTA Button Copy\n\nAction-oriented, benefit-focused:\n\n**Bad**: Submit, Sign Up, Buy Now\n**Good**:\n- \"Start My Free Trial\"\n- \"Get Instant Access\"\n- \"Send Me The Guide\"\n- \"Reserve My Spot\"\n- \"Yes, I Want [Specific Benefit]\"\n\n## Specificity Rules\n\nSpecific copy beats generic copy. Always choose:\n\n| Generic (Weak) | Specific (Strong) |\n|----------------|-------------------|\n| \"Save time\" | \"Save 3 hours every week\" |\n| \"Increase revenue\" | \"Add $10K/month in revenue\" |\n| \"Many customers\" | \"12,847 customers\" |\n| \"Fast results\" | \"See results in 14 days\" |\n| \"Expert team\" | \"23 years combined experience\" |\n| \"Affordable\" | \"$49/month (less than $2/day)\" |\n\n## Punctuation & Style Rules\n- **No Em-Dashes**: Do not use em-dashes (-) or en-dashes (-) in any copy. Use hyphens (-), colons, or parentheses instead.\n\n## Output Format\n\nWhen writing direct response copy, deliver:\n\n1. **Strategy Brief**: Audience, offer, main angle, key objections\n2. **Headline Options**: 5-10 headline variations\n3. **Full Page Copy**: Following the architecture above\n4. **CTA Variations**: 3-5 button copy options\n5. **Proof Shopping List**: Specific testimonials/data needed\n6. **Mobile Considerations**: How copy should adapt for mobile\n\n## Cross-References\n\n- Apply `brand-voice` to ensure copy matches brand tone\n- Use `positioning-angles` to inform the main angle and differentiation\n- Landing page for `lead-magnet` uses these same principles\n- Sales emails in `email-sequences` use abbreviated versions\n- `orchestrator` routes here for conversion-focused projects\n",

        "marketing-skills/skills/positioning-angles/SKILL.md": "---\nname: positioning-angles\ndescription: Discovers differentiated market positioning using 8 proven frameworks. This skill should be used when launching a new product or service, entering competitive markets, refreshing stale positioning, or when current messaging sounds like every other competitor.\n---\n\n# Positioning Angles\n\nThis skill identifies unique, defensible market positions that make a brand memorable and different - not just another option in a crowded category.\n\n## Objective\n\nFind the positioning angle that gives the brand unfair advantage: a market position competitors can't or won't copy, that resonates deeply with the target audience.\n\n**The Core Principle**: Effective positioning requires saying something a reasonable person could disagree with. If everyone in the category claims it, it's not a position - it's a table stake.\n\n## Intake Questions\n\nBefore exploring positioning frameworks, gather context:\n\n1. **Product/service**: What exactly does the brand offer? Core features and capabilities?\n2. **Current positioning**: How is it currently described? What's the elevator pitch today?\n3. **Target audience**: Who is the ideal customer? Be specific (demographics, psychographics, behaviors).\n4. **Competitors**: Who are the top 3-5 alternatives? How do they position themselves?\n5. **Unique strengths**: What does this brand do better than anyone else? What's unfair advantage?\n6. **Customer feedback**: What do happy customers say? What words do they use?\n7. **Origin story**: Why was this created? What problem was the founder solving?\n\n## The 8 Positioning Frameworks\n\n### 1. Challenger Brand\n**Best for**: Established markets with dominant players\n\nPosition against the market leader by attacking their weakness or reframing the category.\n\n**Template**: \"Unlike [leader] who [their approach], we [your different approach] because [reason it matters].\"\n\n**Example**: \"Unlike big banks that treat you like a number, we know your name and your goals.\"\n\n### 2. Category Creation\n**Best for**: Truly novel products, new approaches to old problems\n\nCreate and own a new category rather than competing in an existing one.\n\n**Template**: \"We're not a [existing category]. We're the first [new category] that [key differentiator].\"\n\n**Example**: \"We're not a CRM. We're a Revenue Intelligence Platform that predicts your deals.\"\n\n### 3. Niche Domination\n**Best for**: Broad markets with underserved segments\n\nOwn a specific vertical, use case, or customer segment completely.\n\n**Template**: \"The only [product type] built specifically for [niche segment].\"\n\n**Example**: \"The only accounting software built specifically for freelance photographers.\"\n\n### 4. Value Proposition Canvas\n**Best for**: Customer-centric positioning, product-market fit\n\nMap customer jobs, pains, and gains to product features, pain relievers, and gain creators.\n\n**Structure**:\n- **Customer Jobs**: What are they trying to accomplish?\n- **Pains**: What frustrates them about current solutions?\n- **Gains**: What would make their life better?\n- **Pain Relievers**: How do you eliminate their frustrations?\n- **Gain Creators**: How do you deliver desired outcomes?\n\n### 5. Competitive Positioning Matrix\n**Best for**: Crowded markets, clear differentiation\n\nPlot competitors on two axes that matter to customers, then own an unoccupied quadrant.\n\n**Process**:\n1. List what customers care about most\n2. Select two dimensions competitors vary on\n3. Plot all competitors on the 2x2 matrix\n4. Identify the empty or underserved quadrant\n5. Position there if you can authentically deliver\n\n**Example Axes**: Price/Quality, Simple/Powerful, Traditional/Modern, Fast/Thorough\n\n### 6. Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Template\n**Best for**: B2B products, technical products, investor pitches\n\nThe classic fill-in-the-blank framework:\n\n**Template**:\n\"For [target customer]\nwho [statement of need or opportunity],\n[product name] is a [product category]\nthat [key benefit/reason to buy].\nUnlike [primary competitive alternative],\nour product [primary differentiation].\"\n\n### 7. Blue Ocean Strategy\n**Best for**: Commoditized markets, breakthrough positioning\n\nFind uncontested market space by eliminating, reducing, raising, or creating factors.\n\n**Four Actions Framework**:\n- **Eliminate**: What factors can you eliminate that the industry takes for granted?\n- **Reduce**: What factors can you reduce well below industry standard?\n- **Raise**: What factors can you raise well above industry standard?\n- **Create**: What factors can you create that the industry has never offered?\n\n### 8. Jobs-to-be-Done\n**Best for**: Outcome-focused positioning, crossing category boundaries\n\nPosition around the outcome customers hire your product to achieve, not features.\n\n**Template**: \"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].\"\n\n**Positioning statement**: \"We help [customer] [achieve outcome] when [trigger situation].\"\n\n**Example**: \"We help busy professionals feel put-together when they have 10 minutes to dress.\"\n\n## Framework Selection Guide\n\n| Situation | Recommended Framework |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| Market has dominant leader | Challenger Brand |\n| Truly new/novel product | Category Creation |\n| Big market, specific audience | Niche Domination |\n| Need product-market fit | Value Proposition Canvas |\n| Many similar competitors | Competitive Positioning Matrix |\n| B2B or complex product | Geoffrey Moore Template |\n| Commoditized market | Blue Ocean Strategy |\n| Feature parity with competitors | Jobs-to-be-Done |\n\n## Validation Criteria\n\nTest positioning against these criteria:\n\n- [ ] **Distinctive**: No competitor could claim the same thing\n- [ ] **Relevant**: Target audience cares about this difference\n- [ ] **Credible**: Brand can deliver on the promise authentically\n- [ ] **Sustainable**: Not easily copied by competitors\n- [ ] **Memorable**: Can be expressed in a single sentence\n- [ ] **Motivating**: Gives audience a reason to choose you\n\n## Output Format\n\nWhen developing positioning, produce:\n\n1. **Context Summary**: Market landscape and competitive set\n2. **Framework Analysis**: Deep dive using 2-3 most relevant frameworks\n3. **Positioning Options**: 3-5 potential angles with pros/cons\n4. **Recommended Position**: The winning angle with rationale\n5. **Positioning Statement**: One-paragraph articulation\n6. **Proof Points**: Evidence that supports the position\n\n## Cross-References\n\n- Positioning informs messaging in `direct-response-copy`\n- Use positioning to frame `lead-magnet` offers\n- `brand-voice` should align with and support the chosen position\n- Positioning angles guide topic selection in `keyword-research`\n- `orchestrator` routes here first for new product launches\n",

Take a stand that a reasonable person could disagree with.\n- **Human-Led Outlines**: Always start with a human-designed outline that prioritizes the narrative arc over keyword placement.\n- **Inject \"Un-AI\" Statements**: Use humor, opinion, or unique perspectives that AI is unlikely to generate spontaneously.\n- **Radical Specificity**: Back up every point with specific, real-world examples or data points.\n- **Avoid Clichés**: If you find yourself using the same phrasing as every other article on the SERP, start over and find a different angle.\n\n| Over-Optimized (Bad) | Natural (Good) |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| \"Best coffee makers.
