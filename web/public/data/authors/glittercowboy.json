Happy building.\n\n— TÂCHES\n\n## What's Inside\n\n**[Commands](#commands)** (27 total) - Slash commands that expand into structured workflows\n- **Meta-Prompting**: Separate planning from execution with staged prompts\n- **Todo Management**: Capture context mid-work, resume later with full state\n- **Thinking Models**: Mental frameworks (first principles, inversion, 80/20, etc.)\n- **Deep Analysis**: Systematic debugging methodology with evidence and hypothesis testing\n\n**[Skills](#skills)** (9 total) - Autonomous workflows that research, generate, and self-heal\n- **Create Plans**: Hierarchical project planning for solo developer + Claude workflows\n- **Create MCP Servers**: Build MCP servers for Claude integrations (Python/TypeScript)\n- **Create Agent Skills**: Build new skills by describing what you want\n- **Create Meta-Prompts**: Generate staged workflow prompts with dependency detection\n- **Create Slash Commands**: Build custom commands with proper structure\n- **Create Subagents**: Build specialized Claude instances for isolated contexts\n- **Create Hooks**: Build event-driven automation\n- **Debug Like Expert**: Systematic debugging with evidence gathering and hypothesis testing\n- **Setup Ralph**: Set up Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum autonomous coding loop\n\n**[Agents](#agents)** (3 total) - Specialized subagents for validation and quality\n- **skill-auditor**: Reviews skills for best practices compliance\n- **slash-command-auditor**: Reviews commands for proper structure\n- **subagent-auditor**: Reviews agent configurations for effectiveness\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Plugin Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources\n\n# Install the plugin\nclaude plugin install taches-cc-resources\n```\n\nStart a new Claude Code session to use the commands and skills.\n\n### Option 2: Manual Install\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources.git\ncd taches-cc-resources\n\n# Install commands\ncp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/\n\n# Install skills\ncp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\nCommands install globally to `~/.claude/commands/`. Skills install to `~/.claude/skills/`. Project-specific data (prompts, todos) lives in each project's working directory.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Meta-Prompting\n\nSeparate analysis from execution. Describe what you want in natural language, Claude generates a rigorous prompt, then runs it in a fresh sub-agent context.\n\n- [`/create-prompt`](./commands/create-prompt.md) - Generate optimized prompts with XML structure\n- [`/run-prompt`](./commands/run-prompt.md) - Execute saved prompts in sub-agent contexts\n\n### Todo Management\n\nCapture ideas mid-conversation without derailing current work. Resume later with full context intact.\n\n- [`/add-to-todos`](./commands/add-to-todos.md) - Capture tasks with full context\n- [`/check-todos`](./commands/check-todos.md) - Resume work on captured tasks\n\n### Context Handoff\n\nCreate structured handoff documents to continue work in a fresh context. Reference with `@whats-next.md` to resume seamlessly.\n\n- [`/whats-next`](./commands/whats-next.md) - Create handoff document for fresh context\n\n### Create Extensions\n\nWrapper commands that invoke the skills below.\n\n- [`/create-agent-skill`](./commands/create-agent-skill.md) - Create a new skill\n- [`/create-meta-prompt`](./commands/create-meta-prompt.md) - Create staged workflow prompts\n- [`/create-slash-command`](./commands/create-slash-command.md) - Create a new slash command\n- [`/create-subagent`](./commands/create-subagent.md) - Create a new subagent\n- [`/create-hook`](./commands/create-hook.md) - Create a new hook\n\n### Audit Extensions\n\nInvoke auditor subagents.\n\n- [`/audit-skill`](./commands/audit-skill.md) - Audit skill for best practices\n- [`/audit-slash-command`](./commands/audit-slash-command.md) - Audit command for best practices\n- [`/audit-subagent`](./commands/audit-subagent.md) - Audit subagent for best practices\n\n### Self-Improvement\n\n- [`/heal-skill`](./commands/heal-skill.md) - Fix skills based on execution issues\n\n### Thinking Models\n\nApply mental frameworks to decisions and problems.\n\n- [`/consider:pareto`](./commands/consider/pareto.md) - Apply 80/20 rule to focus on what matters\n- [`/consider:first-principles`](./commands/consider/first-principles.md) - Break down to fundamentals and rebuild\n- [`/consider:inversion`](./commands/consider/inversion.md) - Solve backwards (what guarantees failure?)\n- [`/consider:second-order`](./commands/consider/second-order.md) - Think through consequences of consequences\n- [`/consider:5-whys`](./commands/consider/5-whys.md) - Drill to root cause\n- [`/consider:occams-razor`](./commands/consider/occams-razor.md) - Find simplest explanation\n- [`/consider:one-thing`](./commands/consider/one-thing.md) - Identify highest-leverage action\n- [`/consider:swot`](./commands/consider/swot.md) - Map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats\n- [`/consider:eisenhower-matrix`](./commands/consider/eisenhower-matrix.md) - Prioritize by urgent/important\n- [`/consider:10-10-10`](./commands/consider/10-10-10.md) - Evaluate across time horizons\n- [`/consider:opportunity-cost`](./commands/consider/opportunity-cost.md) - Analyze what you give up\n- [`/consider:via-negativa`](./commands/consider/via-negativa.md) - Improve by removing\n\n### Deep Analysis\n\nSystematic debugging with methodical investigation.\n\n- [`/debug`](./commands/debug.md) - Apply expert debugging methodology to investigate issues\n\n## Agents\n\nSpecialized subagents used by the audit commands.\n\n- [`skill-auditor`](./agents/skill-auditor.md) - Expert skill auditor for best practices compliance\n- [`slash-command-auditor`](./agents/slash-command-auditor.md) - Expert slash command auditor\n- [`subagent-auditor`](./agents/subagent-auditor.md) - Expert subagent configuration auditor\n\n## Skills\n\n### [Create Plans](./skills/create-plans/)\n\nHierarchical project planning optimized for solo developer + Claude. Create executable plans that Claude runs, not enterprise documentation that sits unused.\n\n**PLAN.md IS the prompt** - not documentation that gets transformed later. Brief → Roadmap → Research (if needed) → PLAN.md → Execute → SUMMARY.md.\n\n**Domain-aware:** Optionally loads framework-specific expertise from `~/.claude/skills/expertise/` (e.g., macos-apps, iphone-apps) to make plans concrete instead of generic. Domain expertise skills are created with [create-agent-skills](#create-agent-skills) - exhaustive knowledge bases (5k-10k+ lines) that make task specifications framework-appropriate.\n\n**Quality controls:** Research includes verification checklists, blind spots review, critical claims audits, and streaming writes to prevent gaps and token limit failures.\n\n**Context management:** Auto-handoff at 10% tokens remaining. Git versioning commits outcomes, not process.\n\n**Commands:** `/create-plan` (invoke skill), `/run-plan <path>` (execute PLAN.md with intelligent segmentation)\n\nSee [create-plans README](./skills/create-plans/README.md) for full documentation.\n\n### [Create Agent Skills](./skills/create-agent-skills/)\n\nBuild skills by describing what you want. Asks clarifying questions, researches APIs if needed, and generates properly structured skill files.\n\n**Two types of skills:**\n1. **Task-execution skills** - Regular skills that perform specific operations\n2. **Domain expertise skills** - Exhaustive knowledge bases (5k-10k+ lines) that live in `~/.claude/skills/expertise/` and provide framework-specific context to other skills like [create-plans](#create-plans)\n\n**Context-aware:** Detects if you're in a skill directory and presents relevant options. Progressive disclosure guides you through complex choices.\n\nWhen things don't work perfectly, `/heal-skill` analyzes what went wrong and updates the skill based on what actually worked.\n\nCommands: `/create-agent-skill`, `/heal-skill`, `/audit-skill`\n\n### [Create Meta-Prompts](./skills/create-meta-prompts/)\n\nThe skill-based evolution of the meta-prompting system. Builds prompts with structured outputs (research.md, plan.md) that subsequent prompts can parse. Adds automatic dependency detection to chain research → plan → implement workflows.\n\n**Note:** For end-to-end project building, consider [create-plans](#create-plans) - it's the more structured evolution of this approach with full lifecycle management (brief → roadmap → execution → handoffs). Use create-meta-prompts for abstract workflows and Claude→Claude pipelines. Use create-plans for actually building projects.\n\nCommands: `/create-meta-prompt`\n\n### [Create Slash Commands](./skills/create-slash-commands/)\n\nBuild commands that expand into full prompts when invoked. Describe the command you want, get proper YAML configuration with arguments, tool restrictions, and dynamic context loading.\n\nCommands: `/create-slash-command`, `/audit-slash-command`\n\n### [Create Subagents](./skills/create-subagents/)\n\nBuild specialized Claude instances that run in isolated contexts. Describe the agent's purpose, get optimized system prompts with the right tool access and orchestration patterns.\n\nCommands: `/create-subagent`, `/audit-subagent`\n\n### [Create Hooks](./skills/create-hooks/)\n\nBuild event-driven automation that triggers on tool calls, session events, or prompt submissions. Describe what you want to automate, get working hook configurations.\n\nCommands: `/create-hook`\n\n### [Create MCP Servers](./skills/create-mcp-servers/)\n\nBuild Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts to Claude. Supports Python and TypeScript implementations with API research, OAuth handling, and response optimization.\n\n**Architecture patterns:** Traditional (1-2 operations) or on-demand discovery (3+ operations) based on complexity.\n\n**Includes:** Adaptive intake, API research via subagent, code generation from templates, environment variable security, and installation in Claude Code + Claude Desktop.\n\nCommands: `/create-mcp-servers` (via skill routing)\n\n### [Debug Like Expert](./skills/debug-like-expert/)\n\nDeep analysis debugging mode for complex issues. Activates methodical investigation protocol with evidence gathering, hypothesis testing, and rigorous verification. Use when standard troubleshooting fails or when issues require systematic root cause analysis.\n\nCommands: `/debug`\n\n### [Setup Ralph](./skills/setup-ralph/)\n\nSet up Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum autonomous coding loop. Ralph is an autonomous AI coding methodology that uses iterative loops with task selection, execution, and validation. Fresh context every iteration prevents context poisoning.\n\n**Three phases:** Planning (gap analysis → TODO list), Building (implement one task, validate, commit), Observation (you engineer the environment).\n\n**Key concepts:** Backpressure via tests/lints/builds, file I/O as state (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), parallel subagents for reads, prompts evolve through observation.\n\nCommands: `/setup-ralph`\n\nSee [setup-ralph README](./skills/setup-ralph/README.md) for full documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\n**For building projects:** Use `/create-plan` to invoke the [create-plans](#create-plans) skill. After planning, use `/run-plan <path-to-PLAN.md>` to execute phases with intelligent segmentation. This provides hierarchical planning (BRIEF.md → ROADMAP.md → phases/PLAN.md), domain-aware task generation, context management with handoffs, and git versioning.\n\n**For domain expertise:** Use [create-agent-skills](#create-agent-skills) to create exhaustive knowledge bases in `~/.claude/skills/expertise/`. These skills are automatically loaded by create-plans to make task specifications framework-specific instead of generic.\n\n**Other tools:** The [create-meta-prompts](#create-meta-prompts-1) skill and `/create-prompt` + `/run-prompt` commands are available for custom Claude→Claude pipelines that don't fit the project planning structure.\n\n---\n\nMore resources coming soon.\n\n---\n\n**Community Ports:** [OpenCode](https://github.com/stephenschoettler/taches-oc-prompts)\n\n—TÂCHES\n"
