        "README.md": "# Deepbits Cyber Assistant Plugin for Claude Code\n\nThe Plugin equips Claude Code with advanced binary analysis capabilities for tasks such as incident response, malware investigation, and vulnerability assessment. It connects to both cloud-based analysis platforms and local tools via MCP, enabling seamless hybrid workflows. With features including local Windows system scanning, browser hijacking detection, registry and network monitoring, suspicious file analysis, and remote binary analysis through tools like Ghidra, Qilin, and angr, the plugin transforms Claude Code into a powerful AI-assisted workspace for comprehensive system and binary security analysis.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Claude Code Security Analysis Plugin extends Claude Code with advanced cybersecurity and binary-analysis capabilities, enabling developers and analysts to perform in-depth system investigations directly within their coding environment.\n\nThis plugin seamlessly integrates with both cloud-based analysis platforms and local security tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating a unified workspace for intelligent, AI-assisted security analysis.\n\nDesigned for incident response, malware forensics, and vulnerability research, the plugin empowers users to:\n\n- 🧩 Investigate compromised systems to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and attack traces.\n\n- 🦠 Analyze malware samples to uncover behaviors, persistence methods, and payloads.\n\n- 🛡️ Perform vulnerability and exploit analysis, including binary diffing, patch validation, and code comparison.\n\n- ⚙️ Combine cloud automation with local expertise, integrating Deepbits’ agentic binary-analysis capabilities into Claude Code.\n\nSpecialized Cybersecurity Capabilities\n\nThis plugin provides Claude Code with specialized cybersecurity features, including:\n\n- 💻 Local Windows system scanning for malware, configuration weaknesses, and security issues.\n\n- 🌐 Browser hijacking detection to identify malicious extensions or modified settings.\n\n- 🧮 Windows Registry analysis to reveal persistence mechanisms or misconfigurations.\n\n- 🧾 Suspicious file detection through behavioral and signature-based analysis.\n\n- 🔗 Network connection monitoring for unusual or unauthorized communications.\n\n- 🧠 Remote binary file analysis powered by Ghidra, Qilin, angr, and other advanced analysis frameworks.\n\nTogether, these capabilities transform Claude Code into a comprehensive cybersecurity co-pilot—bridging the gap between code intelligence, system defense, and binary analysis.\n\n## Features\n\n### 🛡️ Security Scanning\n- Comprehensive system security assessments\n- Browser hijacking detection across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and IE\n- Windows Registry malware persistence detection\n- Suspicious file system scanning\n- Active network connection monitoring\n\n### 🔍 Binary Analysis\n- Upload suspicious files to remote sandbox\n- Advanced static and dynamic analysis\n- Malware classification and threat assessment\n- Indicator of Compromise (IoC) extraction\n- Detailed decompilation and code analysis\n\n### 🤖 Specialized Agent\nThe **Cyber Security Analyst** agent provides expert-level security analysis with:\n- Structured threat assessment workflow\n- Evidence-based reporting\n- Risk prioritization (Critical/High/Medium/Low)\n- Actionable remediation steps\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone or download this plugin to your local machine\n2. **Start the MCP server** (required before running Claude Code):\n   ```bash\n   npx -y @drbinary/claude-mcp-server\n   ```\n   **Note:** The MCP server must be running before you start Claude Code. Keep this terminal open. This command can be executed from any folder.\n3. Run claude code (in a new terminal):\n   ```bash\n   claude\n   ```\n   **Note:** The `claude` command can be executed from any folder.\n4. Add marketplace:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add DeepBitsTechnology/claude-plugins\n   ```\n5. Install the plugin:\n   ```\n   /plugin install drbinary-chat-plugin@DeepBitsTechnology\n   ```\n6. Connect MCP server:\n   ```\n   /mcp\n   ```\n\n### Important Configuration\n\n#### MCP Server Startup\n\n**The MCP server will NOT start automatically.** You must manually run the following command before starting Claude Code:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @drbinary/claude-mcp-server\n```\n\nKeep this terminal open while using the plugin, as Claude Code requires the MCP server to be running for binary analysis features.\n\n#### MCP Timeout Setting\n\nBinary analysis using disassemblers like Ghidra can take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for large or complex binaries. If you encounter MCP timeout issues during analysis, you should increase the `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` environment variable.\n\n**Recommended setting:**\n```bash\nexport MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=600000\n```\n\nThis sets the timeout to 600,000 milliseconds (10 minutes), which provides sufficient time for the disassembler to analyze binary files thoroughly. You can adjust this value based on your needs, but it's recommended to use a larger value to avoid interruptions during deep analysis.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\ndrbinary-chat-plugin/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest\n├── .mcp.json                 # MCP server configuration\n├── agents/\n│   └── cyber-security-analyst.md    # Specialized security analyst agent\n├── skills/\n│   └── binary-analysis/\n│       └── SKILL.md          # Binary analysis skill (with YAML frontmatter)\n├── commands/\n│   ├── scan-system.md\n│   ├── scan-registry.md\n│   ├── analyze-binary.md\n│   ├── check-browser-hijack.md\n│   ├── scan-suspicious-files.md\n│   └── check-network.md\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Skills Format\n\nThe `binary-analysis` skill follows the proper Claude Code skill format with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: binary-analysis\ndescription: Analyze suspicious binary files using remote Ghidra tools...\n---\n```\n\nThis allows Claude to automatically recognize when to activate binary analysis capabilities.\n\n## Available Commands\n\n### `/scan-system`\nPerform a comprehensive security scan of the local system including:\n- Browser hijacking checks\n- Registry analysis\n- Process monitoring\n- Startup program review\n- File system scanning\n- Network connection analysis\n\n### `/scan-registry`\nDeep scan of Windows Registry for:\n- Malware persistence mechanisms\n- Autostart locations\n- Browser setting hijacks\n- Policy restrictions\n- Shell extensions\n\n### `/analyze-binary <file-path>`\nUpload and analyze a suspicious binary file:\n1.
