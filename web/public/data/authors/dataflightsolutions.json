        "plugins/graphite/README.md": "# graphite\n\nAutomate Graphite stacked diff workflows with slash commands for creating diffs and submitting PRs.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin provides commands that wrap the Graphite CLI (`gt`) to streamline the stacked diff workflow. Instead of manually running git and gt commands, use these slash commands to create diffs and submit pull requests.\n\n## Stacked Diff Philosophy\n\nThe commands in this plugin follow stacked diff best practices:\n\n- **One logical change per diff**: Each diff should represent a single, atomic change that can be reviewed and landed independently.\n- **Clear commit messages**: Conventional commit format with descriptive messages that explain what and why.\n- **Incremental building**: Stack multiple small diffs rather than one large change.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/graphite:create`\n\nCreate a new stacked diff from current changes without submitting a PR.\n\n**Alias**: `/graphite:gt-create`\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Validates git repository and gt CLI availability\n2. Analyzes current changes (staged and unstaged)\n3. Generates a conventional commit message\n4. Runs `gt create --all -m \"<message>\"`\n\n**Use when**: You want to create a diff but review it before opening a PR, or when building a stack of multiple diffs.\n\n### `/graphite:submit`\n\nSubmit the current branch as a pull request.\n\n**Alias**: `/graphite:gt-submit`\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Validates environment\n2. Runs `gt submit` to push and create/update the PR\n\n**Use when**: You have a diff ready and want to open or update a PR.\n\n### `/graphite:create-submit`\n\nCreate a diff and submit it as a PR in one step.\n\n**Alias**: `/graphite:gt-create-submit`\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Everything from `/graphite:create`\n2. Immediately runs `/graphite:submit`\n\n**Use when**: You have a complete, self-contained change ready for review.\n\n## Commit Message Format\n\nAll commands generate commit messages following this format:\n\n```\ntype(scope): short description\n\nOptional longer explanation of what changed and why.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Code\n```\n\n**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, style, build, ci\n\n**Examples**:\n```\nfeat(auth): add JWT token refresh endpoint\n\nfix(api): handle null response from external service\n\nrefactor(utils): extract date formatting into separate module\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Graphite CLI**: `npm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli@latest`\n- **Git repository**: Must be in an initialized git repo\n- **Graphite setup**: Run `gt init` in your repository if not already configured\n\n## Workflow Examples\n\n### Building a stack incrementally\n\n```\n# Make first change\n/graphite:create          # Creates diff 1\n\n# Make second change on top\n/graphite:create          # Creates diff 2, stacked on diff 1\n\n# Make third change\n/graphite:create          # Creates diff 3\n\n# Submit all when ready\ngt submit --stack         # (run manually to submit entire stack)\n```\n\n### Quick single-diff workflow\n\n```\n# Make your changes\n/graphite:create-submit   # Creates diff and opens PR immediately\n```\n\n### Review before submitting\n\n```\n# Make changes\n/graphite:create          # Creates the diff\n\n# Review in GitHub or locally\n# Make adjustments if needed\n\n/graphite:submit          # Submit when satisfied\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"Graphite CLI not found\"**\n\nInstall the CLI:\n```bash\nnpm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli@latest\n```\n\n**\"Not in a git repository\"**\n\nNavigate to a git repository before running commands.\n\n**\"Not authenticated\"**\n\nRun `gt auth` to authenticate with GitHub.\n\n**\"Branch not tracked by Graphite\"**\n\nThe branch was created outside of gt. Use `gt create` to create Graphite-tracked branches.\n\n## Development\n\n- **Version**: 1.0.0\n- **Commands**: 3 primary + 3 aliases (gt-create, gt-submit, gt-create-submit)\n- **Dependencies**: Graphite CLI\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
