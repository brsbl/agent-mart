        "README.md": "# AI PM Copilot for Claude Code\n\n> Answer PM's hardest questions in minutes, not days\n\n**Expert PM guidance powered by frameworks from Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford, and more - without hiring a PM.**\n\nRight feature. Right users. Right time. Right reasons.\n\nNot a project management tool. Not a generic AI assistant. A specialized copilot that combines:\n- **Speed of AI** (answers in minutes)\n- **Depth of PM frameworks** (Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford)\n- **Context-aware reasoning** (remembers your product, personalizes outputs)\n\nBuilt for solo developers and small teams who need enterprise PM capabilities without the complexity.\n\n## Why AI PM Copilot?\n\n**You're a solo founder building your first product.** You can code, but PM decisions feel like guesswork:\n- \"Should I build feature X or Y first?\"\n- \"How do I validate this idea without wasting weeks?\"\n- \"Which users should I target?\"\n- \"When is the right time to launch?\"\n\n**Generic AI** (ChatGPT, Claude): Fast answers, but no PM frameworks or strategic depth  \n**Enterprise PM tools** (Jira, Aha!): Deep features, but slow, complex, and expensive  \n**Manual PM work** (Notion, templates): Flexible, but requires expertise you don't have  \n\n**AI PM Copilot:** Expert PM frameworks + AI speed = rigorous answers delivered in minutes.\n\nBuilt on 16 proven methodologies from PM thought leaders. Context-aware intelligence that remembers your product. Developer-native experience inside Claude Code.\n\n## Built on Proven PM Frameworks\n\nAI PM Copilot isn't generic AI advice - it's built on expert frameworks from PM thought leaders:\n\n**Research & Discovery:** Teresa Torres (Continuous Discovery), Erika Hall (Just Enough Research)  \n**Strategy & Goals:** Marty Cagan (Empowered), Sean Ellis (Product-Market Fit), April Dunford (Positioning)  \n**Execution & Planning:** Jeff Patton (Story Mapping), Basecamp (Shape Up), Google (HEART/Goals)  \n**Prioritization:** Intercom (RICE), Dan Olsen (Lean Product Playbook)  \n\n16 proven methodologies. 100+ templates and frameworks. Expert rigor at AI speed.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Just talk to your PM expert agents like you would a consultant:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Tell product-manager: I'm building a SaaS analytics tool. Should I prioritize dashboards or API access first?\"\n\nproduct-manager: Let me help you score these features using RICE framework...\n\n[Routes to feature-prioritizer]\n[Reads your product context from setup]\n[Returns scored recommendations with rationale]\n\nResult: Expert RICE scoring in 2 minutes with explanation of why each feature ranks where it does.\n```\n\n**Try it yourself:**\n1. Install: `/plugin install ai-pm-copilot`\n2. Setup (optional, 5-10 min): `/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup`\n3. Ask: \"Tell product-manager: [your PM question]\"\n\n## What's Included\n\n**8 Expert PM Agents** - Available 24/7 for research, strategy, execution, and launch (1 orchestrator + 7 specialists)  \n**1 Utility Agent** - Automated codebase context discovery (context-scanner)  \n**16 Proven Frameworks** - RICE, JTBD, Lean Startup, Story Mapping, and more  \n**100+ Templates & Assets** - PRD templates, roadmap frameworks, interview guides  \n**Context-Aware Intelligence** - One-time setup, personalized outputs across all agents    \n\nBuilt on frameworks from Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, April Dunford, Sean Ellis, Jeff Patton, and more. \n\n## Get Started (5 Minutes to Your First Expert Answer)\n\n### 1.

Intelligent agent that routes requests to specialized experts\n\n**Use for:**\n- General PM questions and guidance\n- Multi-faceted problems requiring multiple perspectives\n- When unsure which specialist to consult\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell product-manager: \"I need to validate a feature idea, prioritize it, and plan delivery\"\n→ Routes to research-ops, feature-prioritizer, and requirements-engineer\n```\n\n### 2. market-analyst\n**Market research, competitive analysis, and positioning**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Competitive landscape analysis\n- Market sizing and opportunity assessment\n- Product positioning and differentiation\n- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations\n- Win/loss analysis\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell market-analyst: \"Analyze our position against competitors in the project management space\"\nTell market-analyst: \"Research competitive landscape for project management tools\"\n```\n\n### 3. research-ops\n**User research, interviews, and validation**\n\n**Use for:**\n- User interview planning and synthesis\n- Usability testing\n- Problem/solution validation\n- Customer feedback analysis\n- Research program design\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell research-ops: \"Design a study to understand why 30% of users churn after first month\"\nTell research-ops: \"Synthesize these interview transcripts into themes and insights\"\n```\n\n### 4. product-strategist\n**Vision, strategy, and goals**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Product vision and strategy\n- Quarterly and annual goals\n- Strategic roadmaps\n- North Star metric definition\n- Strategic trade-offs\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell product-strategist: \"Create Q2 2025 goals focused on reaching product-market fit\"\n```\n\n### 5. roadmap-builder\n**Roadmap planning and sequencing**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Now-Next-Later roadmaps\n- Theme-based roadmaps\n- Quarterly planning\n- Feature sequencing and phasing\n- Milestone planning\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell roadmap-builder: \"Build a 6-month roadmap for our mobile app launch\"\n```\n\n### 6. feature-prioritizer\n**RICE, ICE, and prioritization frameworks**\n\n**Use for:**\n- RICE/ICE scoring\n- Kano model analysis\n- Value vs Effort matrices\n- Trade-off decisions\n- Backlog ranking\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell feature-prioritizer: \"Score these 10 features using RICE framework\"\n```\n\n### 7. requirements-engineer\n**PRDs, specs, and user stories**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Product requirements documents (PRDs)\n- Technical specifications\n- User story writing\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Feature documentation\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell requirements-engineer: \"Write a comprehensive PRD for dark mode feature\"\n```\n\n### 8. launch-planner\n**Go-to-market and launch execution**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Launch planning and execution\n- GTM strategy and distribution channel selection\n- Beta programs\n- Launch messaging and positioning\n- Community launches (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTell launch-planner: \"Create a launch plan for our new API product\"\n```\n\n### 9. context-scanner (Utility Agent)\n**Automated strategic context discovery from codebase**\n\n**Use for:**\n- Auto-discovering features, tech stack, and integrations during setup\n- Refreshing stale context when product changes\n- Getting accurate baseline for competitive analysis\n- Fast onboarding on existing projects\n\n**What it discovers:**\n- Features (from routes, pages, API endpoints)\n- Tech stack (from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)\n- Integrations (from 3rd party packages)\n- Project scale (files, LOC, complexity)\n\n**What it doesn't do:**\n- Code quality or architecture analysis\n- Performance or security assessment\n- Engineering recommendations\n\n**Note:** This is a utility agent (not a PM specialist) that uses Haiku model for efficient file operations. It's automatically invoked by pm-setup when you have an existing codebase, or can be invoked by PM agents when they need current product state.\n\n**Example (automatic invocation):**\n```\n/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup\n→ Detects codebase\n→ \"Scan codebase to auto-discover context? (yes/no)\"\n→ If yes: context-scanner runs, presents findings for validation\n→ Time saved: 10-15 minutes vs manual entry\n```\n\n## Agent Routing Pattern\n\nThe **product-manager** agent acts as an intelligent router that:\n\n1. Analyzes your request to understand the PM discipline(s) needed\n2. Routes to the appropriate specialist agent(s)\n3. Coordinates multi-agent workflows when needed\n4. Synthesizes outputs from multiple specialists\n\n**Simple routing:**\n```\nTell product-manager: \"Help me prioritize features\"\n→ Routes to feature-prioritizer\n```\n\n**Multi-agent workflow:**\n```\nTell product-manager: \"Validate this feature idea and create a launch plan\"\n→ Routes to research-ops (validation)\n→ Then to launch-planner (GTM strategy)\n→ Synthesizes complete plan\n```\n\n**You can also bypass routing:**\n```\nTell feature-prioritizer: \"Score these features with RICE\"\n→ Goes directly to specialist\n```\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are knowledge frameworks that agents load progressively when needed, organized by the product development journey:\n\n### Stage 1: Validation (Before writing code)\nIs this idea worth my time? Who are my competitors?\n- **competitive-analysis-templates** - SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, competitive positioning\n- **market-sizing-frameworks** - TAM/SAM/SOM, market validation\n- **product-positioning** - April Dunford framework, differentiation strategy\n\n### Stage 2: Understanding (Who am I building for?)\nWho are my users? What problems am I solving?\n- **user-research-techniques** - Interviews, surveys, usability testing, JTBD\n- **interview-frameworks** - Interview design, questioning, synthesis\n- **synthesis-frameworks** - Affinity mapping, insight generation\n- **usability-frameworks** - Usability testing, Nielsen principles\n- **validation-frameworks** - Problem/solution validation, MVP testing\n\n### Stage 3: Scoping (What's the MVP?)\nWhat features do I build? How do I avoid scope creep?\n- **prioritization-methods** - RICE, ICE, Kano, Value vs Effort\n- **product-market-fit** - PMF indicators, Sean Ellis test, MVP scoping\n\n### Stage 4: Speccing (Make Claude Code build it well)\nClear requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria\n- **specification-techniques** - Requirements writing, clarity\n- **prd-templates** - PRD formats and best practices\n- **user-story-templates** - User story formats, INVEST criteria\n\n### Stage 5: Planning (What's my roadmap?)\nPhase 1, 2, 3 and milestone planning\n- **roadmap-frameworks** - Now-Next-Later, outcome-based roadmaps\n\n### Stage 6: Launch (How do I get users?)\nWhere do I launch? What's my messaging?\n- **go-to-market-playbooks** - GTM strategies, distribution channels\n- **launch-planning-frameworks** - Launch tiers, timelines, execution\n\n## Setup Command\n\n### /ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup\n\n**One-time context setup that makes everything better.**\n\nCreates 8 core context files that all agents reference:\n\n```\n.claude/product-context/\n  ├── product-info.md          # Product description, users, value prop\n  ├── business-metrics.md      # ARR, users, growth, retention\n  ├── strategic-goals.md       # Goals, priorities, themes\n  ├── current-roadmap.md       # Now-Next-Later roadmap\n  ├── tech-stack.md           # Architecture, tech, constraints\n  ├── customer-segments.md     # Personas, segments, ICP\n  ├── team-info.md            # Team size, roles, constraints\n  └── competitive-landscape.md # Competitors, positioning\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Agents ask 80% fewer questions\n- Outputs are product-specific, not generic\n- Context reused across all agents and skills\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n# First-time setup\n/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup\n\n# Update context later\n/ai-pm-copilot:pm-setup --update\n```\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Agent-First Design\n\n- **Single plugin** instead of multiple separate plugins\n- **Main orchestration agent + 7 specialist agents** with clear responsibilities\n- **Intelligent routing** through main product-manager agent\n- **Progressive skills** that load on-demand\n- **Solo developer focus** - no enterprise complexity\n\n### Agent-First Benefits\n\n- Natural conversation instead of memorizing commands\n- Agents collaborate automatically\n- Context flows between specialists\n- Simpler mental model\n- Single plugin install with everything included\n\n### Model Strategy\n\n- Expert-level strategic reasoning\n- Nuanced decision-making\n- Context-aware responses\n- High-quality outputs\n\n## Creating PRDs\n\nUse **requirements-engineer** to create Product Requirements Documents with automatic template selection:\n\n```\nTell requirements-engineer: \"Write a PRD for [your feature]\"\n```\n\n**Intelligent Template Selection:**\nrequirements-engineer uses complexity assessment to automatically select the right template:\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Assesses 3 dimensions: Technical Complexity, Risk/Impact, Scope Breadth (0-10 each)\n2. Reads repository context (`.claude/product-context/tech-stack.md`, etc.) for informed scoring\n3. Applies decision thresholds based on average complexity score\n4. Communicates reasoning transparently with complexity breakdown\n\n**Templates:**\n- **Lean PRD** (1-2 pages): Low complexity (avg < 4), < 1 week, simple features\n- **Comprehensive PRD** (3-5 pages): Moderate complexity (avg 4-7), standard features [DEFAULT]\n- **Amazon PR/FAQ** (3-6 pages): New products (detected by keywords)\n- **Google PRD** (5-10 pages): High risk (security/payments) or scale-critical (high complexity)\n\n**Example reasoning:** \"OAuth authentication\" → Google PRD (Risk: 9/10 security-critical, triggers high-detail template)\n\nYou can always request a different template if the automatic selection doesn't fit your needs.\n\n**Storage:**\nPRDs are automatically saved to `prds/[feature-name].md` using kebab-case naming:\n- `prds/dark-mode.md`\n- `prds/csv-export.md`\n- `prds/user-notifications.md`\n\n## Target Audience\n\nBuilt for **solo developers and small teams** who need:\n- Enterprise PM capabilities without complexity\n- Conversational interface, not command memorization\n- Intelligent routing to the right expertise\n- Progressive learning and guidance\n\n**Perfect for:**\n- Solo founders building their first product\n- Small teams without dedicated PM\n- Developers transitioning to product roles\n- Side projects and indie hackers\n\n**Not designed for:**\n- Enterprise organizations with PM teams\n- Complex stakeholder management scenarios\n- Large-scale portfolio management\n- Multiple product lines with dependencies\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** - Agent-first design and system overview\n- **[Agents](docs/agents.md)** - Complete agent reference and capabilities\n- **[Skills](docs/agent-skills.md)** - Framework knowledge and progressive disclosure\n- **[Usage](docs/usage.md)** - Patterns, workflows, and best practices\n- **[Plugins](docs/plugins.md)** - Plugin structure and organization\n\n## Inspired By\n\nThis plugin was inspired by [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents).
