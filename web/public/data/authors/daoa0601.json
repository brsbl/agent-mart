Your output must follow the exact format used by the council plugin.\n\n## Input Types\n\nYou may receive either:\n\n1. **Description-based**: A text description of who the advisor should be\n2. **Philosophy-based**: Extracted philosophies and themes from source materials\n\nThe input will specify which type via `{INPUT_TYPE}`.\n\n## Your Task\n\nGenerate a complete advisor persona in the council plugin format. The persona should:\n\n1. Feel authentic to the described figure or philosophy\n2. Have distinctive mental models and frameworks\n3. Include actionable decision-making approaches\n4. Have memorable signature phrases\n\n## Output Format\n\nYou MUST generate a **summary.md** file with this exact structure:\n\n```markdown\n# {Advisor Name} - Condensed Persona\n\n## Core Philosophy\n{2-3 sentences capturing fundamental worldview and approach.

(5-6 phrases total)\n\n## Application for Decisions\nWhen consulting {Advisor Name}, ask: {Key questions this advisor would ask about any situation}\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n### For Description-Based Creation\n\n1. Research the figure if they're real (historical or contemporary)\n2. Identify their core beliefs and frameworks\n3. Distill their thinking into mental models\n4. Capture their voice through authentic quotes or likely phrases\n\n### For Philosophy-Based Creation\n\n1. The philosophies will include extracted themes and principles\n2. Synthesize these into a coherent advisor persona\n3. Create a name if not provided (or use source author)\n4. Transform abstract principles into actionable models\n\n## Quality Criteria\n\nA good advisor persona:\n- **Distinctive**: Different from other advisors in the council\n- **Actionable**: Gives concrete frameworks, not just philosophy\n- **Authentic**: Sounds like a real person with consistent views\n- **Memorable**: Has quotable phrases and clear mental models\n- **Applicable**: Can analyze diverse questions through their lens\n\n## Style Options\n\nThe command may specify a style preference:\n\n| Style | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `practical` | Focus on actionable frameworks, less philosophy |\n| `philosophical` | Deep principles, more abstract guidance |\n| `balanced` | Mix of both (default) |\n| `contrarian` | Emphasize unconventional views and challenges |\n\nApply the specified style when generating the persona.\n\n---\n\n## INPUT\n\n**Type**: {INPUT_TYPE}\n\n**Content**:\n{INPUT_CONTENT}\n\n**Style**: {STYLE}\n\n**Advisor Name** (if provided): {ADVISOR_NAME}\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT PATH\n\nWrite the summary to: {OUTPUT_PATH}\n\nAfter writing, confirm with a brief summary of the advisor's key characteristics.\n",

Present this as a structured debate, not a bland consensus.\n\n## Conversation Context\nIf this is a **follow-up turn** (Turn > 1):\n- You have access to the previous synthesis and conversation history\n- Build on earlier insights rather than starting fresh\n- Note how advisor positions have evolved or deepened\n- Highlight any new tensions or agreements that emerged\n- Reference prior turns when relevant (\"Building on Turn 1's discussion...\")\n\n## Output Format\n\nStructure your response EXACTLY as follows:\n\n---\n\n## The Council Has Spoken\n\n### Where Advisors Agree\n[Identify the consensus points. What do most or all advisors converge on? These are likely important fundamentals.]\n\n- **[Point 1]**: [Brief explanation of shared view]\n- **[Point 2]**: [Brief explanation]\n- [Continue as needed]\n\n### Points of Tension\n\nFor each significant disagreement, present it as a debate:\n\n**Tension 1: [Name the core disagreement]**\n- **[Advisor A Name]**: [Their position, briefly]\n- **[Advisor B Name]**: [Their contrasting position]\n- **Trade-off**: [What the user is choosing between - be specific about what's gained/lost with each path]\n\n**Tension 2: [Name the disagreement]**\n- **[Advisor Name]**: [Position]\n- **[Advisor Name]**: [Contrasting position]\n- **Trade-off**: [What's at stake]\n\n[Continue for each significant tension]\n\n### Key Questions for You\nThese are the decisions that remain yours to make:\n\n1. [First key question the user must answer for themselves]\n2. [Second question]\n3. [Third question if applicable]\n\n### The Path Forward\n[2-3 sentences synthesizing the overall guidance. Not a recommendation of which advisor to follow, but clarity on what the decision actually hinges on.]\n\n---\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Highlight genuine tensions**: Don't smooth over disagreements - they're where the insight lives\n2. **Name the trade-offs**: Every choice involves giving something up; make this explicit\n3. **Stay neutral**: Don't favor one advisor over another\n4. **Be actionable**: The output should help the user decide, not just understand\n5. **Credit advisors by name**: When referencing perspectives, name which advisor said it\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT TURN\nTurn {TURN_NUMBER}\n\n## ORIGINAL QUESTION\n{USER_QUESTION}\n\n## CONVERSATION HISTORY\n{CONVERSATION_HISTORY}\n\n*(Empty if this is Turn 1)*\n\n## PREVIOUS SYNTHESIS\n{PREVIOUS_SYNTHESIS}\n\n*(Empty if this is Turn 1)*\n\n## ADVISOR RESPONSES (This Turn)\n{ADVISOR_RESPONSES}\n",

Resumption needs full context for accurate continuation\n2. Compaction happens during active sessions, not in storage\n3. Users may want to review exact advisor wording\n\n## Compaction Strategy\n\n### When to Compact\n\nTrigger compaction when estimated history exceeds ~8000 tokens (~6+ full-council turns).\n\nRough estimation:\n- Full-council turn ≈ 1200-1500 tokens (4 advisors + synthesis)\n- Solo turn ≈ 300-400 tokens\n- Threshold: ~5-6 full-council turns before compacting\n\n### What to Compact\n\nCompact all exchanges EXCEPT the 2 most recent turns. Recent context should remain in full detail.\n\n### Compaction Process\n\n1. Identify turns to compact (all but last 2)\n2. Spawn `council:history-compactor` agent\n3. Pass full exchanges to compact\n4. Receive ~500 word summary\n5. Store in `compactedHistory`\n6. Future CONVERSATION_HISTORY = compactedHistory + recent full turns\n\n### Re-compaction\n\nIf session continues and new turns accumulate, may need to re-compact:\n1. Include previous `compactedHistory` in input\n2. Add turns since last compaction (except 2 most recent)\n3. Get new unified summary\n\n## Session ID Format\n\n`council-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic-slug}-{random4}`\n\n### Topic Slug Generation\n\nExtract 2-4 key words from original question:\n- Lowercase\n- Hyphenated\n- Remove stop words (the, a, an, is, how, what, etc.)\n- Max 30 characters\n\nExamples:\n- \"Should I quit my job?\" → \"quit-job\"\n- \"How do I build wealth in my 20s?\" → \"build-wealth-20s\"\n- \"What's the best approach to position sizing?\" → \"position-sizing-approach\"\n\n### Random Suffix\n\n4 random alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9) to ensure uniqueness.\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Item | Path |\n|------|------|\n| Session files | `.claude/council/sessions/{id}.md` |\n| Example template | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/session.md.example` |\n\n## Related Components\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `council-save` command | Creates session files |\n| `council-resume` command | Loads and restores sessions |\n| `history-compactor` agent | Summarizes long histories |\n| `council-session` skill | Full session orchestration |\n",
        "skills/council-development.md": "---\nname: council-development\ndescription: Development guide for extending the council plugin - architecture patterns, file conventions, and implementation strategies\n---\n\n# Council Plugin Development Guide\n\nThis skill documents how to develop and extend the council plugin. Use this when adding features, fixing bugs, or understanding how the plugin works.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```\ncouncil/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest (version, file registry)\n├── advisors/\n│   ├── full/                # Complete persona documents (~2000 words each)\n│   └── summaries/           # Condensed personas (~300 words each)\n├── agents/                  # Subagent definitions (spawned via Task tool)\n├── commands/                # Slash commands (user-invocable)\n├── skills/                  # Documentation & orchestration guides\n└── templates/               # Example files and schemas\n```\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Orchestration Pattern\n\nThe council plugin uses **command-driven orchestration**:\n\n```\nUser invokes /council\n    ↓\nCommand reads persona summaries\n    ↓\nCommand spawns advisor agents IN PARALLEL (multiple Task calls, single message)\n    ↓\nCommand collects responses\n    ↓\nCommand spawns synthesizer agent\n    ↓\nCommand displays result + enters conversation loop\n```\n\n**Key principle**: Commands orchestrate, agents execute. Commands maintain state; agents are stateless.\n\n### 2. Template Variables\n\nAgents receive context via placeholder substitution:\n\n```markdown\n## In agent file:\n{USER_QUESTION}\n{PERSONA_SUMMARY}\n{CONVERSATION_HISTORY}\n\n## Command replaces before spawning:\nprompt: |\n  USER_QUESTION: What should I invest in?\n  PERSONA_SUMMARY: [contents of warren-buffett.md]\n  CONVERSATION_HISTORY: [built from exchanges array]\n```\n\n**Convention**: Use `{SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE}` for template variables.\n\n### 3. State Management\n\nState is tracked **mentally by the orchestrating command**, not persisted between tool calls:\n\n```typescript\n// Conceptual state (tracked in conversation context)\n{\n  selectedAdvisors: [\"warren-buffett\", \"charlie-munger\"],\n  turnNumber: 3,\n  exchanges: [...],\n  compactedHistory: \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nFor persistence across sessions, state is serialized to markdown files with YAML frontmatter.\n\n### 4. Parallel Execution\n\n**Critical**: Always spawn multiple advisor agents in a single message:\n\n```markdown\n// CORRECT - parallel execution\nUse Task tool to spawn warren-buffett advisor\nUse Task tool to spawn charlie-munger advisor\nUse Task tool to spawn howard-marks advisor\n[All in same message → runs in parallel]\n\n// WRONG - sequential execution\nUse Task tool to spawn warren-buffett advisor\n[Wait for response]\nUse Task tool to spawn charlie-munger advisor\n[Wait for response]\n```\n\n## File Conventions\n\n### Commands (`commands/*.md`)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: command-name           # Invoked as /council:command-name\ndescription: Brief description for discovery\nargs:\n  - name: arg_name\n    description: What this argument does\n    required: false          # or true\n---\n\n# Command Title\n\nInstructions for Claude to execute when command is invoked.\n\n## Process\n### Step 1: ...\n### Step 2: ...\n\n## Notes\n- Important implementation details\n```\n\n**Naming**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `council-save.md`)\n\n### Agents (`agents/*.md`)\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: agent-name\ndescription: What this agent does (shown in Task tool descriptions)\nmodel: sonnet                # or opus for complex tasks\ntools:\n  - Read                     # Only tools the agent needs\n---\n\n# Agent Title\n\nRole description and task instructions.\n\n## Output Format\nExact structure the agent should return.\n\n## Guidelines\n1.

Create full persona: `advisors/full/New Advisor.md`\n2. Create summary: `advisors/summaries/new-advisor.md`\n3. Add to @mention aliases in `commands/council.md` (if built-in)\n4. Update `commands/list.md` to show new advisor\n\n### Adding a New Command\n\n1. Create `commands/new-command.md` with frontmatter\n2. Add to `plugin.json` commands array\n3. Update related skills to document the command\n4. Add to `commands/list.md` if user-facing\n\n### Adding a New Agent\n\n1. Create `agents/new-agent.md` with frontmatter\n2. Add to `plugin.json` agents array\n3. Document in relevant skills\n4. Update commands that will spawn this agent\n\n### Modifying Conversation Flow\n\nThe conversation loop lives in `commands/council.md` (Step 7). Key sections:\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| Display Continue Prompt | Shows user their options |\n| Parse User Input | Routes to correct handler |\n| @Mention Parsing | Maps aliases to advisor IDs |\n| Full Council Follow-up | All advisors + synthesis |\n| Solo Advisor Mode | Single @mentioned advisor |\n| Exit Handling | Save prompt + cleanup |\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Reading Persona Before Spawning\n\n```markdown\n1. Read persona summary from appropriate path\n2. Store content\n3. Spawn agent with PERSONA_SUMMARY: [stored content]\n```\n\n### Building Conversation History\n\n```markdown\nCONVERSATION_HISTORY:\n\n### Turn 1 - Initial Question\n**Q**: [question]\n**Warren Buffett**: [summary]\n**Charlie Munger**: [summary]\n**Synthesis**: [key points]\n\n### Turn 2 - Follow-up\n...\n```\n\n### Handling Compaction\n\n```markdown\nIf turnNumber > 5 AND no recent compaction:\n  1. Spawn history-compactor with old exchanges\n  2. Store result in compactedHistory\n  3. Future history = compactedHistory + recent 2 turns\n```\n\n### Session Persistence\n\n```markdown\nSave:\n  1. Generate ID: council-{date}-{topic}-{random}\n  2. Build YAML frontmatter (metadata)\n  3. Build markdown body (full exchanges)\n  4. Write to .claude/council/sessions/{id}.md\n\nResume:\n  1. Read session file\n  2. Parse frontmatter → restore metadata\n  3. Parse body → reconstruct exchanges\n  4. Enter conversation loop with restored state\n```\n\n## Testing Changes\n\n### Manual Testing Checklist\n\n1. **Initial flow**: `/council` → select advisors → get synthesis\n2. **Follow-up**: Type question → all advisors respond with context\n3. **Solo mode**: `@warren question` → single conversational response\n4. **Save**: `/council:save` → file created correctly\n5. **Resume**: `/council:resume` → context restored, loop continues\n6. **Exit**: `exit` → save prompt appears\n\n### Edge Cases to Verify\n\n- [ ] @mention for advisor not in session → helpful error\n- [ ] Long conversations (6+ turns) → compaction triggers\n- [ ] Resume with missing advisor → graceful degradation\n- [ ] Empty follow-up → prompt for question\n- [ ] Save twice → updates existing file\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\n### Agent Not Receiving Context\n\nCheck that the command is:\n1. Reading the persona summary BEFORE spawning\n2. Including all template variables in the prompt\n3. Using exact variable names from agent file\n\n### Conversation History Missing\n\nVerify:\n1. Exchanges array is being updated after each turn\n2. History builder iterates all exchanges\n3. Compaction isn't dropping recent turns\n\n### Parallel Execution Not Working\n\nEnsure all Task tool calls are in a **single message**. If responses come back sequentially, they're being called sequentially.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version | Changes |\n|---------|---------|\n| 1.0.0 | Initial council with parallel advisors + synthesis |\n| 2.0.0 | Custom councils, advisor creation from sources |\n| 3.0.0 | Continuous conversation, @mentions, persistence |\n\n## Key Files Reference\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `commands/council.md` | Main orchestration, conversation loop |\n| `agents/advisor.md` | Standard advisor response format |\n| `agents/advisor-solo.md` | Conversational @mention responses |\n| `agents/synthesizer.md` | Combines advisor perspectives |\n| `agents/history-compactor.md` | Summarizes long histories |\n| `skills/council-session.md` | Full session documentation |\n| `skills/conversation-state.md` | State structure and persistence |\n| `templates/session.md.example` | Example saved session format |\n",
        "skills/council-session.md": "---\nname: council-session\ndescription: Invoke the council of advisors skill when users want multiple perspectives on a decision, need advice from investor/entrepreneur mindsets, or explicitly ask for \"council\" or \"advisors\". Supports continuous conversation with full context.\n---\n\n# Council Session Skill\n\nThis skill orchestrates a council of AI advisors - personas of famous investors, entrepreneurs, or custom personas - to analyze questions and present structured debate.\n\n**NEW**: Council now supports continuous conversation. After initial synthesis, users can ask follow-up questions, address specific advisors directly with @mentions, and save/resume sessions across time.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when the user:\n- Wants multiple perspectives on a decision\n- Is considering a major life/career/business decision\n- Asks for \"council\", \"advisors\", or \"what would X think\"\n- Needs to weigh trade-offs between different approaches\n- Wants advice from an investor or entrepreneur mindset\n\n## Dynamic Advisor Detection\n\n**First**: Check if the project has custom councils configured at `.claude/council/councils.yaml`\n\n**If project councils exist**:\n1. Read the councils.yaml to get available councils\n2. Offer council selection before advisor selection\n3. Support both custom and `builtin:` prefixed advisors\n\n**If no project councils**:\n1. Use the 10 built-in advisors\n2. Suggest `/council:create-council` for future customization\n\n## Available Built-in Advisors\n\n| Advisor | Primary Focus | Best For |\n|---------|--------------|----------|\n| **charlie-munger** | Mental Models & Inversion | Avoiding mistakes, seeing blind spots |\n| **warren-buffett** | Value & Long-term Thinking | Investment decisions, patience |\n| **ray-dalio** | Principles & Systems | Process design, stress testing |\n| **howard-marks** | Risk & Market Cycles | Risk assessment, timing |\n| **steve-jobs** | Focus & Elimination | Product decisions, prioritization |\n| **jeff-bezos** | Customer & Long-term | Strategy, reversible vs irreversible |\n| **elon-musk** | First Principles | Challenging assumptions, innovation |\n| **ed-thorp** | Quantitative Edge | Position sizing, risk management |\n| **jim-simons** | Data & Statistics | Evidence-based decisions |\n| **cliff-asness** | Factor Investing | Systematic approaches, drawdowns |\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Project Detection**: Check for `.claude/council/councils.yaml`\n2. **Council Selection** (if applicable): User chooses a council or built-ins\n3. **Question Gathering**: Get the user's question or situation\n4. **Advisor Selection**: User selects 3-5 advisors from chosen council\n5. **Parallel Analysis**: Each advisor analyzes independently (run in parallel)\n6. **Synthesis**: A synthesizer combines perspectives into structured debate\n7. **Presentation**: User receives agreements, tensions, and trade-offs\n\n## Running a Council Session\n\n### Step 1: Detect Project Councils\n\nCheck if `.claude/council/councils.yaml` exists. If it does:\n- Parse the YAML to get available councils\n- Note the default council if set\n\n### Step 2: Council Selection (if applicable)\n\nIf project councils exist, use AskUserQuestion to let user choose:\n- Each custom council with its description\n- \"Use built-in advisors\" option\n\n### Step 3: Gather the Question\n\nAsk the user clearly what decision or question they're facing. Get enough context to give advisors something to work with.\n\n### Step 4: Select Advisors\n\nPresent advisors from the chosen council (or all built-ins). Let user select 3-5 advisors.\n\n### Step 5: Read Persona Summaries\n\nFor each selected advisor, read their condensed summary:\n\n| Type | Path |\n|------|------|\n| Built-in | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/advisors/summaries/{name}.md` |\n| Custom | `.claude/council/advisors/{name}/summary.md` |\n\n### Step 6: Run Advisors in Parallel\n\n**Critical**: Spawn all advisor agents simultaneously using multiple Task calls in a single message.\n\nEach Task should use subagent_type `council:advisor` with:\n- The persona summary content\n- Path to full persona for reference\n- The user's question\n\n### Step 7: Synthesize\n\nOnce all responses return, spawn the synthesizer agent (`council:synthesizer`) with:\n- Original question\n- All advisor responses labeled by name\n\n### Step 8: Present Results\n\nDisplay the structured debate with:\n- **Where Advisors Agree** - Consensus points\n- **Points of Tension** - Disagreements with trade-offs\n- **Key Questions** - Decisions the user must make\n\n## Example Session with Custom Council\n\n**User**: \"Should I quit my job to start a company?\"\n\n**Project has**: `stoic-philosophers` council with marcus-aurelius, seneca, builtin:charlie-munger\n\n**Flow**:\n1. Detect custom council\n2. User selects \"stoic-philosophers\"\n3. User selects all 3 advisors\n4. Run parallel analysis\n5. Synthesize with Stoic + Munger perspectives\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Built-in\n- Summaries: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/advisors/summaries/*.md`\n- Full personas: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/advisors/full/*.md`\n\n### Project-level\n- Config: `.claude/council/councils.yaml`\n- Custom advisors: `.claude/council/advisors/{name}/summary.md`\n- Philosophies: `.claude/council/philosophies/*.md`\n\n### Agents\n- Advisor agent: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/advisor.md`\n- Synthesizer: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/synthesizer.md`\n- Advisor creator: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/advisor-creator.md`\n- Philosophy extractor: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/philosophy-extractor.md`\n\n## Related Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/council` | Start a council session |\n| `/council:list` | Show available councils and advisors |\n| `/council:create-council` | Create a named council |\n| `/council:create-advisor` | Create advisor from description |\n| `/council:synthesize` | Create advisor from source materials |\n| `/council:save` | Save current conversation to file |\n| `/council:resume` | Resume a saved conversation |\n| `/council:end` | End conversation with save prompt |\n\n---\n\n## Session State Management\n\nThroughout a council session, maintain this state mentally:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CouncilSession {\n  id: string;                    // Generated on save\n  startedAt: string;             // ISO timestamp\n  selectedAdvisors: string[];    // e.g., [\"warren-buffett\", \"charlie-munger\"]\n  councilName?: string;          // If using custom council\n  turnNumber: number;            // Starts at 1\n  exchanges: Exchange[];         // All Q&A exchanges\n  compactedHistory?: string;     // Summarized old turns (when needed)\n  compactionThreshold: number;   // Default: ~8000 tokens\n}\n\ninterface Exchange {\n  turn: number;\n  timestamp: string;\n  type: \"full-council\" | \"solo-advisor\";\n  question: string;\n  targetAdvisor?: string;        // For solo mode only\n  advisorResponses: {\n    advisor: string;\n    response: string;\n  }[];\n  synthesis?: string;            // For full-council only\n}\n```\n\n## Conversation Loop\n\nAfter the initial council synthesis, enter a conversation loop:\n\n### 1. Display Continue Prompt\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n💬 Continue the conversation:\n   • Type a follow-up question → All advisors respond + synthesis\n   • @advisor question → Direct response from one advisor only\n   • /council:save → Save this conversation for later\n   • exit → End session (with save prompt)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n```\n\n### 2. Parse User Input\n\n| Input | Action |\n|-------|--------|\n| `exit` / `quit` / `done` | Offer save, then exit |\n| `/council:save` | Save to file, continue loop |\n| `@advisor question` | Solo advisor response |\n| Anything else | Full council follow-up |\n\n### 3. Build Conversation History\n\nFor follow-ups, build a history string:\n\n```markdown\n## CONVERSATION HISTORY\n\n### Turn 1 - Initial Question\n**Q**: [original question]\n\n**Warren Buffett**: [key insight summary]\n**Charlie Munger**: [key insight summary]\n\n**Synthesis**: [main points]\n\n### Turn 2 - Follow-up\n**Q**: [follow-up question]\n...\n```\n\n### 4. Handle Compaction\n\nWhen conversation history grows large (~6+ turns, ~8000 tokens):\n\n1. Spawn `council:history-compactor` agent\n2. Pass it all exchanges except the most recent 2\n3. Get back a ~500 word summary\n4. Store in `compactedHistory`\n5. Use compacted + recent for future context\n\n### 5. Follow-up Modes\n\n**Full Council Mode** (default):\n- Run all selected advisors in parallel\n- Each receives CONVERSATION_HISTORY + TURN_NUMBER + new question\n- Run synthesizer with previous synthesis context\n- Store exchange in state\n\n**Solo Advisor Mode** (@mention):\n- Parse @mention to identify advisor\n- Verify advisor is in current session\n- Spawn single `council:advisor-solo` agent\n- Get conversational response (no rigid structure)\n- Store exchange in state\n\n### 6. Loop\n\nAfter each response, display continue prompt and wait for next input.\n\n## @Mention Aliases\n\n| Aliases | Advisor ID |\n|---------|------------|\n| @warren, @buffett | warren-buffett |\n| @charlie, @munger | charlie-munger |\n| @howard, @marks | howard-marks |\n| @ray, @dalio | ray-dalio |\n| @steve, @jobs | steve-jobs |\n| @jeff, @bezos | jeff-bezos |\n| @elon, @musk | elon-musk |\n| @ed, @thorp | ed-thorp |\n| @jim, @simons | jim-simons |\n| @cliff, @asness | cliff-asness |\n\nCustom advisors: Use `@{advisor-id}` exactly as defined.\n\n## Session Persistence\n\nSessions can be saved to `.claude/council/sessions/{id}.md` with:\n- YAML frontmatter (metadata)\n- Markdown body (full conversation)\n\nSee `/council:save` and `/council:resume` commands.\n",
        "skills/council-setup.md": "---\nname: council-setup\ndescription: Guides first-time project setup for custom councils\n---\n\n# Council Setup Guide\n\nThis skill guides users through setting up custom councils for their project.\n\n## When to Use\n\nInvoke this skill when:\n- User wants to set up custom councils for the first time\n- User asks \"how do I create custom advisors?\"\n- User wants to understand the council plugin's customization options\n- User mentions wanting project-specific advisors\n\n## Project Setup Overview\n\nThe council plugin stores project-specific configuration in:\n\n```\n<project>/.claude/council/\n├── councils.yaml              # Registry of councils\n├── advisors/                  # Custom advisor personas\n│   └── <advisor-name>/\n│       ├── summary.md         # Quick reference (required)\n│       └── full.md            # Deep persona (optional)\n└── philosophies/              # Extracted philosophies (intermediate)\n    └── <source-name>.md\n```\n\n## Setup Flow\n\n### Quick Setup (use built-in advisors only)\n\nIf you just want to use the built-in advisors with custom groupings:\n\n1. Run `/council:create-council` to create a named group\n2. Select from the 10 built-in advisors\n3. Run `/council` to use your new council\n\n### Custom Advisor Setup\n\nIf you want to create entirely new advisor personas:\n\n**Option A: From Description**\n1. Run `/council:create-advisor`\n2. Describe the advisor you want to create\n3. Refine the generated persona\n4. Add to a council with `/council:create-council`\n\n**Option B: From Source Materials**\n1. Run `/council:synthesize path/to/source.pdf`\n2. Review extracted philosophies and themes\n3. Select which themes to include\n4. Refine the generated advisor persona\n5.
