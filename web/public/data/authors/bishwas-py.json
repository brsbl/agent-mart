        "README.md": "# Forge\n\nUniversal dev workflow plugin for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com). Auto-detects your stack, orchestrates the full development lifecycle from task pickup to merged PR — works on any project, any language.\n\n<img width=\"124\" height=\"124\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f57b96e-5869-4876-b30a-5bd2cbcabc4c\" />\n\n\n## Install\n\nFirst, add the marketplace:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add Bishwas-py/forge\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install forge\n```\n\nTo update to the latest version:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace update\n```\n\n## What It Does\n\nForge handles the full dev loop:\n\n1. **Read current state** — git status, open PRs, tasks (Linear or GitHub Issues)\n2. **Pick a task** — fetch backlog, rank by impact + complexity, you decide\n3. **Detect project** — scan files, infer stack, confirm with you, remember it\n4. **Fill gaps** — missing linter/tests/CI? recommend setup, you decide\n5. **Create branch** — follows your naming convention\n6. **Develop** — code across repos, respects stored hard rules\n7. **Pre-PR gate** — lint, test, E2E, security, self-review\n8. **Create PR** — `gh pr create` with description + task reference\n9. **Review cycle** — CodeRabbit/reviewer comments, fix, get approval\n10. **Merge** — merge, deploy (if configured), Linear auto-updates\n\n## Recommended Plugins\n\nClaude Code does not yet support formal plugin dependencies ([tracking issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9444)). Forge adapts to what you have installed — it skips phases that lack their required plugin rather than failing.\n\nThat said, you'll get the most out of Forge with these installed:\n\n### Core (strongly recommended)\n\n| Plugin | Used for | Install |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| **linear** | Task fetching, status updates, project mapping | `claude plugin install linear` |\n| **github** | PR creation, CI checks, review comments | `claude plugin install github` |\n\n### Quality & development\n\n| Plugin | Used for | Install |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| **feature-dev** | Structured development, code architecture | `claude plugin install feature-dev` |\n| **code-simplifier** | Pre-PR code cleanup | `claude plugin install code-simplifier` |\n| **playwright** | E2E visual verification | `claude plugin install playwright` |\n| **frontend-design** | UI/component work | `claude plugin install frontend-design` |\n\n## How It Works Without Plugins\n\nForge degrades gracefully:\n\n- No `linear`? — Fall back to GitHub Issues via `gh`, or skip task selection entirely\n- No `github`? — Skip PR creation, just run the pre-PR gate\n- No `feature-dev`? — Develop without structured codebase analysis\n- No `frontend-design`? — Develop UI without design-focused guidance\n- No `playwright`? — Skip E2E visual checks\n- No `code-simplifier`? — Skip automated cleanup, rely on self-review only\n\nThe core value — stack detection, knowledge persistence, pre-PR quality gate — works with zero plugins.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
