        "README.md": "# ATDD — Acceptance Test Driven Development for Claude Code\n\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\n[![Claude Code Plugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude%20Code-Plugin-blueviolet)](https://github.com/swingerman/atdd)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-green)](https://github.com/swingerman/atdd)\n\nA [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) plugin that enforces the **Acceptance Test Driven Development** (ATDD) methodology when building software with AI. Write human-readable Given/When/Then specs before code, generate project-specific test pipelines, and maintain the discipline of two-stream testing.\n\n**Inspired by [Robert C. Martin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) (Uncle Bob) acceptance test approach from [empire-2025](https://github.com/unclebob/empire-2025).** The ideas, methodology, and key insights in this plugin come directly from his work and public writings on Spec Driven Design (SDD) and ATDD.\n\n## Why ATDD with AI?\n\nWhen using AI to write code, two problems emerge:\n\n1. **AI writes code without constraints** — without acceptance tests anchoring behavior, AI can \"willy-nilly plop code around\" (Uncle Bob's words) and write unit tests that pass but don't verify the right behavior.\n2. **Implementation details leak into specs** — AI naturally tries to fill Given/When/Then statements with class names, API endpoints, and database tables instead of domain language.\n\nThis plugin solves both problems by enforcing the ATDD workflow and guarding against implementation leakage. The result: **two test streams** (acceptance + unit) that constrain AI development, producing better-structured, more reliable code.\n\n> \"The two different streams of tests cause Claude to think much more deeply about the structure of the code. It can't just willy-nilly plop code around and write a unit test for it. It is also constrained by the structure of the acceptance tests.\"\n> — Robert C. Martin\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\n1. Write Given/When/Then specs (natural language, domain-only)\n                    ↓\n2. Generate test pipeline (parser → IR → test generator)\n   Pipeline has DEEP knowledge of your codebase internals\n                    ↓\n3. Run acceptance tests → they FAIL (red)\n                    ↓\n4. Implement with TDD (unit tests + code) until BOTH streams pass\n                    ↓\n5. Review specs for implementation leakage\n                    ↓\n6. Iterate — next feature, back to step 1\n```\n\nThe generated pipeline is NOT like Cucumber. It's what Uncle Bob calls \"a strange hybrid of Cucumber and the test fixtures\" — the parser/generator has **deep knowledge of your system's internals** and produces complete, runnable tests. No manual fixture code needed.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace and install the plugin:\n\n```shell\n/plugin marketplace add swingerman/atdd\n/plugin install atdd@swingerman-atdd\n```\n\nOr test locally by cloning:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/swingerman/atdd.git\nclaude --plugin-dir ./atdd\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Start the ATDD workflow\n\n```\n/atdd:atdd Add user authentication with email and password\n```\n\nClaude will guide you through understanding the feature, then help you write acceptance specs.\n\n### 2. Write your first spec\n\nCreate a file in `specs/` at your project root:\n\n```\n;===============================================================\n; User can register with email and password.\n;===============================================================\nGIVEN no registered users.\n\nWHEN a user registers with email \"bob@example.com\" and password \"secret123\".\n\nTHEN there is 1 registered user.\nTHEN the user \"bob@example.com\" can log in.\n```\n\n### 3. Generate the test pipeline\n\nClaude analyzes your codebase and generates a project-specific parser, IR format, and test generator tailored to your language and test framework (pytest, Jest, JUnit, Go testing, RSpec, etc.).\n\n### 4. Red → Green → Refactor\n\nRun the acceptance tests (they should fail), then implement with TDD until both acceptance tests AND unit tests pass.\n\n### 5. Check for leakage\n\n```\n/atdd:spec-check\n```\n\nThe spec-guardian agent reviews your specs for implementation details that shouldn't be there.\n\n## GWT Spec Format\n\nSpecs use an opinionated, human-readable Given/When/Then format:\n\n```\n;===============================================================\n; Description of the behavior being specified.\n;===============================================================\nGIVEN [precondition in domain language].\n\nWHEN [action the user/system takes].\n\nTHEN [observable outcome].\n```\n\n### The Golden Rule: External Observables Only\n\nSpecs must describe what the system does, not how it does it:\n\n| Bad (implementation leakage) | Good (domain language) |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| `GIVEN the UserService has an empty userRepository.` | `GIVEN there are no registered users.` |\n| `WHEN a POST request is sent to /api/users with JSON body.` | `WHEN a new user registers with email \"bob@example.com\".` |\n| `THEN the database contains 1 row in the users table.` | `THEN there is 1 registered user.` |\n\n> \"Specs will be co-authored by the humans and the AI, but with final approval, ferociously defended, by the humans.\"\n> — Robert C. Martin\n\n## Plugin Components\n\n| Component | Name | Purpose |\n|-----------|------|---------|\n| Skill | `atdd` | Core 7-step ATDD workflow: specs → pipeline → red/green → iterate |\n| Agent | `spec-guardian` | Catches implementation leakage in Given/When/Then statements |\n| Agent | `pipeline-builder` | Generates bespoke parser → IR → test generator for your project |\n| Command | `/atdd:atdd` | Start the ATDD workflow for a new feature |\n| Command | `/atdd:spec-check` | Audit specs for implementation leakage |\n| Hook | PreToolUse | Soft warning when writing code without acceptance specs |\n| Hook | Stop | Reminder to verify both test streams pass |\n\n## Key Principles\n\nThese principles from Uncle Bob's writings are encoded in the plugin:\n\n- **\"Just enough specs for this sprint\"** — Don't write all specs upfront. Spec the current feature, implement it, iterate. Avoid Big Up-Front Design.\n- **\"Two test streams constrain development\"** — Acceptance tests define WHAT (external behavior), unit tests define HOW (internal structure). Both must pass.\n- **\"Specs describe only external observables\"** — No class names, API endpoints, database tables, or framework terms in specs. Domain language only.\n- **\"Co-authored by humans and AI, ferociously defended by humans\"** — Claude proposes specs, you approve them. Always.\n- **\"Small steps\"** — Whether your sprint is a day, an hour, or a microsecond, the same rules apply.\n\n## What This Is NOT\n\n- **Not Cucumber.** The generated pipeline has deep knowledge of your system's internals. No generic fixture layer that requires manual glue code.\n- **Not a template library.** Claude analyzes your project fresh every time and generates a bespoke pipeline for your language, framework, and codebase.\n- **Not Big Up-Front Design.** Write just enough specs for the current feature. Iterate.\n\n## Works With Any Language\n\nThe pipeline-builder agent analyzes your project and generates the parser/generator in your project's language and test framework. Tested approaches include Python/pytest, TypeScript/Jest, Java/JUnit, Go/testing, Ruby/RSpec, Clojure/Speclj, and more.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis plugin is an implementation of Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob) Acceptance Test Driven Development and Spec Driven Design methodology for Claude Code. The approach, insights, and principles come from:\n\n- [empire-2025](https://github.com/unclebob/empire-2025) — Uncle Bob's project where this approach was developed and refined\n- His public writings and tweets on ATDD, SDD, and AI-assisted development\n\nThis plugin does not contain any code from empire-2025. It adapts the methodology for use as a Claude Code plugin.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
