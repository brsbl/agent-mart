GitHub CLI authentication can be verified with:\n\n```bash\ngh auth status\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAgentize is an AI-powered SDK that helps you build your software projects\nusing Claude Code powerfully. It is splitted into two main components:\n\n1. **Claude Code Plugin**: Automatically registered during installation when `claude` CLI is available.\n   See [Tutorial 00a: Claude UI Setup](./docs/tutorial/00a-claude-ui-setup.md) for details.\n2. **CLI Tool**: A source-first CLI tool to help you manage your projects using Agentize.\n   See [Tutorial 00: CLI Quickstart](./docs/tutorial/00-cli-quickstart.md) for the CLI workflow.\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/main/scripts/install | bash\n```\n\nThen add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):\n\n```bash\nsource $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh\n```\n\nSee [docs/feat/cli/install.md](./docs/feat/cli/install.md) for installation options and troubleshooting.\n\n**Upgrade:** Run `lol upgrade` to pull the latest changes.\n\n## Your First 15 Minutes\n\nAfter installation, the installer creates `~/.agentize.local.yaml` in your home folder. This file controls which AI backends are used for planning and implementation.\n\n### The 5-Step Agentize CLI Workflow\n\n1. **Configure** (already done) - confirm `~/.agentize.local.yaml` exists and adjust backends if needed\n\n2. **Clone** with worktrees:\n   ```bash\n   wt clone https://github.com/org/repo.git myproject.git\n   ```\n   `wt clone` sets up a bare repository and leaves you in `trees/main`.\n\n3. **Plan** your first feature:\n   ```bash\n   lol plan --editor\n   ```\n   Review the GitHub issue it creates.\n\n4. **Implement** the plan:\n   ```bash\n   lol impl <issue-number>\n   ```\n\n5. **Navigate** between worktrees:\n   ```bash\n   wt goto <issue-number>\n   wt goto main\n   ```\n\nSee [Tutorial 00: CLI Quickstart](./docs/tutorial/00-cli-quickstart.md) for a full walkthrough.\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you encounter any issue during the usage. For example:\n1. It asks you for permission on a really simple operation.\n2. It fails to automatically continue on a session.\n\nEnable debug mode in your `.agentize.local.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nhandsoff:\n  debug: true\n```\n\nThen re-run the command. This will give you a detailed log in either\n- `/path/to/your/project/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log` or\n- `$HOME/.agentize/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log`\nPaste your logs on issue for me (@were) to debug!\n\nFor further help, please visit our [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshoot.md).\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nMinimizing human intervention by artifact centric.\n- Session-centric: People tell AI what to do, and wait until it ends.\n  Then give feedback until they are satisfied. Human looping in too much\n  limits the scalability.\n- Artifact-centric: People tell AI what to do, and AI produces a plan first.\n  Plan is the ONLY phase that human can intervene. After the plan is approved,\n  AI will execute the plan and produce the code merge for human to review.\n\nA clear separation between human, AI, and formal language.\n- Humans are for the intention of development, including providing feature requirements,\n  approving plans, and code merges.\n- AI is the worker of software development for both making the plan, and maintaining the codebase,\n  including tests, documentation, and code quality.\n- Formal language is for the coordination and orchestration between AI, and other systems,\n  e.g. Github Issues, Pull Requests, and CI/CD pipelines.\n  - I (@were) found that skills are promising for AI to synthesize fixed code to interact with such\n    systems, but these flows are more fixed and formal than I expected --- putting them in formal\n    language (e.g. Python scripts, or YAML configuration) is more transparent and faster to execute\n    the whole workflow.\n\n### Workflow:\n\nSee our detailed workflow diagrams:\n\n- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning\n- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/feat/core/issue-to-impl.md) - Complete development cycle\n\n**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nLearn Agentize in 15 minutes with our step-by-step tutorials (3-5 min each):\n\n1. **[CLI Quickstart](./docs/tutorial/00-cli-quickstart.md)** - Learn the core CLI workflow in 15 minutes\n2. **[Claude UI Setup](./docs/tutorial/00a-claude-ui-setup.md)** - Set up the Claude Code plugin and slash commands\n3. **[Ultra Planner](./docs/tutorial/01-ultra-planner.md)** - Primary planning tutorial (recommended)\n4. **[Issue to Implementation](./docs/tutorial/02-issue-to-impl.md)** - Complete development cycle with `/issue-to-impl` and `/code-review`\n5. **[Advanced Usage](./docs/tutorial/03-advanced-usage.md)** - Scale up with parallel development workflows\n\n## Project Organization\n\n```plaintext\nagentize/\n├── .claude-plugin/         # Plugin root (use with --plugin-dir)\n│   ├── marketplace.json    # Plugin manifest\n│   ├── commands/           # Claude Code commands\n│   ├── skills/             # Claude Code skills\n│   ├── agents/             # Claude Code agents\n│   └── hooks/              # Claude Code hooks\n├── python/                 # Python modules (agentize.*)\n├── docs/                   # Documentation\n│   └── git-msg-tags.md     # Commit message conventions\n├── src/cli/                # Source-first CLI libraries\n│   ├── wt.sh               # Worktree CLI library\n│   └── lol.sh              # SDK CLI library\n├── scripts/                # Shell scripts and wrapper entrypoints\n├── templates/              # Templates for SDK generation\n├── tests/                  # Test cases\n├── Makefile                # Build targets for testing and setup\n└── README.md               # This readme file\n```\n"
