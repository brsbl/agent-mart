        "README.md": "# Hugging Face Skills (with Brightdata support)\n\nThis project is an extension of the [Hugging Face Skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills) project. Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like Claude Code. This repository includes a new skill for Bright Data to interact with the web and perform various tasks.\n\nThe Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.\n\n## How do Skills work?\n\nIn practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active.\n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following commands to test it out yourself:\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\n\n2. Install skills:\n```bash\nbash scripts/link-skills.sh\n```\n\n3. Run Claude Code:\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\n4. Verify skills:\n\n```bash\n/skills\n```\n\nFollow the following blog post for more information:\n\n- [We Got Claude to Fine-Tune an Open Source LLM](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-skills-training)\n\n## Skills\n\nThis repository has the following skills:\n\n### Available skills\n\n<!-- This table is auto-generated by scripts/generate_agents.py.

Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf-datasets/`) and rename it.\n2. Update the new folder's `SKILL.md` frontmatter:\n\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   name: my-skill-name\n   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it\n   ---\n\n   # Skill Title\n\n   Guidance + examples + guardrails\n   ```\n\n3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.\n4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.\n5. Run `python scripts/generate_agents.py` to validate the structure.\n6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.\n\n### Marketplace\n\nThe `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.\n\n### Additional references\n\n- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).\n- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.\n- Review [Bright Data documentation](https://docs.brightdata.com/) for anything related to Bright Data.\n\n## 📬 Stay Updated with Our Newsletter!\n\n**Get a FREE Data Science eBook** 📖 with 150+ essential lessons in Data Science when you subscribe to our newsletter!
