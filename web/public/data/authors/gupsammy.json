        "README.md": "# Claudest\n\nA curated Claude Code plugin marketplace. Everything here is something I personally use, build, and iterate on across real projects. If it's in this marketplace, it works.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace, then install any plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add gupsammy/claudest\n/plugin install claude-memory@claudest\n```\n\nTo enable auto-updates, run `/plugin`, go to the Marketplaces tab, and toggle auto-update for Claudest.\n\n## Plugins\n\n### claude-memory\n\nConversation memory for Claude Code. Recall what happened yesterday, last week, or three weeks ago.\n\nLLMs don't carry anything forward between sessions. Every conversation starts blank. Claude Code gives agents core memory (CLAUDE.md files loaded every session), procedural memory (skills and tool definitions), and archival memory (auto memory notes the agent writes for itself). What was missing: recall memory. The ability to search and retrieve actual past conversations.\n\nThat's what claude-memory provides. It stores every session in a SQLite database with full-text search (FTS5, BM25 ranking, zero external dependencies) and makes past conversations available to the agent in two ways.\n\nFirst, automatic context injection. On every session start, a hook queries recent sessions and injects the most recent meaningful one into context. The agent already knows what you worked on last time before you say a word. This is what makes the plan-in-one-session, implement-in-the-next workflow possible.\n\nSecond, on-demand search. A past-conversations skill lets the agent (or you) search conversation history by keywords, browse recent sessions, or run structured analyses like retrospectives and gap-finding. Ask \"what did we decide about the API design?\" and the agent searches your history.\n\nThe search works because the agent constructs the queries, not you. When you ask about \"the database migration,\" the agent extracts the right keywords, sends them to FTS5, and iterates if the first results aren't good enough. The agent compensates for the simplicity of the storage layer. No vector database, no embedding pipeline, no external dependencies. Just SQLite and Python's standard library.\n\nThe plugin also includes an extract-learnings skill, a route from recall into archival memory. It reads past conversations, identifies non-obvious insights and gotchas worth preserving, and proposes placing them at the right layer in the memory hierarchy (CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, or topic files) with diffs and rationale. Learnings that would otherwise evaporate when context resets get distilled into persistent knowledge.\n\nFor the full story behind the architecture, I wrote about the design decisions and what I learned about how agents actually use memory: [What I Learned Building a Memory System for My Coding Agent](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r1w397/comment/o5294lk/).\n\n```\n/plugin install claude-memory@claudest\n```\n\n---\n\n### claude-utilities\n\nUseful tools that don't fit in a specific plugin.\n\nCurrently includes **web-to-markdown**, which converts any webpage to clean markdown, stripping ads, navigation, popups, and cookie banners. Uses [ezycopy](https://github.com/gupsammy/EzyCopy) under the hood.\n\n```bash\n# Prerequisite\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gupsammy/EzyCopy/main/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nTriggers on \"convert this page to markdown\", \"extract this webpage\", \"save this article\", \"grab content from URL\", \"scrape this page\".\n\n```\n/plugin install claude-utilities@claudest\n```\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is a curated set of tools I personally maintain, not an open-submission marketplace. If you find bugs or have suggestions, open an issue. If you want to run your own marketplace with your own battle-tested tools, fork this and make it yours.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "plugins/claude-memory/README.md": "# claude-memory\n\nSearchable conversation memory for Claude Code. Auto-syncs sessions to a SQLite database with full-text search, injects previous session context on startup, and provides on-demand recall of past conversations.\n\n## Why\n\nAgents don't remember anything between sessions. Claude Code gives them core memory (CLAUDE.md), procedural memory (skills, tools), and archival memory (auto memory notes). But there was no recall memory: the ability to search and retrieve the actual conversations from previous sessions.\n\nclaude-memory fills that gap. It stores conversation history in SQLite with FTS5 full-text search, makes it available through automatic context injection and on-demand search, and provides a skill that distills learnings from past conversations into persistent knowledge. Zero external dependencies. Just Python's standard library and SQLite.\n\n## Requirements\n\nPython 3.7+ (stdlib only, no pip packages needed)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add gupsammy/claudest\n/plugin install claude-memory@claudest\n```\n\nEverything runs automatically from there. Sessions sync on stop, context injects on start, and search is always available when you need to look back.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Automatic context injection\n\nOn every session start, a hook queries the database for recent sessions from the same project. It selects the most recent meaningful one (skipping noise like single-exchange sessions, collecting short ones but continuing to look for something substantial). The agent begins every conversation knowing what happened in the previous one: what files were modified, what was discussed, where things left off.\n\nThis is what makes the plan-in-one-session, implement-in-the-next workflow possible. Without context injection, clearing context means starting over. With it, the agent picks up where you left off automatically.\n\n### On-demand search\n\nThe past-conversations skill provides two tools: keyword search (FTS5 with BM25 ranking) and chronological session browsing. The agent invokes these during a session when it needs to look something up. It also includes a lens system for structured analysis: restore context, find knowledge gaps, run retrospectives, extract decisions.\n\nThe skill triggers naturally on phrases like \"what did we discuss,\" \"remember when we worked on,\" \"continue where we left off,\" and \"as I mentioned before.\"\n\nThe search works because the agent constructs the queries, not the user. When you ask about \"the database migration,\" the agent extracts substantive keywords and sends them to FTS5. If the first results aren't good enough, it iterates: refining terms, trying different queries, narrowing by project. The agent compensates for the simplicity of the search engine. Conversation content helps too. People say the same thing multiple ways across a conversation (\"the migration,\" \"the schema change,\" \"the ALTER TABLE\"), giving keyword search plenty of entry points.\n\n### Background session sync\n\nOn session stop, a sync hook fires asynchronously. It reads the session's JSONL file (where Claude Code stores raw conversation data), parses it into structured messages, detects conversation branches from rewinds using UUID parent chain analysis, and writes everything to the database. This never blocks Claude Code's shutdown.\n\n### A route from recall to archival memory\n\nThe extract-learnings skill reads past conversations and identifies non-obvious insights worth preserving: debugging gotchas, architectural decisions, workflow patterns, behavioral corrections. It proposes placing each learning at the correct layer in the memory hierarchy (global CLAUDE.md, repo CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, or topic files) with diffs and rationale, then writes only after explicit approval.\n\nThis is the route from recall memory (raw conversations) into archival memory (curated, persistent knowledge). Learnings that would otherwise evaporate when context resets get distilled and placed where the agent will see them in future sessions.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Storage\n\nSQLite at `~/.claude-memory/conversations.db` with WAL mode and 5-second busy_timeout for concurrent access. The key design: messages are stored once per session (deduped by UUID), and conversation branches from rewinds are tracked via a many-to-many `branch_messages` table. Each branch's messages are concatenated into a single document and indexed for full-text search. This branch-level aggregation is what makes multi-word search reliable: instead of matching against individual message fragments, FTS5 matches against entire conversation threads.\n\n### FTS cascade\n\nFull-text search uses a platform-adaptive cascade: FTS5 with BM25 ranking on systems that support it, FTS4 with MATCH and snippet on older builds, LIKE fallback on systems without any FTS support. The cascade is detected at startup via `PRAGMA compile_options`.\n\n### Schema (v3)\n\n| Table | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| projects | Project metadata derived from directory structure |\n| sessions | One row per conversation (UUID, timestamps, git branch) |\n| branches | Conversation branches from rewinds, with aggregated content for FTS |\n| messages | User/assistant messages, deduped by UUID |\n| branch_messages | Many-to-many mapping between branches and messages |\n| messages_fts / branches_fts | Full-text search indexes (FTS5, FTS4, or absent) |\n| import_log | Tracks which JSONL files have been imported |\n\n### Hooks\n\n| Event | Hook | Action |\n|-------|------|--------|\n| SessionStart | memory-setup.py | Creates `~/.claude-memory/` directory, triggers initial import if DB missing |\n| SessionStart | memory-context.py | Injects previous session context (on startup and clear events) |\n| Stop | memory-sync.py | Background syncs current session to database |\n\nAll hooks are Python for cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows).\n\n## Manual Usage\n\n```bash\n# Import all conversations into the DB\npython3 plugins/claude-memory/hooks/import_conversations.py\n\n# Import with stats output\npython3 plugins/claude-memory/hooks/import_conversations.py --stats\n\n# Search conversations by keyword\npython3 plugins/claude-memory/skills/past-conversations/scripts/search_conversations.py --query \"authentication OAuth\"\n\n# Browse recent sessions\npython3 plugins/claude-memory/skills/past-conversations/scripts/recent_chats.py --n 5\n```\n\nNo `--force` flag for import. Delete `~/.claude-memory/conversations.db` and re-run to reimport from scratch.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
