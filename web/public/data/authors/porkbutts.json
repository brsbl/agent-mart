Guides you through interviewing to extract implementation-ready requirements, then produces a PRD.\n\n- Triggers when you want to define, scope, or document an application idea\n- Interview phases: Core Concept, User Scenarios, Technical Context, Scope Boundaries\n- Output: Structured PRD with roles, scenarios, acceptance criteria, and technical context\n\n**architecture** - Design technical architecture from a PRD. Transform product requirements into implementation-ready technical specs.\n\n- Use when you want to create an architecture document, define system design, or plan technical implementation\n- Reads from `docs/PRD.md` and outputs `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`\n- Includes: tech stack decisions with rationale, directory structure, key abstractions, data flow, and anti-patterns to avoid\n\n**functional-prototype** - Build working prototypes from PRDs with mock data and stubbed integrations to validate flows before full implementation.\n\n- Triggers: \"build a prototype\", \"functional prototype\", \"make a demo\", \"implement this PRD\", \"prototype this spec\"\n- Output: Working clickable prototype; optionally generates `docs/integration-guide.md` (asks first) documenting how to replace stubs with real integrations\n\n**task-decomposition** - Break down PRD and Architecture into implementable engineering tasks.\n\n- Use when you want to create a task list, plan implementation work, or decompose features into stories and tasks\n- Reads from `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, outputs `docs/TASKS.md`\n- Structure: Epics → User Stories → Atomic Tasks with acceptance criteria and test approaches\n\n**bootstrap-project** - Bootstrap a project with CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, CLAUDE.md, and framework best practices.\n\n- Triggers: \"bootstrap project\", \"setup CI\", \"add pre-commit hooks\", \"add husky\", \"project setup\", \"init CLAUDE.md\"\n- Ensures GitHub CI workflow exists for lint, typecheck, test with coverage, and build\n- Posts coverage summary comments on PRs via `vitest-coverage-report-action` or `jest-coverage-comment`\n- Sets up husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks for lint, format, and typecheck\n- Adds Claude Code hook guard to block `--no-verify` and prevent agents from bypassing pre-commit hooks\n- Generates a `CLAUDE.md` with project overview, architecture summary, key commands, code conventions, and rules — derived from app description, docs, and file structure\n- Installs Vercel best practices via `npx add-skill vercel-labs/agent-skills`\n- Enforces high code coverage thresholds (80%) appropriate for LLM coding agents\n- Detects existing config and only adds what's missing\n\n**task-implementation** - Implement a task end-to-end: read task spec, create git worktree, write tests (TDD), implement feature, verify coverage thresholds, update docs, push branch, and create PR.\n\n- Triggers: \"implement task 1.2.3\", \"work on the auth task\", \"build task 3.1.1\"\n- Reads task specs from `docs/tasks/task-<id>.md` (falls back to `docs/TASKS.md`)\n- Reads `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for context; `docs/BRAND-GUIDELINES.md` for UI work\n- Strict TDD: writes failing tests first, then implements minimum code to pass\n- Enforces 80% coverage thresholds (statements, branches, functions, lines)\n- Handles review feedback loops (reads `## Review Feedback` section from task spec)\n- Ships: commits, pushes feature branch, creates PR with `gh`\n\n**review-pr** - Review pull requests against task specifications.\n\n- Triggers: \"review PR\", \"code review\", \"is this ready to merge\", \"check my PR\"\n- Reads task spec and branch diff, verifies acceptance criteria, audits test coverage\n- Checks for correctness, security (OWASP top 10), architectural adherence, and scope creep\n- Output: Structured verdict (APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES) with evidence per criterion and a Manual QA Checklist\n- Posts review findings as a comment on the PR via `gh pr comment`\n\n**agent-orchestration** - End-to-end project orchestration from idea to implementation.\n\n- Triggers: \"build this app\", \"implement an MVP\", or when you want full project automation\n- Coordinates: product-design → architecture → task-decomposition skills\n- Delegates to: task-spec-generator, task-implementer, code-reviewer, and qa-tester agents\n- Per-task loop: implement → code review → fix feedback → wait for CI checks → merge\n- Per-story QA: after all tasks in a story are merged, QA tests the complete user flow end-to-end\n- Resumable: introspects filesystem and git state to pick up where it left off if interrupted\n\n#### Agents\n\n**task-implementer** - Wraps the task-implementation skill. TDD workflow in isolated git worktrees.\n\n**code-reviewer** - Wraps the review-pr skill. Produces APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES verdicts and writes feedback to task specs.\n\n**qa-tester** - Wraps the qa-verification skill. Visual QA via Playwright against Vercel preview URLs. Commits screenshots to the PR branch and posts a QA report with inline images as a PR comment.\n\n**task-spec-generator** - Generate detailed task specifications from TASKS.md, cross-referenced with PRD and Architecture docs. Creates `docs/tasks/task-<id>.md` for each task with concrete test plans (unit, integration, edge cases) and expanded acceptance criteria.\n"
