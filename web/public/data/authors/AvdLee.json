Add the marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add AvdLee/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill\n   ```\n\n2. Install the Skill:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin install swift-concurrency@swift-concurrency-agent-skill\n   ```\n\n#### Project Configuration\n\nTo automatically provide this Skill to everyone working in a repository, configure the repository's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"swift-concurrency@swift-concurrency-agent-skill\": true\n  },\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": {\n    \"swift-concurrency-agent-skill\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"source\": \"github\",\n        \"repo\": \"AvdLee/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen team members open the project, Claude Code will prompt them to install the Skill.\n\n### Option C: Manual install\n1) **Clone** this repository.  \n2) **Install or symlink** the `swift-concurrency/` folder following your tool’s official skills installation docs (see links below).  \n3) **Use your AI tool** as usual and ask it to use the “swift-concurrency” skill for Swift Concurrency tasks.\n\n#### Where to Save Skills\n\nFollow your tool’s official documentation, here are a few popular ones:\n- **Codex:** [Where to save skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/#where-to-save-skills)\n- **Claude:** [Using Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#using-skills)\n- **Cursor:** [Enabling Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#enabling-skills)\n\n**How to verify**: \n\nYour agent should reference the triage/playbook in `swift-concurrency/SKILL.md` and jump into the relevant reference file for your error or task.\n\n## What This Skill Offers\n\nThis skill gives your AI coding tool comprehensive Swift Concurrency guidance. It can:\n\n### Guide Your Concurrency Decisions\n- Choose the right tool for the job (async/await, actors, tasks, task groups)\n- Understand when to use `@MainActor`, custom actors, or `nonisolated`\n- Navigate isolation domains and prevent data races at compile time\n- Apply `Sendable` conformance correctly for value and reference types\n\n### Write Safe Concurrent Code\n- Avoid common pitfalls like actor reentrancy and retain cycles\n- Prevent data races with proper isolation\n- Handle task cancellation and error propagation correctly\n- Manage memory safely in concurrent contexts\n\n### Optimize Performance\n- Choose between serialized, asynchronous, and parallel execution\n- Reduce actor contention and unnecessary suspension points\n- Understand the tradeoffs of parallelism\n\n### Migrate to Swift 6\n- Step-by-step migration strategies for existing codebases\n- Enable strict concurrency checking incrementally\n- Rewrite closure-based code to async/await\n- Migrate from Combine/RxSwift to Swift Concurrency\n- Use migration tooling for upcoming Swift features\n\n### Test Concurrent Code\n- Write reliable tests using Swift Testing (recommended) or XCTest\n- Handle `@MainActor` isolation in tests\n- Use `withMainSerialExecutor` for deterministic testing\n- Avoid flaky tests with proper async handling\n\n### Integrate with Core Data\n- Safely pass data between isolation domains using `NSManagedObjectID`\n- Implement the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern\n- Use custom actor executors when needed\n- Avoid common Core Data concurrency pitfalls\n\n## What Makes This Skill Different\n\n**Expert Knowledge**: Based on real-world experience migrating large production codebases to Swift 6, distilled from the comprehensive [Swift Concurrency Course](https://www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=agent-skill&utm_campaign=swift-concurrency-skill).\n\n**Non-Opinionated**: Focuses on industry-standard best practices and compile-time safety, not architectural preferences. Works with any Swift project, coding style, or architecture.\n\n**Swift 6.2 Ready**: Covers the latest Swift Concurrency features including:\n- Default Actor Isolation\n- `isolated deinit`\n- Global Actor Conformance for protocols\n- `nonisolated(nonsending)` and `@concurrent`\n- Approachable Concurrency build settings\n- Concurrency-safe notifications (iOS 26+)\n\n**Practical & Concise**: Assumes your AI agent is already smart. Focuses on what developers need to know, not what they already understand. Includes code examples for every pattern.\n\n## See it in action\n[![Youtube Video](assets/agent_skills_watch_on_youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khekVi1PK3o)\n\n\n## Skill Structure\n\n```\nswift-concurrency/\n├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill file with decision trees\n└── references/\n    ├── async-await-basics.md   # Fundamentals of async/await syntax\n    ├── tasks.md                # Task lifecycle, cancellation, priorities\n    ├── sendable.md             # Isolation domains and Sendable conformance\n    ├── actors.md               # Actor isolation, global actors, reentrancy\n    ├── async-sequences.md      # AsyncSequence and AsyncStream patterns\n    ├── threading.md            # Threads vs tasks, suspension points\n    ├── memory-management.md    # Retain cycles, weak self, isolated deinit\n    ├── core-data.md            # Core Data integration patterns\n    ├── performance.md          # Optimization with Xcode Instruments\n    ├── testing.md              # Testing concurrent code\n    ├── migration.md            # Step-by-step Swift 6 migration guide\n    ├── glossary.md             # Terms & concepts for Swift Concurrency\n    └── linting.md              # Linting rules for strict concurrency\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
