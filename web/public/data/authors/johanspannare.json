Each skill is thoroughly documented with philosophy, principles, code examples, and real-world usage patterns.\n\n**What makes this different from other collections?**\n- ✅ **Methodology-driven**: Skills teach approaches, not just execute tasks\n- ✅ **Production-tested**: All skills are validated in real projects\n- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**: Philosophy, principles, examples, and anti-patterns\n- ✅ **Language-agnostic**: Principles apply across technology stacks\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Add this repository to your plugin marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add JohanSpannare/awesome-claude-extensions\n\n# Install available plugins\nclaude plugin install pragmatic-tdd\nclaude plugin install prd-interview\n\n# List installed plugins\nclaude plugin list\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThe plugin marketplace provides automatic updates and easy management:\n\n```bash\n# Add this repository to your marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace add JohanSpannare/awesome-claude-extensions\n\n# View available plugins from this marketplace\nclaude plugin marketplace list\n\n# Install specific plugins\nclaude plugin install pragmatic-tdd\nclaude plugin install prd-interview\n\n# List installed plugins\nclaude plugin list\n```\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### Development Methodology\n\n#### Pragmatic TDD\n**Category:** Testing & Quality\n**Description:** A comprehensive Test-Driven Development approach grounded in Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles. This skill guides you through writing tests that verify business behavior rather than implementation details.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- Test via primary ports, not internal details\n- Mock only at adapter boundaries (external dependencies)\n- Verify complete business flows, not isolated units\n- Tests survive refactoring\n\n**Best For:**\n- Domain-rich business logic\n- DDD/Hexagonal Architecture projects\n- Teams prioritizing test maintainability\n- Systems requiring high confidence in business rules\n\n**[📖 Read full documentation →](./plugins/pragmatic-tdd/README.md)**\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n/pragmatic-tdd\n```\n\nOr mention in conversation:\n```\n\"Use the pragmatic TDD approach to implement user registration\nwith competitor domain detection. Test via the primary port\n(UserRegistrationService) and mock only adapters.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Using Skills\n\nSkills are activated by explicitly requesting them in your conversation with Claude:\n\n#### Example 1: Starting a New Feature\n\n```\nYou: \"I need to implement a feature where users from competitor\ndomains are flagged for manual review. Use the pragmatic TDD\napproach.\"\n\nClaude: [Reads pragmatic-tdd skill documentation]\nClaude: \"I'll guide you through this using TDD. Let's start by\nwriting a test for the business requirement via the primary port...\"\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Code Review with Methodology\n\n```\nYou: \"Review this UserService implementation using pragmatic\nTDD principles. Are we testing at the right level?\"\n\nClaude: [Applies pragmatic-tdd principles]\nClaude: \"I notice these tests are mocking internal validators.\nAccording to pragmatic TDD, we should test via the primary port\ninstead...\"\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Refactoring Guidance\n\n```\nYou: \"I want to extract this competitor detection logic into\na separate class. Will it break tests?\"\n\nClaude: [References pragmatic-tdd principles]\nClaude: \"Since your tests are written via the primary port\n(UserRegistrationService), this refactoring won't break them...\"\n```\n\n### Plugin Scope\n\nPlugins can be installed at different scopes:\n\n- **User scope** (default): Available across all your projects\n- **Project scope**: Install with `--scope project` for project-specific configuration\n\nUse project scope when you want to version-control plugin configuration in your repository.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n#### For Individual Developers\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace once\nclaude plugin marketplace add JohanSpannare/awesome-claude-extensions\n\n# Install plugins you need\nclaude plugin install pragmatic-tdd\nclaude plugin install prd-interview\n\n# Update all plugins when new versions are available\nclaude plugin marketplace update\n```\n\n#### For Teams\n\nAdd to your team's `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# CLAUDE.md\n\n## Required Plugins\n\nThis project uses the following Claude Code plugins:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add JohanSpannare/awesome-claude-extensions\nclaude plugin install pragmatic-tdd@awesome-claude-extensions\nclaude plugin install prd-interview@awesome-claude-extensions\n```\n\n## Development Standards\n\nAll new features MUST:\n1. Follow TDD via primary ports (use `/pragmatic-tdd` skill)\n2. Mock only at adapter boundaries\n3. Verify business flows end-to-end\n4. Start with PRD using `/prd-interview` skill\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome high-quality contributions!

RED: Write test for behavior (via primary port)\n   └─> Test fails (function doesn't exist yet)\n\n2. GREEN: Implement minimal domain logic\n   └─> Test passes\n\n3. REFACTOR: Improve internal structure\n   └─> Tests remain green (they test behavior, not structure)\n```\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Test via Primary Ports\nTest the system through its public API, not internal details.\n\n### Mock Only at Adapter Boundaries\nMock external dependencies (database, HTTP, filesystem), never internal domain logic.\n\n### Verify Business Flows\nTests should prove that business rules actually work, not just that code executes.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis skill is part of the awesome-claude-extensions marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add JohanSpannare/awesome-claude-extensions\nclaude plugin install pragmatic-tdd@awesome-claude-extensions\n```\n\nOr use the awesome-ralphy setup script which installs it automatically.\n\n## Related\n\n- [prd-interview](../prd-interview) - PRD creation with TDD considerations\n- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)\n- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
