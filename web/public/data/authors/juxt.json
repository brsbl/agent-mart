Like [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) but uses GitHub Issues as the storage backend.\n\nEach plugin is open source.

        "plugins/chalk/README.md": "# Chalk\n\nGitHub Issue-backed agent session memory.\n\nSimilar to [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) but uses GitHub Issues as the storage backend, for projects that already have their issue tracking in GitHub.\n\nChalk tracks your Claude Code session progress against a GitHub Issue.\nIt creates a single session comment and edits it in-place as work progresses, giving you a live log of decisions, progress, and blockers.\n\n## Conventions\n\n- **Issue description** = current state (mutable). The tl;dr of where things stand — status, open questions, key decisions. Updated in-place as the picture changes.\n- **Comments** = session log (append-only). One comment per session, edited in-place during the session, but never deleted. Each comment captures what was tried, decided, and learned.\n\nThe issue description is what you read to get up to speed quickly.\nThe comments are what you read when you need to understand *how* you got here — essential context for resuming after compaction or picking up someone else's work.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this plugin to your `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"path/to/chalk\"]\n}\n```\n\nRequires the `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).\n\n## Usage\n\n- `chalk #N` — track this session against issue N\n- `chalk new` — create a new issue and track against it\n- `chalk status` — show what you're tracking\n- `chalk off` — stop tracking\n\nChalk also auto-activates when you mention a GitHub issue number (e.g. \"#123\").\n\n## Components\n\n- **Skill** (`chalk`): The main user-facing skill for session tracking commands\n\n## Permissions\n\nChalk needs permission to run `gh issue` commands.\nAdd these permission rules to allow non-interactive use:\n\n```\nBash(gh issue view *)\nBash(gh issue comment *)\nBash(gh issue edit *)\nBash(gh issue create *)\n```\n"
