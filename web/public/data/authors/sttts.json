        "README.md": "# beads-skill\n\n> **Note:** This skill has moved to [github.com/sttts/skills](https://github.com/sttts/skills) and will be maintained there going forward.\n\nClaude Code plugin for [beads](https://github.com/sttts/beads) issue tracking workflow.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add sttts/beads-skill\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install beads\n```\n\n## What it does\n\nThis plugin provides a skill that activates when your project has a `.beads` directory. It guides Claude through:\n\n- Running `bd prime` at session start\n- Checking ready tasks with `bd ready --pretty`\n- Creating tasks and epics with sensible ID conventions\n- Managing task state (in-progress, closed)\n- PR/MR URL labeling on tasks\n- Worktree management for epics\n- Session completion workflow (the \"landing the plane\" checklist)\n\n## Trigger phrases\n\nThe skill activates when you mention:\n- \"bd\", \"beads\"\n- \"what's next\"\n- \"add task\", \"add epic\"\n- Issue tracking related queries\n\nIt will first check for a `.beads` directory - if not present, the skill does not apply.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [beads](https://github.com/sttts/beads) CLI installed\n- A project with a `.beads` directory\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
