        "README.md": "# Contour (知界)\n\nEnglish | [中文](README.zh.md)\n\nFine-grained cognitive state tracking for Claude Code.\n\nMost AI tools treat you as either an expert or a beginner. Contour tracks exactly what you know, what you partially understand, and what you don't — per knowledge point, per domain — and keeps that state synchronized across sessions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js environment installed\n- Ability to run `npx` commands\n- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add Alexu0317-FATHER/contour\n```\n\n### Register as Plugin Marketplace\n\nRun the following command in Claude Code:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Alexu0317-FATHER/contour\n```\n\n### Install Skills\n\n**Option 1: Via Browse UI**\n1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code\n2. Select `Browse and install plugins`\n3. Select `contour`\n4. Select the plugin(s) you want to install\n5. Select `Install now`\n\n**Option 2: Direct Install**\n```bash\n/plugin install contour@Alexu0317-FATHER/contour\n```\n\n## Update Skills\n\nTo update Contour to the latest version:\n\n1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code\n2. Switch to `Marketplaces` tab (use arrow keys or Tab)\n3. Select `contour`\n4. Choose `Update marketplace`\n\nYou can also Enable auto-update to get the latest versions automatically.\n\n## How it works\n\nContour uses four local files per domain:\n\n- **Core Profile** (`{user}-core.md`) — Your communication profile. Loaded globally, rarely changes.\n- **Domain State** (`{user}-{domain}.md`) — Your cognitive state snapshot for a domain. Updated continuously.\n- **Domain Log** (`{user}-{domain}-log.md`) — Append-only audit log. For your review only.\n- **Extract Buffer** (`extract-buffer.md`) — Cross-session signal buffer.\n\nTwo update mechanisms run in parallel:\n\n1. **Live monitoring** — Instructions injected into `CLAUDE.md` detect cognitive changes during work and update Domain State silently.\n2. **Extract + sync** — `/contour:extract` scans a session for signals; `/contour:sync` distributes them to Domain State and Domain Log.\n\n## Available Commands\n\n| Command | When to run | What it does |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| `/contour:setup` | Once, after install | Initializes your Core Profile, Domain State, Domain Log, and Extract Buffer files and injects monitoring into `CLAUDE.md` |\n| `/contour:extract` | End of a significant session | Scans the session for cognitive signals, writes to buffer |\n| `/contour:sync` | In a new dedicated session | Reads buffer, updates Domain State and Domain Log, clears buffer |\n| `/contour:uninstall` | When you want to remove Contour | Removes monitoring injection from `CLAUDE.md`, optionally deletes data files |\n\n### /contour:setup\n\nInitializes the Contour environment for your workspace.\n\n```bash\n/contour:setup\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n- Creates the necessary data files (`Core Profile`, `Domain State`, etc.) in your local directory.\n- Injects the live monitoring instructions into your workspace's `CLAUDE.md` file.\n- **Note:** Restart Claude Code after setup completes to activate the live monitoring instruction.\n\n### /contour:extract\n\nExtracts cognitive signals from your current session.\n\n```bash\n/contour:extract\n```\n\n**When to use:**\nRun this at the end of a significant working session where you've learned new concepts or demonstrated mastery of existing ones. It scans the conversation history and writes detected signals to the `Extract Buffer`.\n\n### /contour:sync\n\nSynchronizes extracted signals into your permanent cognitive state.\n\n```bash\n/contour:sync\n```\n\n**When to use:**\nRun this in a new, dedicated session (to avoid context pollution). It reads the `Extract Buffer`, updates your `Domain State` and `Domain Log`, and then clears the buffer.\n\n### /contour:uninstall\n\nRemoves Contour from your workspace.\n\n```bash\n/contour:uninstall\n```\n\n**What it does:**\n- Removes the Contour monitoring instructions from your `CLAUDE.md`.\n- Optionally prompts you to delete the local data files.\n\n## Environment Configuration & Data Files\n\nStored at `~/.claude/contour/` by default. \n\nYou can override the default storage location by setting the `$AI_INFRA_DIR` environment variable in your system or `.env` file:\n\n```bash\nexport AI_INFRA_DIR=\"/path/to/your/custom/dir\"\n```\n\nAll files are plain Markdown — readable, editable, and yours.\n\n## Customization\n\nBecause Contour stores your cognitive state in plain Markdown files, you can manually edit them at any time. \n\n- Want to force Claude to treat you as an expert in a specific domain? Open your `{user}-{domain}.md` file and manually update the status of concepts to `mastered`.\n- Want to adjust your communication preferences? Edit your `{user}-core.md` file.\n\nContour will respect your manual edits during the next session.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- **File Modification:** The `/contour:setup` command will modify the `CLAUDE.md` file in your current workspace to inject monitoring instructions.\n- **Data Privacy:** All cognitive state tracking happens locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers by Contour itself (though Claude Code sends prompts to Anthropic's API as usual).\n\n## Version\n\n`v0.2.1` — Pre-release. In active testing.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
