        "README.md": "# Bumper Lanes\n\nBumper lanes gives you two features native to Claude-Code:\n1. A 'Heads Up Display' of the changes Claude makes via unique git-diff visualizations in the status line\n2. A configurable circuit breaker that blocks Claude from continuing until you review and approve the accumulated changes\n\n![Threshold exceeded demo](assets/bumper-demo.gif)\n\n![View modes demo](assets/diff-viz-demo.gif)\n\n## What It Does\n\nBumper-Lanes tracks how much code Claude has written or edited, blocking further edits when a threshold is exceeded. 600 points corresponds roughly to that many lines of code added, depending on the mix of new files vs edits.\n\nWhen the threshold is exceeded:\n\n1. **Fuel gauge warnings** show escalating alerts after each Write/Edit (70% NOTICE → 90% WARNING) to you and to Claude\n2. **Stop hook** blocks Claude from continuing when threshold exceeded\n3. **Reset command** (`/bumper-reset`) restores the budget after you review\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add kylesnowschwartz/claude-bumper-lanes\nclaude plugin install claude-bumper-lanes\n```\n\n**Requirements:** Go 1.21+ (binaries are built automatically on first session start)\n\n## Usage\n\nWork normally with Claude. If the configurable threshold is exceeded:\n\n1. Claude will be blocked from continuing\n2. Review your changes\n3. Optionally commit: `git add -u && git commit -m \"message\"` (resets the baseline automatically)\n4. Or Manually reset the baseline: `/bumper-reset`\n5. Continue working with restored budget\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/bumper-reset` | Reset baseline after reviewing changes |\n| `/bumper-pause` | Pause threshold enforcement (session only) |\n| `/bumper-resume` | Resume threshold enforcement |\n| `/bumper-config` | Show current configuration |\n| `/bumper-config <n>` | Set repo threshold (0=disabled, 50-2000) |\n\n### View Modes\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/bumper-tree` | Indented file tree with +/- stats |\n| `/bumper-smart` | Multi-column table sorted by magnitude |\n| `/bumper-sparkline-tree` | Rainbow sidebar tree with sparkline bars |\n| `/bumper-hotpath` | Hot trail view (follows largest child) |\n| `/bumper-icicle` | Horizontal area chart |\n| `/bumper-brackets` | Nested `[dir file]` single-line |\n| `/bumper-gauge` | Progress gauge showing change magnitude |\n| `/bumper-depth` | Nested gauges by depth level |\n| `/bumper-stat` | Native git diff --stat output |\n\n## Status Line Setup\n\nStatus line is **auto-configured** on first session. No manual setup needed, though you may want to tweak if you use a custom setup.\n\nIf you need to configure manually:\n\nAuto-setup writes this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statusLine\": {\n    \"type\": \"command\",\n    \"command\": \"/path/to/.claude/plugins/cache/.../bumper-lanes status\",\n    \"padding\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe path is versioned and changes on plugin updates—auto-setup handles this automatically.\n\n**Want just the diff visualization?** Install [diff-viz](https://github.com/kylesnowschwartz/diff-viz) globally:\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/kylesnowschwartz/diff-viz/v2/cmd/git-diff-tree@latest\n```\n\nThen use `git-diff-tree` directly in your custom status line scripts. This optionally gives you the tree visualization without the threshold enforcement as well.\n\n### Opting Out of Auto-Setup\n\nTo prevent bumper-lanes from modifying your statusline script, add this comment anywhere in your script:\n\n```bash\n# BUMPER_HANDS_OFF\n```\n\nThis tells bumper-lanes to leave your configuration alone. The plugin will not wrap, update, or regenerate any script containing this marker.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfig files (in precedence order):\n1. `.bumper-lanes.json` at repo root (highest priority)\n2. `~/.config/bumper-lanes/config.json` (global fallback)\n3. Built-in defaults\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threshold\": 400,\n  \"default_view_mode\": \"tree\",\n  \"default_view_opts\": \"--width 80 --depth 3\",\n  \"show_diff_viz\": true\n}\n```\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `threshold` | Points limit. `0` = disabled, `50-2000` = active (default: 600) |\n| `default_view_mode` | Visualization mode (default: tree) |\n| `default_view_opts` | Options passed to diff-viz renderer (e.g., `--width 80 --depth 3`) |\n| `show_diff_viz` | Show diff visualization in status line (default: true) |\n\n**Available view modes:** tree, smart, sparkline-tree, hotpath, icicle, brackets, gauge, depth, stat\n\n### Viz-Only Mode (Global Config)\n\nWant the diff visualization without threshold enforcement? Create a global config:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/bumper-lanes\necho '{\"threshold\": 0}' > ~/.config/bumper-lanes/config.json\n```\n\nThis disables enforcement across all repos while keeping the status line diff visualization. Individual repos can override with their own `.bumper-lanes.json`.\n\nRun `/bumper-config` to see which config files are active.\n\n### Other Options\n\n**Disabling per-repo:** Set `\"threshold\": 0` in `.bumper-lanes.json` to disable for a specific repo.\n\n**Hiding diff visualization:** Set `\"show_diff_viz\": false` to hide the diff tree from the status line. Running any view command (`/bumper-tree`, etc.) restores it for the current session.\n\n### Weighted Scoring\n\n- **New file additions**: 1.0x weight\n- **Edits to existing files**: 1.3x weight (harder to review)\n- **Scatter penalty**: Extra points when touching many files\n- **Deletions**: Not counted (removing code is good)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Go 1.21+ (for automatic binary compilation)\n- Git 2.x+\n- Claude Code with hooks support\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nbumper-lanes-plugin/\n├── bin/                    # Built binaries (auto-generated)\n│   ├── bumper-lanes        # Hook handler\n│   └── git-diff-tree       # Diff visualization (from diff-viz)\n├── scripts/\n│   └── ensure-binaries.sh  # Auto-builds on first run\n├── tools/\n│   └── bumper-lanes/       # Hook handler source (Go)\n├── commands/               # Slash command definitions\n└── hooks/\n    └── hooks.json          # Hook configuration\n```\n\nDiff visualization is provided by [diff-viz](https://github.com/kylesnowschwartz/diff-viz).\n"
