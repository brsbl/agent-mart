Follow this framework exactly:\n\n## Step 1: Clarify the Decision\n\nIf the user provided a decision in the arguments, use it. Otherwise, ask:\n\"What decision are you facing? (e.g., 'Should I take job A or B?', 'Should we launch feature X?')\"\n\n## Step 2: Define KPIs\n\nAsk the user:\n\"What outcomes matter most to you? I'll suggest some, but you should pick 1-3 that you'd actually use to judge success.\"\n\nSuggest relevant KPIs based on the decision domain:\n- Career: income, satisfaction, learning rate, optionality\n- Product: revenue, users, retention, time-to-ship\n- Investment: ROI, risk-adjusted return, liquidity\n- Personal: happiness, regret minimization, relationship impact\n\nGet explicit confirmation on which KPIs to use.\n\n## Step 3: Expand Options\n\nDon't just analyze the stated options. Brainstorm:\n- What other options exist that weren't mentioned?\n- What about hybrid approaches?\n- What about \"do nothing\" or \"wait\"?\n\nPresent 4-6 options total (including originals) and confirm with user.\n\n## Step 4: Decompose and Forecast\n\nFor each Option × KPI combination:\n\n1. **Outside view**: What's the base rate for this class of decision?\n2. **Inside view**: What specific factors apply here?\n3. **Fermi decomposition**: Break into estimable sub-components\n4. **Surface assumptions**: What are you assuming? What would change the estimate?\n5. **Forecast**: Give a point estimate or probability with confidence interval\n\nFormat as a table:\n\n| Option | KPI | Forecast | Key Assumptions | Confidence |\n|--------|-----|----------|-----------------|------------|\n\n## Step 5: Decision Matrix\n\nShow which option wins under different KPI weightings.\nHighlight where forecasts are most uncertain.\nAsk: \"What information would most change these estimates?\"\n\n## Step 6: Log the Decision\n\nAfter completing the analysis, use Python to save the decision using the farness package:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom farness import Decision, KPI, Option, Forecast, DecisionStore\n\n# Create the decision object with all the data from the analysis\ndecision = Decision(\n    question=\"<the decision question>\",\n    context=\"<any relevant context>\",\n    kpis=[\n        KPI(name=\"<kpi1>\", description=\"<desc>\", weight=1.0),\n        # ... more KPIs\n    ],\n    options=[\n        Option(\n            name=\"<option1>\",\n            description=\"<desc>\",\n            forecasts={\n                \"<kpi1>\": Forecast(\n                    point_estimate=<value>,\n                    confidence_interval=(<low>, <high>),\n                    confidence_level=0.8,\n                    reasoning=\"<why>\",\n                    assumptions=[\"<assumption1>\", \"<assumption2>\"],\n                ),\n                # ... more KPI forecasts\n            }\n        ),\n        # ... more options\n    ],\n    review_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=90),\n)\n\n# If user made a choice\ndecision.chosen_option = \"<chosen option name>\"\ndecision.decided_at = datetime.now()\n\n# Save\nstore = DecisionStore()\nstore.save(decision)\nprint(f\"Decision logged: {decision.id[:8]}\")\n```\n\nTell the user: \"Decision logged. Run `farness score` when review date arrives to record outcomes and track calibration.\"\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **Never give direct advice** - only forecasts conditional on actions\n- **Quantify everything** - vague answers defeat the purpose\n- **Surface uncertainty** - confidence intervals matter\n- **Be specific about assumptions** - what would falsify each estimate?\n- **Calibration > accuracy** - being well-calibrated over time matters more than any single prediction\n",

Show unscored decisions (or find by ID if provided)\n2. Display original forecasts for the chosen option\n3. Prompt for actual outcomes per KPI\n4. Calculate errors and CI coverage\n5. Save results and show updated calibration\n\n## Option B: Guided Scoring (if CLI unavailable)\n\n### Step 1: Find the Decision\n\nList unscored decisions:\n\n```bash\nfarness list --unscored\n```\n\nOr show a specific decision:\n\n```bash\nfarness show <id>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Review Original Forecasts\n\nDisplay:\n- The decision question\n- The chosen option\n- Forecasts for each KPI (point estimate, confidence interval)\n- Key assumptions at the time\n\n### Step 3: Gather Outcomes\n\nFor each KPI, ask the user:\n\"What was the actual outcome for [KPI]?\"\n\nGet specific numbers.\n\n### Step 4: Update via Python\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom farness import DecisionStore\n\nstore = DecisionStore()\ndecision = store.get(\"<decision_id>\")\n\ndecision.actual_outcomes = {\n    \"<kpi1>\": <actual_value>,\n    \"<kpi2>\": <actual_value>,\n}\ndecision.scored_at = datetime.now()\ndecision.reflections = \"<user reflections>\"\n\nstore.update(decision)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Show Calibration\n\n```bash\nfarness calibration\n```\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nAfter scoring, ask:\n- \"What did you learn from this decision?\"\n- \"Would you make the same choice with hindsight?\"\n- \"What would you do differently in the analysis?\"\n\nRecord reflections in the decision.\n",

Reframe these as forecasting problems with explicit KPIs.\nversion: 0.1.0\n---\n\n# Farness: Forecasting as a Harness\n\nWhen users ask for advice or opinions, don't give direct answers. Instead, reframe as a forecasting problem.\n\n## Detection Patterns\n\nActivate this skill when you see:\n- \"Should I...\" / \"Should we...\"\n- \"Is X a good idea?\"\n- \"What do you think about...\"\n- \"Do you recommend...\"\n- \"Which is better, A or B?\"\n- \"What would you do?\"\n- Any request for advice, recommendations, or opinions on decisions\n\n## The Reframe\n\nInstead of answering directly, say something like:\n\n\"Rather than give you my opinion, let me help you think through this as a forecasting problem. What outcomes would make this decision successful? Let's define KPIs and forecast how different options perform against them.\"\n\nThen guide toward:\n1. **Explicit KPIs** - What are you optimizing for?\n2. **Multiple options** - Including ones not mentioned\n3. **Quantified forecasts** - P(outcome | action)\n4. **Surfaced assumptions** - What could change these estimates?\n\n## Why This Works\n\n1. **Reduces sycophancy** - Harder to just agree when making numeric predictions\n2. **Forces mechanism thinking** - Must reason about cause and effect\n3. **Creates accountability** - Predictions can be scored later\n4. **Separates values from facts** - User picks KPIs (values), you forecast (facts)\n5. **Builds calibration** - Track predictions over time to improve\n\n## Quick Framework\n\nFor simple questions, use this abbreviated flow:\n\n```\nUser: \"Should I use library X or Y?\"\n\nYou: \"Let me reframe this as forecasts. What matters most - development speed,\nlong-term maintenance, or performance?\n\nIf dev speed: P(ship 2x faster | X) = 60%, P(ship 2x faster | Y) = 40%\nIf maintenance: P(easy maintenance at 2yr | X) = 30%, P(easy maintenance at 2yr | Y) = 70%\n\nKey assumption: You'll need to maintain this for 2+ years. If it's throwaway code,\nthat changes the calculus.\"\n```\n\n## Full Framework\n\nFor important decisions, use `/decide` to run the complete analysis with logging.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **Never say \"I think you should...\"** - Only \"If you value X, then P(Y|A) > P(Y|B)\"\n- **Always surface the KPI** - Make implicit values explicit\n- **Quantify or refuse** - Vague forecasts are useless\n- **Track everything** - Calibration requires data\n- **Confidence intervals matter** - \"70% ± 20%\" is more useful than \"probably\"\n"

When you provide a company description, the AI identifies 5 relevant personas who would interact with your brand:\n\n- **Primary customers/users** - Who will use the product?\n- **Decision makers** - Who approves purchases?\n- **Investors** - Who might fund the company?\n- **Industry experts** - Who analyzes this space?\n- **End consumers** - Who benefits ultimately?\n\nFor example, a B2B SaaS might get personas like:\n- CFO (50s, enterprise, values ROI)\n- Startup founder (30s, fast-mover, values innovation)\n- Developer (25, technical, values ease of use)\n- VC partner (40s, evaluates hundreds of startups)\n- Industry analyst (45, writes about the space)\n\nWhile a consumer app might get:\n- College student (20, social media native)\n- Working parent (35, values convenience)\n- Small business owner (40, budget-conscious)\n\nEach persona then evaluates your name on:\n- **Memorability** (1-10): Will they remember it?\n- **Professionalism** (1-10): Does it seem credible?\n- **Trust**: Would they use a company with this name?\n- **Industry guess**: What sector do they assume?\n- **Gut reaction**: One-sentence impression\n\n### Domain Checking\n\nChecks WHOIS data for:\n- `.com` (weighted highest)\n- `.io` (popular for tech)\n- `.co`\n- `.ai`\n- `.app`\n\nNames where both .com and .io are taken are filtered out in the `find` workflow.\n\n### Social Handle Verification\n\nChecks availability on:\n- Twitter/X\n- GitHub\n\n### Similar Company Analysis\n\nWeb searches for:\n- Exact name matches\n- Companies in similar industries\n- Potential trademark conflicts\n\n**Note:** This is informational only.

For Each Name, Check:\n\n**Domain Availability** (use Bash with whois):\n- .com, .io, .co, .ai\n\n**Social Handles** (use WebFetch):\n- Twitter/X: check if `https://twitter.com/{name}` exists\n- GitHub: check if `https://github.com/{name}` exists\n\n### 3. Quick Perception Check\nFor each name, roleplay as each persona and rate:\n- Memorability (1-10)\n- Professionalism (1-10)\n\n### 4. Brand Scope Analysis (CRITICAL)\nFor each name, assess:\n- **Narrowness**: Does name imply only ONE product/feature? (1-10, higher = more expansive)\n- **Mission fit**: Does name capture the FULL vision, not just current features?\n\nExamples:\n- \"TaxGraph\" for an economy simulation company = 3/10 (too narrow, boxes into tax only)\n- \"Cosilico\" for economy simulation = 9/10 (abstract, allows growth)\n- \"Amazon\" = 10/10 (completely abstract)\n\n### 5. Pronunciation Analysis (Optional)\n\n**Check if phonetic analysis is available and run for each name:**\n```bash\npython -c \"from big_phoney import BigPhoney\" 2>/dev/null && python -m namecast.phonetic \"{name}\" || echo \"SKIP_PHONETIC\"\n```\n\nIf big-phoney is installed, this returns JSON with syllables, phonetic representation (ARPAbet), sounds_like (confusion risk), and difficulty rating.\n\nIf output is \"SKIP_PHONETIC\", skip pronunciation analysis (user hasn't installed `pip install big-phoney`).\n\n### 6.

Does that comport?\"\n\nThe delta between expectation and reality is the key signal.\n\n## Your Task\n\nRun the two-pass evaluation using 5 diverse personas (Opus 4.5 is critical for detecting wordplay):\n\n### 1. Define Personas\nUse these default personas (or generate dynamic ones based on the product):\n- Sarah, 28, Software Engineer - Tech-savvy millennial, values innovation\n- Robert, 55, Small Business Owner - Conservative, values trust and reliability\n- Maya, 34, Marketing Director - Branding expert, very critical of names\n- James, 42, Investor - VC who evaluates hundreds of startups\n- Lisa, 22, College Student - Gen Z, cares about authenticity\n\n### 2. For Each Persona, Run Both Passes\n\n**Pass 1 (Name Only):**\nRoleplay as the persona seeing ONLY the name \"{NAME}\":\n- What industry would you guess they're in?\n- What product/service would you expect?\n- Would you trust this company? (yes/no)\n- Memorability (1-10)\n- Professionalism (1-10)\n\n**Pass 2 (Reality Check):**\nNow reveal: \"{NAME} {PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}\"\n- Does this match your expectations? (yes/partially/no)\n- Comport score (1-10): How well does the product fit the name?\n- Reaction:\n  - \"positive_surprise\" - better/more sophisticated than expected\n  - \"matches\" - exactly what I expected\n  - \"neutral\" - no strong feeling\n  - \"jarring_mismatch\" - confusing, doesn't fit\n- Would you trust them NOW? (yes/no)\n- If there's a mismatch, does it work intentionally? (yes/no)\n\n### 3. Aggregate Results\n\nCalculate:\n- **Avg Comport Score**: Mean of all comport scores (1-10)\n- **Comport Rate**: % who said \"yes\" it comports\n- **Positive Surprise Rate**: % who were pleasantly surprised\n- **Contrast Works Rate**: Of those who saw a mismatch, % who say it works intentionally\n- **Trust Delta**: Change in trust from Pass 1 to Pass 2\n\n### 4. Determine Verdict\n\n- **STRONG FIT**: Avg comport >= 7 AND comport rate >= 60%\n- **POSITIVE CONTRAST**: Positive surprise rate >= 40% AND contrast works rate >= 50%\n- **JARRING MISMATCH**: Jarring rate >= 40% OR (avg comport < 5 AND contrast works rate < 50%)\n- **NEUTRAL**: Everything else\n\n### 5.

Did the contrast work or jar?]\n\n**Recommendation:** [Should they keep the name? What would help - tagline, explanation, different name?]\n\n---\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use Opus 4.5 for this evaluation.

Identify Target Audience Personas\nBased on the mission/description (or infer from the name if not provided), identify 5 relevant personas:\n- Consider: customers, users, investors, partners, employees\n- Make them specific: age, role, industry, values, tech-savviness\n- These should be realistic people who would actually encounter this brand\n\n### 2. Domain Availability (Two-Step Check)\n\n**Step 1: Check registration status via WHOIS**\nUse direct whois servers for accurate results:\n- `.ai`: `whois -h whois.nic.ai {name}.ai` → \"Domain not found.\" = available\n- `.io`: `whois -h whois.nic.io {name}.io` → \"NOT FOUND\" = available\n- `.com`: `whois {name}.com` → \"No match\" = available\n- `.co`: `whois {name}.co` → \"Not found\" = available\n\n**Step 2: For registered domains, check if site is LIVE**\nUse Bash with `curl -sI --connect-timeout 5 https://{name}.{tld}`:\n- HTTP headers returned → active site (brand conflict risk)\n- No response/error → parked (potentially acquirable)\n\n**Classify each domain as:**\n- ✓ Available (not registered)\n- ⚠️ Parked (registered but no active site - acquirable)\n- ✗ Active (registered with live website - brand conflict risk)\n\n**Priority for AI products:** Check .ai first - it's the ideal TLD.\n\n### 3. Social Handle Check\nUse WebFetch to check availability on major platforms:\n- Twitter/X: `https://twitter.com/{name}` - 404 = available\n- GitHub: `https://github.com/{name}` - 404 = available\n\n### 4. Similar Companies Research (Verify Active Status)\n\n**Step 1: Search for similar names**\nUse WebSearch: `\"{name}\" company OR startup OR brand`\n\n**Step 2: Verify each result is ACTIVE**\nFor each company found, use Bash `curl -sI --connect-timeout 5 {their_website}` to check:\n- Is their website live?\n- Are they in the same industry/market?\n- When were they last active? (check for recent news, social posts)\n\n**Classify each competitor as:**\n- 🔴 Active competitor (live site, same market) - high brand conflict risk\n- 🟡 Tangential (live site, different market/geography) - low risk\n- ⚪ Defunct/inactive (no live site, old listings) - no risk\n\nOnly count active, same-market competitors as brand risks.\n\n### 5. Pronunciation Analysis (Optional)\n\n**Check if phonetic analysis is available:**\n```bash\npython -c \"from big_phoney import BigPhoney\" 2>/dev/null && python -m namecast.phonetic \"{name}\" || echo \"SKIP_PHONETIC\"\n```\n\nIf big-phoney is installed, this uses a neural network to predict pronunciation for any word (including made-up brand names) and returns JSON with:\n- `syllables`: syllable count\n- `phonetic`: ARPAbet phonetic representation (e.g., \"M AA1 D IH0 L S AH0 K\" for \"modelsoc\" = \"model sock\")\n- `sounds_like`: similar-sounding words (confusion risk)\n- `difficulty`: easy/medium/hard\n\nIf output is \"SKIP_PHONETIC\", skip this section (user hasn't installed `pip install big-phoney`).\n\nUse these results to assess:\n- Syllable count (1-2 ideal, 3 okay, 4+ harder)\n- Phonetic clarity (check sounds_like for confusion risks like \"model sock\")\n- Ambiguity (spelling patterns that confuse readers)\n\n### 6. International Check\nConsider if the name has problematic meanings in:\n- Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic\n\n### 7. Dynamic Persona Perception Analysis\nFor each persona you identified, roleplay as them and provide:\n- Memorability rating (1-10)\n- Professionalism/credibility rating (1-10)\n- Mission alignment (1-10, if mission provided)\n- One-sentence gut reaction\n- Would they trust/use a company with this name? (yes/maybe/no)\n\n### 8. Brand Scope Analysis (CRITICAL)\nEvaluate whether the name boxes in the company or allows for growth:\n- **Narrowness penalty**: Does the name imply only ONE product/feature? (e.g., \"TaxGraph\" = only tax, \"InvoiceBot\" = only invoices)\n- **Expansion potential**: Could the company expand into adjacent areas without the name feeling wrong?\n- **Vision alignment**: Does the name capture the FULL mission, not just current features?\n\nScore 1-10:\n- 10: Name is abstract/expansive, allows unlimited growth (e.g., \"Amazon\", \"Apple\")\n- 7-9: Name hints at domain but doesn't constrain (e.g., \"Stripe\" for payments)\n- 4-6: Name somewhat limits scope but has flexibility\n- 1-3: Name boxes company into narrow niche (e.g., \"TaxGraph\" for an economy simulation company)\n\n### 9. Tagline Pairing (if mission provided)\nGenerate 3 potential taglines that:\n- Explain/complement the name\n- Capture the full mission\n- Are memorable and quotable\n\nRate the name-tagline pairing potential (1-10): How well can a tagline \"rescue\" a confusing name?\n\n### 10. Calculate Overall Score (0-100)\n\n**Domain scoring (15 pts):**\n- For each of .com, .ai, .io: ✓ available = 5pts, ⚠️ parked = 3pts, ✗ active = 0pts\n- Weight .ai highest for AI/tech products, .com for general business\n\n**Other scoring:**\n- Social handles: 5 pts\n- Similar companies: 15 pts (only deduct for 🔴 active same-market competitors)\n- Pronunciation: 10 pts (skip if big-phoney not installed, redistribute to other categories)\n- International: 10 pts\n- Persona perception: 20 pts\n- **Brand scope: 15 pts** (penalize narrow names)\n- **Tagline potential: 10 pts** (can a tagline make the name click?)\n\n### 11.

Similar Companies (WebSearch)\nSearch: `\"{name}\" company OR startup OR brand`\n\nClassify each result:\n- 🔴 **Active competitor** (same market, live site) → eliminate\n- 🟡 **Tangential** (different market/geography) → flag only\n- ⚪ **Defunct** (no live site, old mentions) → ignore\n\n### 4b. International Meanings\nCheck major languages for problematic meanings:\n- Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic\n\n**Elimination criteria:**\n- Active same-market competitor with similar name\n- Offensive/negative meaning in major language\n\n---\n\n## Stage 5: Deep Evaluation\n\nFor finalists (target 4-6 names):\n\n### 5a.

Checks domain availability, social handles, trademarks, pronunciation, international meanings, similar companies, and AI perception prophecy.\nversion: 0.1.0\n---\n\n# Brand Name Oracle Skill\n\nForecast brand name success comprehensively across multiple dimensions. This skill provides a structured approach to brand name prophecy.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- User asks to forecast a potential brand/company/product name's success\n- User wants to check if a name is \"good\" or \"available\"\n- User is deciding between name options\n- User wants oracle insight on a name they're considering\n\n## Forecasting Framework\n\nFor each brand name, forecast across these dimensions:\n\n### 1. Domain Availability (Check these TLDs)\n- .com (most important)\n- .io (tech startups)\n- .co (alternative)\n- .ai (AI companies)\n- .app (applications)\n\n**How to check:** Run `whois {name}.com` etc. via Bash tool to check actual availability.\n\n### 2. Social Handle Availability\n- Twitter/X (@name)\n- Instagram (@name)\n- LinkedIn (company/name)\n- TikTok (@name)\n- GitHub (if tech company)\n\n**How to check:** Use WebFetch to check if handles exist or are available.\n\n### 3. Trademark Risk Assessment\n- Search USPTO TESS database via WebSearch\n- Check for similar marks in the same class\n- Assess likelihood of confusion\n\n**Risk levels:**\n- **Low:** No similar marks found\n- **Medium:** Similar marks exist but different industry\n- **High:** Similar marks in same industry\n\n### 4. Pronunciation Analysis\n\nScore 1-10 based on:\n- Number of syllables (fewer = better, 1-2 is ideal)\n- Phonetic clarity (no ambiguous sounds)\n- Spelling predictability (can people spell it from hearing it?)\n- International pronounceability\n\n### 5. International Check\n\nCheck for problematic meanings in:\n- Spanish\n- French\n- German\n- Mandarin\n- Japanese\n- Portuguese\n- Arabic\n\n**Red flags:** Profanity, negative connotations, embarrassing meanings\n\n### 6. Similar Companies Check\n\nSearch for existing companies with similar names to identify confusion risk:\n\n**Check for:**\n- Phonetically similar names (sound alike when spoken)\n- Visually similar names (look alike when written)\n- Names with similar prefixes/suffixes\n- Names in the same or adjacent industries\n\n**How to check:** Use WebSearch to find companies with similar names. Consider:\n- Direct competitors with similar names\n- Well-known brands that could cause confusion\n- Companies that might have trademark claims\n\n**Risk levels:**\n- **Low:** No similar companies found, or only in unrelated industries\n- **Medium:** Similar names exist in adjacent industries\n- **High:** Very similar names in same industry, or conflicts with well-known brands\n\n### 7.
