Since it\n> uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) it is safe to use, but expect\n> big changes between major version updates.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe complete SDK documentation is available via standard Go documentation tools. Use `go doc` or visit the [GoDoc site](https://godoc.org/github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk) to browse the documentation.\n\n### Major topics:\n\n- Application Layout - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk`\n- Command Structure with cmdutil - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/pkg/cmdutil`\n- Runner Pattern - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/pkg/cmdutil`\n- HTTP Handlers with webutil - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/pkg/webutil`\n- Worker Management with runutil - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/pkg/runutil`\n- Dependency Injection with digutil - see `go doc github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/pkg/digutil`\n\n### Claude Code\n\nThis repository implements a Claude marketplace which add some assisting functionality to Claude. The most important one\nis a \"Skill\" that contains documentation tailored for Claude Code.\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nFor practical examples of using the SDK, check the `examples/` directory, which contains:\n\n- `examples/minimal/` - A minimal application using the SDK\n- `examples/full/` - A complete application with HTTP handlers, workers, and more\n\n## Major Release Notes\n\nNote: `vN` is the new release (eg `v3`) and `vP` is the previous one (eg `v2`).\n\n1. Create a new branch `release-vN` to avoid breaking changes getting into the previous release.\n2. Do your breaking changes in the branch.\n3. Update the imports everywhere:\n   * `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's#github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/vO#github.com/rebuy-de/rebuy-go-sdk/vP#g' {} +`\n4. Merge your branch.\n5. Add Release on GitHub.\n"
