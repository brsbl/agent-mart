FastAPI endpoint following the layered architecture pattern.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAPI Endpoint: $ARGUMENTS\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. **Project Structure**\nFollow the standard FastAPI layered architecture:\n- `app/controllers/` - API routers with FastAPI endpoints\n- `app/services/` - Business logic layer\n- `app/repositories/` - Database access layer (if needed)\n- `app/models/entities.py` - SQLAlchemy ORM models\n- `app/models/request_dtos.py` - Pydantic request DTOs\n- `app/models/response_dtos.py` - Pydantic response DTOs\n\n### 2. **Controller Pattern**\nUse FastAPI APIRouter with dependency injection:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, Depends\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\nfrom app.config.database import get_db\nfrom app.models.request_dtos import ItemRequestDTO, QueryParams\nfrom app.models.response_dtos import ItemResponseDTO, PaginatedResponseDTO\nfrom app.services.item_service import ItemService\nfrom app.utils.security_utils import is_user_or_up, is_admin_or_up\nfrom app.models.entities import User\n\nrouter = APIRouter(tags=[\"Items\"])\n\ndb_dep = Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]\nuser_dep = Annotated[User, Depends(is_user_or_up)]\nadmin_dep = Annotated[User, Depends(is_admin_or_up)]\n\n\n@router.get(\"/items\", response_model=PaginatedResponseDTO[ItemResponseDTO])\ndef get_items(db: db_dep, current_user: user_dep, query_params: QueryParams = Depends()):\n    service = ItemService(db)\n    result = service.get_items(query_params)\n    return result\n\n\n@router.post(\"/items\", response_model=ItemResponseDTO)\ndef create_item(item_dto: ItemRequestDTO, db: db_dep, current_user: user_dep):\n

service.delete_item(item_id)\n```\n\n### 3. **Request DTOs**\nDefine Pydantic models for incoming data in `request_dtos.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict\n\n\nclass BaseModelIgnore(BaseModel):\n    model_config = ConfigDict(extra='ignore')\n\n\nclass ItemRequestDTO(BaseModelIgnore):\n    name: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=256)\n    description: Optional[str] = None\n    quantity: int = Field(gt=0)\n    is_active: bool = True\n```\n\n### 4. **Response DTOs**\nDefine Pydantic models for outgoing data in `response_dtos.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\n\nclass ItemResponseDTO(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    description: Optional[str] = None\n    quantity: int\n    is_active: bool\n    created_on: Optional[datetime] = None\n    updated_on: Optional[datetime] = None\n```\n\n### 5. **Repository Layer**\nFor complex queries or to separate database access logic, create a repository in `app/repositories/`:\n\n**Simple Repository Pattern:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import delete, func\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\nfrom app.models.entities import Item\n\n\nclass ItemRepository:\n    def __init__(self, db: Session):\n        self.db = db\n\n    def create_item(self, item: Item) -> Item:\n        self.db.add(item)\n        self.db.commit()\n        self.db.refresh(item)\n        return item\n\n    def get_item_by_id(self, item_id: int) -> Item:\n        return self.db.query(Item).filter(Item.id == item_id).first()\n\n    def update_item(self, item: Item) -> Item:\n        self.db.commit()\n        self.db.refresh(item)\n        return item\n\n    def delete_item_by_id(self, item_id: int) -> None:\n        self.db.execute(delete(Item).where(Item.id == item_id))\n        self.db.commit()\n\n    def delete_items_by_ids(self, item_ids: list[int]) -> None:\n        self.db.execute(delete(Item).where(Item.id.in_(item_ids)))\n        self.db.commit()\n\n    def get_items_count(self) -> int:\n        return self.db.query(func.count(Item.id)).scalar()\n```\n\n### 6. **Service Layer**\nImplement business logic in service classes.\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\nfrom app.models.entities import Item\nfrom app.models.request_dtos import ItemRequestDTO, QueryParams\nfrom app.models.response_dtos import ItemResponseDTO, PaginatedResponseDTO\nfrom app.repositories.item_repository import ItemRepository\n\n\nclass ItemService:\n    def __init__(self, db: Session):\n        self.repository = ItemRepository(db)\n\n    def create_item(self, item_dto: ItemRequestDTO) -> ItemResponseDTO:\n        item = Item(**item_dto.dict())\n        created_item = self.repository.create_item(item)\n        return ItemResponseDTO.model_validate(created_item)\n\n    def get_item(self, item_id: int) -> ItemResponseDTO:\n        item = self.repository.get_item_by_id(item_id)\n        if not item:\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n        return ItemResponseDTO.model_validate(item)\n\n    def update_item(self, item_id: int, updates: dict) -> ItemResponseDTO:\n        item = self.repository.get_item_by_id(item_id)\n        if not item:\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n\n        for key, value in updates.items():\n            setattr(item, key, value)\n\n        updated_item = self.repository.update_item(item)\n        return ItemResponseDTO.model_validate(updated_item)\n\n    def delete_item(self, item_id: int) -> None:\n        item = self.repository.get_item_by_id(item_id)\n        if not item:\n            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n        self.repository.delete_item_by_id(item_id)\n```\n\n### 7. **SQLAlchemy Entity**\nDefine database model in `entities.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Sequence, Text, TIMESTAMP, Boolean\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import func\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass Item(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'items'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence(\"items_seq\"), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(Text, nullable=False)\n    description = Column(Text)\n    quantity = Column(Integer, nullable=False)\n    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True)\n    created_on = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=func.now())\n    updated_on = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"<Item(id={self.id}, name={self.name})>\"\n```\n\n### 8. **Register Router in main.py**\nAdd the router to your FastAPI app:\n\n```python\nfrom app.controllers.item_controller import router as item_router\n\ndef add_endpoints(app: FastAPI):\n    # ... existing routers\n    app.include_router(item_router, prefix=\"/api\")\n```\n\n### 9. **Best Practices**\n\n**Dependency Injection:**\n- Use `Annotated` types for cleaner dependency declarations\n- Create reusable dependency aliases (`db_dep`, `user_dep`, `admin_dep`)\n- Inject `Session` for database access and `User` for authentication\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Use `HTTPException` with appropriate status codes\n- Return 404 for not found resources\n- Return 204 for successful deletions\n- Return 400 for validation errors\n\n**Validation:**\n- Use Pydantic Field validators for request DTOs\n- Validate input early in the controller\n- Use `BaseModelIgnore` to ignore extra fields\n\n**Database Operations:**\n- Always commit after modifications\n- Use `refresh()` to get updated data after commit\n- Handle transactions properly in services\n\n**Security:**\n- Use role-based access control (`is_user_or_up`, `is_admin_or_up`)\n- Protect sensitive endpoints with appropriate dependencies\n- Validate user permissions in service layer if needed\n\n**Response Models:**\n- Use `response_model` parameter for automatic validation\n- Use `PaginatedResponseDTO` for list endpoints\n- Include timestamps (`created_on`, `updated_on`)\n\n### 9. **Common Patterns**\n\n**Query Parameters:**\nUse the shared `QueryParams` DTO for pagination and filtering:\n```python\nclass QueryParams(BaseModelIgnore):\n    page: int = 0\n    page_size: int = 10\n    search: Optional[str] = None\n    order_by: str = \"id\"\n    order: str = \"desc\"\n```\n\n**Generic Multi-Request:**\nFor batch operations:\n```python\nclass GenericMultiRequestDTO(BaseModelIgnore):\n    ids: list[int]\n\n@router.delete(\"/items\", status_code=204)\ndef delete_items(request: GenericMultiRequestDTO, db: db_dep, current_user: admin_dep):\n    service = ItemService(db)\n    service.delete_items(request.ids)\n```\n\n**Relationships:**\nWhen entities have relationships, use `relationship()` and nested DTOs:\n```python\n# In entities.py\nclass Item(Base):\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n    user = relationship(\"User\")\n\n# In response_dtos.py\nclass ItemResponseDTO(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    user: UserResponseDTO  # Nested DTO\n```\n\n## Output\n\nGenerate production-ready FastAPI code with:\n1. **Controller** - FastAPI router with CRUD endpoints\n2. **Service** - Business

create new ones for changes\n\n### 8. **Validation Checklist**\n\n-   [ ] Changelog uses plain SQL format with Liquibase headers\n-   [ ] Unique changeset IDs (<author>:<file-nr>-<change-nr>)\n-   [ ] Rollback statements provided for all changes\n-   [ ] Appropriate column types and constraints\n-   [ ] Indexes created for foreign keys and frequently queried columns\n-   [ ] Timestamps use TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for timezone awareness\n-   [ ] IF NOT EXISTS used where appropriate for idempotency\n-   [ ] Optional comments explain the purpose of changes\n\n## Output\n\nGenerate production-ready Liquibase SQL changelog files that:\n\n1.

following Material-UI (MUI) best practices.\n\n## Requirements\n\nComponent Specification: $ARGUMENTS\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. **Component Structure**\nOrganize components in the `src/helper-components/` directory:\n- `form/` - Form-related components (inputs, selectors, steppers)\n- `input/` - Input components (text fields, checkboxes, etc.)\n- `table/` - Table and data grid components\n- `misc/` - Miscellaneous utility components\n- `pages/` - Full page components\n\n### 2. **Component Template**\n\n**Basic Component:**\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Box, Typography } from '@mui/material';\n\nexport default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2, ...props }) {\n    return (\n        <Box sx={{ /* styles */ }}>\n            <Typography variant=\"h6\">\n                Component Content\n            </Typography>\n        </Box>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**Component with State:**\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { Box, Button, TextField } from '@mui/material';\n\nexport default function ComponentName({ initialValue, onSave }) {\n    const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue || '');\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        // Side effects here\n    }, [value]);\n\n    const handleSave = () => {\n        if (onSave) {\n            onSave(value);\n        }\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <Box>\n            <TextField\n                value={value}\n                onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}\n                fullWidth\n            />\n            <Button onClick={handleSave} variant=\"contained\">\n                Save\n            </Button>\n        </Box>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Material-UI Patterns**\n\n**Using sx prop for styling:**\n```jsx\n<Box\n    sx={{\n        display: 'flex',\n        flexDirection: 'column',\n        gap: 2,\n        p: 3,\n        bgcolor: 'background.paper',\n        borderRadius: 1\n    }}\n>\n    {/* content */}\n</Box>\n```\n\n**Responsive Design:**\n```jsx\n<Box\n    sx={{\n        width: { xs: '100%', sm: '80%', md: '60%' },\n        p: { xs: 2, md: 4 }\n    }}\n>\n    {/* content */}\n</Box>\n```\n\n**Theme Integration:**\n```jsx\nimport { useTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';\n\nexport default function ComponentName() {\n    const theme = useTheme();\n\n    return (\n        <Box\n            sx={{\n                color: theme.palette.primary.main,\n                backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default\n            }}\n        >\n            {/* content */}\n        </Box>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Common MUI Components**\n\n**Form Components:**\n```jsx\nimport {\n    TextField,\n    Select,\n    MenuItem,\n    FormControl,\n    InputLabel,\n    Checkbox,\n    FormControlLabel,\n    Button\n} from '@mui/material';\n\n<TextField\n    label=\"Name\"\n    value={value}\n    onChange={handleChange}\n    fullWidth\n    required\n    error={!!error}\n    helperText={error}\n/>\n\n<FormControl fullWidth>\n    <InputLabel>Category</InputLabel>\n    <Select value={category} onChange={handleCategoryChange}>\n        <MenuItem value=\"option1\">Option 1</MenuItem>\n        <MenuItem value=\"option2\">Option 2</MenuItem>\n    </Select>\n</FormControl>\n\n<FormControlLabel\n    control={<Checkbox checked={isChecked} onChange={handleCheck} />}\n    label=\"Accept terms\"\n/>\n```\n\n**Layout Components:**\n```jsx\nimport { Container, Grid, Paper, Card, CardContent } from '@mui/material';\n\n<Container maxWidth=\"lg\">\n    <Grid container spacing={3}>\n        <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>\n            <Paper sx={{ p: 2 }}>\n                <Typography variant=\"h6\">Section</Typography>\n            </Paper>\n        </Grid>\n    </Grid>\n</Container>\n\n<Card>\n    <CardContent>\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"div\">\n            Card Title\n        </Typography>\n        <Typography variant=\"body2\">\n            Card content\n        </Typography>\n    </CardContent>\n</Card>\n```\n\n**Data Display:**\n```jsx\nimport { DataGrid } from '@mui/x-data-grid';\n\nconst columns = [\n    { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 90 },\n    { field: 'name', headerName: 'Name', width: 150 },\n    { field: 'email', headerName: 'Email', width: 200 }\n];\n\n<DataGrid\n    rows={rows}\n    columns={columns}\n    pageSize={10}\n    checkboxSelection\n    disableSelectionOnClick\n/>\n```\n\n**Dialogs and Modals:**\n```jsx\nimport { Dialog, DialogTitle, DialogContent, DialogActions } from '@mui/material';\n\n<Dialog open={open} onClose={handleClose} maxWidth=\"md\" fullWidth>\n    <DialogTitle>Dialog Title</DialogTitle>\n    <DialogContent>\n        {/* Dialog content */}\n    </DialogContent>\n    <DialogActions>\n        <Button onClick={handleClose}>Cancel</Button>\n        <Button onClick={handleSave} variant=\"contained\">Save</Button>\n    </DialogActions>\n</Dialog>\n```\n\n**Notifications:**\n```jsx\nimport { useSnackbar } from 'notistack';\n\nexport default function ComponentName() {\n    const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();\n\n    const handleSuccess = () => {\n        enqueueSnackbar('Operation successful!', { variant: 'success' });\n    };\n\n    const handleError = () => {\n        enqueueSnackbar('Something went wrong', { variant: 'error' });\n    };\n\n    // ... rest of component\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **State Management Patterns**\n\n**Local State:**\n```jsx\nconst [formData, setFormData] = useState({\n    name: '',\n    email: '',\n    age: 0\n});\n\nconst handleInputChange = (field) => (event) => {\n    setFormData(prev => ({\n        ...prev,\n        [field]: event.target.value\n    }));\n};\n```\n\n**Form Validation:**\n```jsx\nconst [errors, setErrors] = useState({});\n\nconst validate = () => {\n    const newErrors = {};\n\n    if (!formData.name) {\n        newErrors.name = 'Name is required';\n    }\n    if (!formData.email.includes('@')) {\n        newErrors.email = 'Invalid email';\n    }\n\n    setErrors(newErrors);\n    return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0;\n};\n\nconst handleSubmit = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (validate()) {\n        // Submit form\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### 6. **API Integration**\n\n**Fetching Data:**\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ComponentName() {\n    const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n    const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        const fetchData = async () => {\n            try {\n                const response = await fetch('/api/items');\n                if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');\n                const result = await response.json();\n                setData(result);\n            } catch (err) {\n                setError(err.message);\n            } finally {\n                setLoading(false);\n            }\n        };\n\n        fetchData();\n    }, []);\n\n    if (loading) return <CircularProgress />;\n    if (error) return <Alert severity=\"error\">{error}</Alert>;\n\n    return (\n        <Box>\n            {/* Render data */}\n        </Box>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**Posting Data:**\n```jsx\nconst handleSubmit = async (formData) => {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch('/api/items', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n                'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify(formData)\n        });\n\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to save');\n\n        const result = await response.json();\n        enqueueSnackbar('Saved successfully!', { variant: 'success' });\n        return result;\n    } catch (err) {\n        enqueueSnackbar(err.message, { variant: 'error' });\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### 7. **Common Patterns**\n\n**Loading States:**\n```jsx\nimport { CircularProgress, Box } from '@mui/material';\n\n{loading ? (\n    <Box display=\"flex\" justifyContent=\"center\" p={3}>\n        <CircularProgress />\n    </Box>\n) : (\n    <DataContent />\n)}\n```\n\n**Conditional Rendering:**\n```jsx\n{items.length > 0 ? (\n    <List>\n        {items.map(item => (\n            <ListItem key={item.id}>{item.name}</ListItem>\n        ))}\n    </List>\n) : (\n    <Typography variant=\"body2\" color=\"text.secondary\">\n        No items found\n    </Typography>\n)}\n```\n\n**Event Handlers:**\n```jsx\n// Inline arrow function (for simple handlers)\n<Button onClick={() => handleClick(id)}>Click</Button>\n\n// Named function (for complex handlers)\nconst handleDelete = (id) => {\n    if (window.confirm('Are you sure?')) {\n        deleteItem(id);\n    }\n};\n<Button onClick={() => handleDelete(item.id)}>Delete</Button>\n```\n\n### 8. **Best Practices**\n\n**Component Organization:**\n- Keep components focused and single-purpose\n- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks\n- Use prop destructuring for cleaner code\n- Provide default props where appropriate\n\n**Performance:**\n- Use React.memo() for expensive components\n- Memoize callbacks with useCallback when passing to children\n- Avoid inline object/array creation in render\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- Use semantic HTML elements\n- Provide aria-labels for interactive elements\n- Ensure keyboard navigation works\n- Test with screen readers\n\n**Styling:**\n- Prefer sx prop over inline styles\n- Use theme values for consistency\n- Keep responsive design in mind\n- Use MUI breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, xl\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Always handle loading and error states\n- Show user-friendly error messages\n- Use notistack for notifications\n- Log errors for debugging\n\n## Output\n\nGenerate production-ready React component code with:\n1. **Component file** - Complete .jsx file with imports\n2. **Props documentation** - Clear prop descriptions and types\n3. **Usage example** - How to use the component\n4. **MUI integration** - Proper use of Material-UI components\n5. **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach\n\nAll code should follow the established patterns from the existing codebase and Material-UI best practices.\n",

                      </Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\">\n                                {new Date(item.created_on).toLocaleString()}\n                            </Typography>\n                        </Grid>\n                    </Grid>\n                </Paper>\n            </Box>\n        </Container>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Routing Setup**\n\n**Add route in App.jsx:**\n```jsx\nimport { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport ItemListPage from './pages/ItemListPage';\nimport ItemDetailPage from './pages/ItemDetailPage';\nimport ItemFormPage from './pages/ItemFormPage';\n\nfunction App() {\n    return (\n        <BrowserRouter>\n            <Routes>\n                <Route path=\"/items\" element={<ItemListPage />} />\n                <Route path=\"/items/new\" element={<ItemFormPage />} />\n                <Route path=\"/items/:id\" element={<ItemDetailPage />} />\n                <Route path=\"/items/:id/edit\" element={<ItemFormPage />} />\n            </Routes>\n        </BrowserRouter>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 6. **Best Practices**\n\n**Page Layout:**\n- Use Container with consistent maxWidth (lg, md, xl)\n- Add vertical padding with `py: 4` for spacing\n- Keep responsive design in mind\n\n**Loading States:**\n- Show CircularProgress centered for full page loads\n- Use skeleton loaders for partial updates\n- Disable buttons during async operations\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Display errors with Alert components\n- Use notistack for notifications\n- Redirect on critical errors (404, 403)\n\n**Navigation:**\n- Use useNavigate hook for programmatic navigation\n- Use Link component for declarative navigation\n- Provide back buttons and breadcrumbs\n\n**Data Fetching:**\n- Fetch data in useEffect\n- Handle loading and error states\n- Clean up subscriptions/aborts on unmount\n\n## Output\n\nGenerate production-ready React page code with:\n1. **Page component** - Complete .jsx file with routing integration\n2. **Data fetching** - API integration with loading/error states\n3. **Form handling** - If applicable, with validation\n4. **Navigation** - Proper routing and navigation patterns\n5. **MUI components** - Consistent Material-UI usage\n\nAll code should follow react-router-dom v6 patterns and Material-UI best practices.\n"
