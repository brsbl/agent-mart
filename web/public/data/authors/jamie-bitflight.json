Instead of generic responses, Claude will:\n\n- Follow modern language conventions (Python 3.11+, Bash 5.1+, Perl 5.30+)\n- Use your preferred tools and libraries consistently\n- Verify work thoroughly before claiming completion\n- Apply systematic problem-solving approaches\n- Produce production-ready code with proper testing and quality checks\n\n## How Plugins Work\n\nPlugins contain:\n\n- **Skills** - Knowledge and workflows that guide Claude's behavior\n- **Commands** - Slash commands you can invoke directly (like `/lint` or `/modernpython`)\n- **Agents** - Specialized sub-agents for complex tasks (like code review or architecture design)\n- **Hooks** - Automation that runs at specific lifecycle events\n\nOnce installed, plugins work automatically - Claude knows when to use them based on your project context.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```text\nplugins/plugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json       # Plugin manifest\n├── skills/               # What Claude learns\n├── commands/             # Slash commands you can use\n├── agents/               # Specialized sub-agents\n└── README.md             # Documentation\n```\n\n## Featured Plugins\n\n### For Python Developers\n\n**[python3-development](./plugins/python3-development)** - The most comprehensive plugin in this collection. Transform Claude into a Python 3.11+ expert with 15+ commands, 17 specialized agents, TDD workflows, modern library selection (Typer, Rich, httpx, pytest), and SAM methodology for complete feature development. Includes extensive reference documentation covering 50+ modern Python libraries.\n\n**[holistic-linting](./plugins/holistic-linting)** - Automatic code quality enforcement with root-cause fixing. Claude discovers your project's linters (ruff, mypy, bandit), runs them before completing tasks, and resolves issues through systematic analysis rather than suppression comments.\n\n**[uv](./plugins/uv)** - Expert guidance for Astral's uv - the extremely fast Python package manager that replaces pip, poetry, pyenv, and virtualenv. Creates modern projects with lockfiles, writes portable scripts with PEP 723 inline dependencies, and configures CI/CD using best practices.\n\n### For Systems Programming\n\n**[bash-development](./plugins/bash-development)** - Write production-ready Bash 5.1+ scripts with modern error handling, POSIX portability checking, integrated logging framework, ShellCheck-aware linting, and test framework guidance. Includes specialized agents for script development and code auditing.\n\n**[perl-development](./plugins/perl-development)** - Build robust Perl 5.30+ applications with strict/warnings/autodie pragmas, CPAN ecosystem management, comprehensive testing with Test2::V0, and Perl::Critic linting. Includes agents for development, auditing, and CLI architecture.\n\n### For Better Claude Behavior\n\n**[agent-orchestration](./plugins/agent-orchestration)** - Scientific delegation framework that makes Claude investigate root causes before implementing fixes, think about full scope instead of single issues, and verify work actually functions before claiming completion.\n\n**[verification-gate](./plugins/verification-gate)** - Pre-action verification checkpoints that prevent Claude from jumping to solutions. Validates hypothesis-action alignment and catches situations where correct diagnosis leads to wrong implementation (like running the wrong package manager).\n\n**[hallucination-detector](./plugins/hallucination-detector)** - Stop-hook that blocks task completion on speculation patterns. Catches ungrounded causality, pseudo-quantification without methodology, and completeness overclaims - forcing evidence-first rewrites.\n\n**[brainstorming-skill](./plugins/brainstorming-skill)** - Improves idea generation with 30+ research-validated prompt patterns (role-based perspectives, constraint exploration, analogical thinking, inversion techniques). Structured techniques generate more ideas with reasoning while working within your actual constraints.\n\n### For Plugin & Tool Developers\n\n**[plugin-creator](./plugins/plugin-creator)** - Complete toolkit with 14 skills and 6 specialized agents for creating, refactoring, and validating Claude Code plugins. Includes systematic refactoring workflows, frontmatter validation, internal link checking, and automated quality enforcement.\n\n**[fastmcp-creator](./plugins/fastmcp-creator)** - Build production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with FastMCP framework specialization, agent-centric design patterns, Pydantic validation, async operations, and deployment guidance. Covers both Python (FastMCP) and TypeScript implementations.\n\n**[clang-format](./plugins/clang-format)** - Configure clang-format to match your existing C/C++ code style instead of forcing a style. Analyzes patterns, tests configuration hypotheses, measures impact (line changes vs whitespace), and shows diffs before applying changes.\n\n## Local Development\n\nFor testing plugins during development:\n\n```bash\n# Option 1: Load specific plugins for this session\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/python3-development --plugin-dir ./plugins/holistic-linting\n\n# Option 2: Add local marketplace for persistent enable/disable\n/plugin marketplace add ./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n\n# Install plugins you need (--scope local keeps it gitignored)\n/plugin install python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills --scope local\n\n# Disable when not needed\n/plugin disable python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills\n\n# Re-enable when needed\n/plugin enable python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on adding, removing, or updating plugins.\n\nQuick overview:\n\n1.

        "plugins/agent-orchestration/README.md": "# Agent Orchestration\n\nMakes Claude more thorough and systematic when handling complex, multi-step tasks.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you ask Claude to do something involving multiple steps or files, Claude sometimes:\n\n- Fixes only the specific instance you pointed out, missing similar issues elsewhere\n- Says \"done\" without actually verifying the solution works\n- Applies quick patches that address symptoms instead of root causes\n- Makes assumptions without checking them against the actual codebase\n- Skips important verification steps before marking work complete\n\nThis plugin makes Claude more methodical and complete with complex work.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n**Investigate before implementing**\n\n- Gather comprehensive context before jumping to solutions\n- Trace issues through the complete stack to find root causes\n- Distinguish between symptoms and underlying problems\n- Verify observations instead of making assumptions\n\n**Think systematically about scope**\n\n- When you point out one bug, audit the entire file or module for similar patterns\n- Break complex tasks into clear steps with measurable success criteria\n- Consider related components that might be affected\n- Look for the pattern behind single instances\n\n**Verify work actually functions**\n\n- Run tests and show you the actual output, not just \"tests should pass\"\n- Execute code in realistic scenarios, not just isolated unit tests\n- Check that original problems no longer occur\n- Confirm no regressions were introduced\n\n**Complete all verification before claiming \"done\"**\n\n- Provide evidence that solutions work in practice\n- Test edge cases and error handling\n- Update documentation to reflect changes\n- Meet clear completion criteria before reporting success\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill                 | Purpose                                                                                            |\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `agent-orchestration` | Scientific delegation framework for coordinating sub-agents with observation-based context patterns |\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install agent-orchestration@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - it works automatically. You'll notice the difference when you give Claude tasks like:\n\n**\"Fix this bug\"**\n\n- Claude investigates the root cause thoroughly\n- Looks for similar bugs in related code\n- Verifies the fix actually works with real test execution\n- Checks for regressions in dependent functionality\n\n**\"Add this feature\"**\n\n- Claude breaks down the work into clear steps\n- Considers integration with existing systems\n- Tests both success and failure scenarios\n- Provides evidence each acceptance criterion is met\n\n**\"Refactor this code\"**\n\n- Claude ensures tests pass before starting\n- Verifies behavior remains identical after changes\n- Checks performance isn't degraded\n- Confirms no new issues were introduced\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Fix the authentication bug in login.py\"\nClaude: [reads file, makes change]\nClaude: \"I've fixed the issue by updating the validation logic.\n        The code should work now.\"\n```\n\nLater you discover the same bug exists in three other files, tests are actually failing, and the fix only addressed a symptom.\n\n**With this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Fix the authentication bug in login.py\"\nClaude: [investigates root cause]\nClaude: \"I found the validation issue in login.py. This pattern\n        appears in 4 files total. Let me audit and fix all instances.\"\nClaude: [fixes all instances, runs tests]\nClaude: \"Fixed authentication validation in login.py, signup.py,\n        reset_password.py, and api_auth.py. All tests passing:\n\n        pytest output:\n        ====== 47 passed in 2.3s ======\n\n        Root cause was missing email format validation before\n        database query. Applied consistent validation across all\n        auth entry points.\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe plugin guides Claude to:\n\n- Base decisions on verified observations rather than assumptions\n- Define clear success criteria before starting work\n- Investigate comprehensively using all available tools\n- Provide concrete evidence that solutions actually function\n- Think about scope systematically (one bug often indicates a pattern)\n\nThis results in more complete, reliable solutions with less back-and-forth iteration.\n",
        "plugins/brainstorming-skill/README.md": "# Brainstorming Skill\n\nMakes Claude significantly better at generating ideas and creative solutions.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you ask Claude to brainstorm, you might get:\n\n- Generic ideas that don't fit your constraints\n- Shallow suggestions without reasoning\n- Just a few options when you need many perspectives\n- Blue-sky thinking that ignores your budget or timeline\n\nThis plugin fixes that by teaching Claude 30+ research-validated brainstorming techniques.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Generate 20-30% more ideas than before (research-validated improvement)\n- Apply structured thinking patterns automatically - role-based perspectives, constraint exploration, analogical thinking\n- Provide reasoning for each idea, making it easier to evaluate and implement\n- Work within your actual constraints (budget, time, resources) instead of ignoring them\n- Break through creative blocks by using inversion, extreme scaling, and cross-domain analogies\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install brainstorming-skill@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - it works automatically when you brainstorm. Claude will recognize when you're:\n\n- Planning marketing campaigns or content\n- Designing product features\n- Solving problems creatively\n- Making strategic decisions\n- Writing creatively (plots, characters, themes)\n- Generating test cases\n\nYou'll notice Claude asking clarifying questions about your constraints and stakeholders before generating ideas.\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**:\nYou: \"Help me brainstorm features for a project management app\"\nClaude: \"Here are some ideas: task lists, calendar view, team chat, file sharing...\"\n_(Generic features, no reasoning, ignores your context)_\n\n**With this plugin**:\nYou: \"Help me brainstorm features for a project management app\"\nClaude: \"To generate the most relevant ideas, what's your budget and timeline? Who are your primary users?\"\nYou: \"$20k budget, 6 weeks, targeting freelancers\"\nClaude: \"I'll generate ideas from three perspectives using constraint-based thinking:\n\n**From freelancer perspective** (5 ideas with implementation estimates):\n\n1. Invoice generation integrated with time tracking - $3k, 1 week\n   _Reasoning: Freelancers cited invoicing as #1 pain point, this addresses billing friction directly_\n2. Client portal with branded workspace - $4k, 1.5 weeks\n   _Reasoning: Builds trust, reduces email back-and-forth by 60% per user research_\n\n**From accountant perspective** (5 ideas)...\n**From client perspective** (5 ideas)...\n\nEach idea includes reasoning, cost estimate, and implementation time within your constraints.\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n",
        "plugins/clang-format/README.md": "# clang-format Configuration\n\nHelps Claude configure clang-format to match your existing code style instead of forcing a style on you.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nSetting up code formatting typically means:\n\n- Massive whitespace-only commits that pollute git history\n- Breaking every in-progress feature branch\n- Days of bikeshedding about brace styles and indent width\n- Copy-pasting config files from the internet and hoping they work\n\nThis plugin changes that. Claude will analyze your existing code, measure the impact of different configurations, and show you exactly what will change before applying anything.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Analyze your existing code style before suggesting any formatting configuration\n- Test multiple configuration options and score them by impact (line changes vs whitespace)\n- Show you comparison tables and example diffs before changing anything\n- Ask for your approval before finalizing a configuration\n- Set up editor integration and git hooks automatically\n- Know all 194 clang-format options without needing to search documentation\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install clang-format@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust ask Claude naturally. The plugin works automatically.\n\n### Generate Configuration from Existing Code\n\n**You say**: \"Set up clang-format for this C++ project, but don't change the existing style\"\n\n**Claude will**:\n\n1. Examine multiple files in your codebase\n2. Identify brace styles, indentation, spacing patterns\n3. Generate several configuration hypotheses\n4. Test each one and measure impact (line changes + whitespace changes)\n5. Show you a comparison table with scores\n6. Present example diffs showing what will change\n7. Ask for approval before creating `.clang-format`\n\n### Set Up Format-on-Save\n\n**You say**: \"Set up clang-format to run automatically in my editor\"\n\n**Claude will**: Pick the right integration for your editor (Vim, Emacs, VS Code) and set it up correctly.\n\n### Add Git Hook\n\n**You say**: \"Make clang-format run before I commit\"\n\n**Claude will**: Set up a pre-commit hook that formats only staged files.\n\n### Troubleshoot Formatting\n\n**You say**: \"Why is clang-format putting my braces in weird places?\"\n\n**Claude will**: Check your configuration, identify the relevant options, explain what's happening, and suggest fixes.\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**: You ask \"add clang-format\". Claude copies a random config file from the internet. You apply it. 2,847 lines change across 93 files. Your git history is now useless.\n\n**With this plugin**: Same request, but Claude:\n\n- Analyzes 5 files in your codebase\n- Tests 3 configuration approaches\n- Reports: \"Config A: 34 line changes, Config B: 12 line changes, Config C: 8 line changes\"\n- Shows you diffs of what will change in each config\n- Recommends Config C\n- Waits for your approval\n\nYou approve. Claude creates `.clang-format`. You apply it. 8 lines change (real formatting fixes, not whitespace churn). Your git history stays clean.\n\n## What's Included\n\nThis plugin bundles:\n\n- 7 ready-to-use configuration templates (Google, Linux kernel, Microsoft, modern C++, etc.)\n- 3 editor/git integration scripts\n- Complete reference documentation for all clang-format options\n- Systematic workflows for analyzing code style\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- clang-format installed (`apt install clang-format` / `brew install clang-format`)\n",
        "plugins/commitlint/README.md": "# Commitlint\n\nHelps Claude work with your commitlint configuration and generate valid commit messages.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nIf your project uses commitlint to enforce commit message standards, Claude needs this plugin to:\n\n- Understand your specific commitlint rules and configuration\n- Generate commit messages that pass your validation checks on the first try\n- Help you set up or modify commitlint configuration correctly\n- Explain commitlint validation errors when they occur\n\nWithout this plugin, Claude might generate commit messages that fail your commitlint checks, requiring multiple attempts to get it right.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Read and understand your commitlint configuration files (commitlint.config.js, .commitlintrc, etc.)\n- Know which commit types are allowed in your project (feat, fix, docs, etc.)\n- Follow your header length limits, scope rules, and formatting requirements\n- Generate commit messages that match your exact conventions\n- Help you configure commitlint with the correct syntax and rule format\n- Explain what went wrong when commitlint rejects a commit message\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install commitlint@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - it works automatically. Claude will detect commitlint configuration in your project and apply those rules.\n\nYou'll notice the difference when you:\n\n- Ask Claude to create a commit\n- Request help setting up commitlint\n- Ask Claude to explain a commitlint error\n- Need to configure custom commit message rules\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**: You say \"create a commit for these changes\". Claude writes `\"Updated the authentication system\"` which fails because your project requires conventional commit format with type prefix.\n\n**With this plugin**: Same request. Claude reads your commitlint.config.js, sees you require conventional commits with types [feat, fix, docs, refactor], and generates: `\"feat: add OAuth2 authentication support\"` which passes validation immediately.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- Project using commitlint (optional, but this plugin is most useful when commitlint is configured)\n",

        "plugins/holistic-linting/README.md": "# Holistic Linting\n\nMakes Claude automatically check and fix code quality issues before completing tasks.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you ask Claude to write or modify code, Claude sometimes:\n\n- Says \"all done!\" but leaves linting errors in the code\n- Adds `# type: ignore` or `# noqa` comments to silence errors instead of fixing them\n- Forgets to run formatters and linters before finishing\n- Doesn't know which linters your project uses\n\nThis plugin makes Claude treat code quality checks as a required part of every task.\n\n## What You Get\n\n### Claude Improvements\n\nWith this plugin, Claude will:\n\n**Automatically verify code quality** - Before marking any code task complete, Claude formats and lints the files it modified. No more \"done!\" messages with linting errors left behind.\n\n**Investigate root causes** - When linting errors appear, Claude researches the rule documentation, examines the code context, and implements proper fixes instead of adding suppression comments.\n\n**Use your project's linters** - Claude discovers which linters your project uses (ruff, mypy, pyright, eslint, prettier, etc.) by scanning your configuration files.\n\n**Delegate systematically** - When you're in the interactive Claude Code CLI, Claude delegates linting resolution to specialized agents that handle formatting, linting, and fixes concurrently.\n\n**Verify fixes work** - After implementing fixes, Claude re-runs linters to confirm issues are actually resolved.\n\n### Commands\n\n#### /lint [files...]\n\nShorthand for activating the holistic-linting skill:\n\n```bash\n/lint src/auth.py\n/lint src/*.py\n/lint path/to/directory/\n```\n\nActivates the full holistic-linting workflow — linter detection, formatting, linting, root-cause resolution via specialized agents, and verification. Equivalent to running `/holistic-linting:holistic-linting` directly with file path arguments.\n\n### Specialized Agents\n\nThis plugin provides two agents that Claude delegates to when orchestrating linting work:\n\n**linting-root-cause-resolver** - Investigates and fixes linting errors. Loads project context, researches rule documentation, follows Python 3.11+ standards, and rewrites code to address underlying issues. Never suppresses errors unless fundamentally unsolvable.\n\n**post-linting-architecture-reviewer** - Reviews linting resolution quality after fixes are complete. Examines resolution artifacts, validates fixes align with codebase patterns, checks type safety improvements, and identifies opportunities for systemic improvements.\n\n### Skills Included\n\nThis plugin provides three complementary skills that work together:\n\n**holistic-linting** - Core skill providing linter detection, formatting workflows, and the rules knowledge base. Entry point for all linting operations.\n\n**holistic-linting-orchestrator** - Delegation workflows for the interactive CLI. Guides Claude on when and how to delegate to linting agents for systematic resolution.\n\n**holistic-linting-resolver** - Linter-specific resolution procedures for sub-agents. Provides systematic workflows for resolving ruff, mypy, and pyright errors with suppression gates and verification steps.\n\n### Included Resources\n\n**Rules Knowledge Base** - Complete documentation for 933+ ruff rules (19 families), mypy error codes (organized by category), and 65+ bandit security checks. Claude references these when researching fixes.\n\n**Resolution Workflows** - Systematic procedures for resolving issues reported by ruff, mypy, pyright, and basedpyright. Includes suppression gates, verification steps, and root-cause analysis patterns.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install holistic-linting@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Automatic Behavior\n\nJust install it. Claude automatically checks code quality when finishing tasks involving code changes.\n\nWhen Claude is orchestrating work (interactive CLI), it delegates to specialized agents that handle all formatting, linting, and resolution work.\n\nWhen Claude is a sub-agent (delegated task), it formats and lints files it modified before marking the task complete.\n\n### Manual Linting\n\nUse `/lint` as a shorthand to activate the holistic-linting skill on specific files:\n\n```bash\n/lint src/auth.py src/utils.py\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**:\n\n```\nYou: \"Add authentication to the API\"\nClaude: [writes code]\nClaude: \"Done! I've added authentication middleware.\"\nYou: [runs ruff check]\nYou: \"There are 5 linting errors...\"\n```\n\n**With this plugin**:\n\n```\nYou: \"Add authentication to the API\"\nClaude: [writes code]\nClaude: [automatically formats and lints modified files]\nClaude: [finds 5 errors, investigates root causes, fixes them]\nClaude: [verifies fixes by re-running linters]\nClaude: \"Done! I've added authentication middleware. All linting checks pass.\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- Python projects: ruff, mypy, pyright, bandit, or similar linters\n- JavaScript/TypeScript projects: eslint, prettier\n- Shell scripts: shellcheck, shfmt\n- Markdown: markdownlint\n- Pre-commit framework: pre-commit or prek\n\n## Supported Linters\n\n**Python**: ruff, mypy, pyright, basedpyright, bandit\n\n**JavaScript/TypeScript**: eslint, prettier\n\n**Shell**: shellcheck, shfmt\n\n**Markdown**: markdownlint\n\n**Pre-commit hooks**: pre-commit, prek\n",
        "plugins/litellm/README.md": "# LiteLLM\n\nHelps Claude write correct Python code when your project calls LLM APIs.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you're building Python applications that need to call LLMs, there are many ways to get it wrong:\n\n- Forgetting the `llamafile/` prefix when connecting to local models\n- Using the wrong API endpoint format\n- Not handling exceptions properly\n- Missing retry logic for unreliable connections\n- Hard-coding a single provider when you want flexibility\n\nWithout this plugin, Claude might suggest code patterns that look reasonable but won't work with your setup.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Use the correct model names and prefixes (like `llamafile/gemma-3-3b`)\n- Connect to your local llamafile server on the right port with the right endpoint format\n- Handle exceptions properly using LiteLLM's OpenAI-compatible error types\n- Add retry logic when needed\n- Set up streaming correctly for async responses\n- Know when to use sync vs async patterns\n- Configure environment variables correctly\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install litellm@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - it works automatically. Claude will use this knowledge when you're writing Python code that involves LLMs.\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**: You say \"connect this Python script to my local llamafile server\". Claude might write:\n\n```python\nresponse = litellm.completion(\n    model=\"gemma-3-3b\",  # Wrong - missing prefix\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\n    api_base=\"http://localhost:8000\",  # Wrong port\n)\n```\n\nThis code fails because the model name needs the `llamafile/` prefix and llamafile runs on port 8080 by default.\n\n**With this plugin**: Same request, Claude writes:\n\n```python\nresponse = litellm.completion(\n    model=\"llamafile/gemma-3-3b\",  # Correct prefix\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}],\n    api_base=\"http://localhost:8080/v1\",  # Correct port and endpoint\n    timeout=30.0,\n    num_retries=3,\n)\n```\n\nThis works immediately and includes timeout and retry handling.\n\n## When This Helps\n\nThis plugin is most useful when you're:\n\n- Building CLI tools that need to call LLMs (like commit message generators)\n- Writing Python apps that use local models via llamafile\n- Creating services that might switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models\n- Adding LLM features to existing Python projects\n- Setting up retry/fallback logic for production systems\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- Python 3.11+ (for your project - this plugin is just documentation)\n",

Automatic Behaviors\n\nOnce installed, Claude automatically applies these improvements when working with Python code:\n\n**Modern Python Patterns**:\n- Uses `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`\n- Applies `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`\n- Leverages pattern matching for complex conditionals\n- Implements proper `async/await` patterns for I/O-bound work\n\n**Library Selection**:\n- CLI apps: Typer + Rich (progress bars, formatted output)\n- HTTP clients: httpx (async support, modern API)\n- JSON handling: orjson (faster than stdlib)\n- Configuration: pydantic-settings (typed config)\n- Testing: pytest + pytest-mock + hypothesis\n\n**Project Structure**:\n- `packages/` directory for multi-package repos\n- `pyproject.toml` with hatchling build backend\n- `uv` for dependency management (10-100x faster than pip)\n- PEP 723 inline metadata for standalone scripts\n\n**Testing Philosophy**:\n- Investigates failures instead of auto-fixing tests\n- Considers both test bugs and implementation bugs\n- Writes tests before implementation (TDD)\n- Uses mutation testing for critical code paths\n\n**Code Quality**:\n- Runs ruff for linting and formatting\n- Applies mypy for type checking\n- Eliminates `Any` types progressively\n- Follows DRY and SRP principles\n\n### Specialized Skills\n\nThe plugin includes 25 skills that guide Claude's behavior:\n\n| Skill | What It Does |\n|-------|--------------|\n| `python3-development` | Core orchestration and modern Python patterns |\n| `python3-test-design` | Test suite architecture and strategy |\n| `async-python-patterns` | Master asyncio and async/await for high-performance apps |\n| `uv` | Astral uv package manager expert guidance |\n| `hatchling` | Comprehensive hatchling build backend documentation |\n| `mkdocs` | MkDocs documentation project creation and management |\n| `pre-commit` | Configure git hooks using pre-commit or prek |\n| `pypi-readme-creator` | Generate PyPI-compliant README files |\n| `toml-python` | Work with TOML using tomlkit (preserves formatting) |\n| `validation-protocol` | Scientific validation protocol for verifying fixes |\n| `implementation-manager` | Query and manage feature task status |\n| `planner-rt-ica` | Planning-phase input completeness analysis |\n\nAnd more specialized skills for code review, packaging, bug fixing, and feature development.\n\n### Specialized Agents\n\nThe plugin provides 16 agents Claude can delegate to for specialized tasks:\n\n| Agent | Specialization |\n|-------|----------------|\n| `python-cli-architect` | Build CLIs with Typer and Rich |\n| `python-pytest-architect` | Create and modernize test suites |\n| `python-code-reviewer` | Review code for quality and best practices |\n| `context-gathering` | Gather comprehensive context for implementation |\n| `codebase-analyzer` | Explore patterns and write structured analysis |\n| `ecosystem-researcher` | Research domain ecosystems and technology landscapes |\n| `feature-researcher` | Research features and produce discovery context |\n| `feature-verifier` | Goal-backward verification after implementation |\n| `integration-checker` | Verify cross-module integration and end-to-end flows |\n| `plan-validator` | Validate implementation plans before execution |\n| `code-reviewer` | Holistic code review after implementation |\n| `doc-drift-auditor` | Audit documentation accuracy against code |\n| `context-refinement` | Update task context with implementation discoveries |\n| `service-documentation` | Update CLAUDE.md and module documentation |\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - Claude uses it automatically when working with Python code.\n\n### With Commands\n\nInvoke specific workflows directly:\n\n```bash\n# Improve code quality progressively\n/python3-development:stinkysnake src/myapp/\n\n# Add a new feature with TDD\n/python3-development:python3-add-feature \"Add rate limiting to API\"\n\n# Review test coverage\n/python3-development:comprehensive-test-review tests/\n\n# Set up PyPI publishing\n/python3-development:python3-publish-release-pipeline github\n```\n\n### Automatic Application\n\nClaude automatically uses this plugin when you:\n\n- Ask to create Python files\n- Request code reviews\n- Work with Python projects\n- Debug Python issues\n- Add features to Python codebases\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**:\n\nYou say: \"Build a CLI tool to process CSV files\"\n\nClaude creates:\n- `argparse` for CLI (verbose, dated API)\n- Plain text output\n- `List[str]` and `Optional[str]` syntax\n- Code in `src/` directory\n- When test fails, immediately changes test to match implementation\n\n**With this plugin**:\n\nSame request, but Claude:\n\n1. **Gathers context**: Checks for existing project structure, dependencies\n2. **Plans approach**: Designs CLI with Typer, identifies output format needs\n3. **Implements modern code**:\n   - Typer + Rich (progress bars, formatted tables)\n   - `list[str]` and `str | None` native syntax\n   - Code in `packages/csv_tool/`\n   - Comprehensive type hints\n   - PEP 723 metadata for standalone script option\n4. **Tests first**: Writes pytest tests before implementation\n5. **Investigates failures**: When test fails, analyzes whether it's a test bug or real bug before deciding what to fix\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nThe plugin includes extensive reference documentation:\n\n- **50+ Modern Python Libraries**: Usage patterns and best practices for asyncio, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, pydantic, httpx, typer, rich, and more\n- **User Project Conventions**: Extracted patterns from real-world production projects\n- **Tool & Library Registry**: Development tools for linting, testing, build automation\n- **API References**: Integration guides for common APIs\n- **Workflow Patterns**: TDD, feature addition, refactoring, code review\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- Python 3.11+ recommended (for modern syntax patterns)\n\n## Development Continuity\n\nIf interrupted mid-development and need to resume workflow work (command→skill migration, vendoring):\n\n- [Workflow Port Plan](./skills/python3-development/planning/python3-development-workflow-port-plan.md)\n",
        "plugins/verification-gate/README.md": "# Verification Gate\n\nMakes Claude investigate before acting instead of jumping to solutions.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nClaude sometimes identifies the problem correctly but then applies the wrong fix. This happens when Claude recognizes an error pattern and immediately applies a \"standard solution\" from its training data without checking if that solution matches your specific project setup.\n\nExamples of what goes wrong without this plugin:\n\n- You get \"module not found\" error. Claude sees it's a PEP 723 script but runs `uv sync` (which updates pyproject.toml instead of the PEP 723 inline dependencies)\n- Your config isn't working. Claude modifies the config file without checking that your app reads environment variables first\n- Package won't import. Claude runs `pip install` globally when your script uses a virtualenv\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Read relevant files before trying to fix things\n- Verify its diagnosis before taking action\n- Check that its fix actually targets the system it identified as the problem\n- Catch when it's about to apply a \"common pattern\" that doesn't match your project\n\nThis makes Claude slower to execute but much more accurate.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install verification-gate@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it - it works automatically. You'll notice the difference when Claude:\n\n- Sees an error and reads files first instead of immediately running commands\n- States what it thinks the problem is and then gathers evidence\n- Explains what system it's targeting before making changes\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: This PEP 723 script can't find the pydantic module\nClaude: I'll install the dependencies\nClaude: [Runs uv sync immediately]\nResult: Doesn't work - uv sync operates on pyproject.toml, not PEP 723\n```\n\n**With this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: This PEP 723 script can't find the pydantic module\nClaude: Let me check the script first\nClaude: [Reads the script file]\nClaude: I can see the PEP 723 inline dependencies block. I'll add pydantic there.\nClaude: [Edits the # /// script block in the file]\nResult: Works correctly\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n- Claude will be slower (2-3 extra file reads before each action)\n- Claude will explain its reasoning more (adds verbosity)\n- Fixes will be more accurate (fewer debugging cycles)\n- Overall time saved despite slower start\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n",
        "plugins/xdg-base-directory/README.md": "# XDG Base Directory\n\nMakes Claude organize application files properly on Linux and Unix systems.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you ask Claude to build CLI tools or Python applications, it might:\n\n- Clutter your home directory with files like `~/.myapp-config`\n- Hardcode paths instead of respecting your environment settings\n- Mix configuration files with cache data\n- Break when you try to customize file locations\n\nThis plugin teaches Claude the standard Linux file organization conventions.\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will:\n\n- Store config files in `~/.config/appname/` instead of `~/.appname`\n- Put data files in `~/.local/share/appname/`\n- Put cache in `~/.cache/appname/`\n- Put log files in `~/.local/state/appname/`\n- Respect your XDG environment variables if you've customized them\n- Validate paths correctly (absolute paths only, per specification)\n- Handle cross-platform storage when using the platformdirs library\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install xdg-base-directory@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust install it and it works automatically. You'll notice the difference when you ask Claude to:\n\n- \"Create a CLI tool that saves configuration\"\n- \"Build a Python app that downloads and caches data\"\n- \"Write a script that logs user history\"\n- \"Make this app respect XDG environment variables\"\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin**:\n\n```python\n# Claude might write this\nconfig_file = Path.home() / '.myapp' / 'config.toml'\n```\n\nResult: Your home directory fills up with dotfiles.\n\n**With this plugin**:\n\n```python\n# Claude writes this instead\ndef get_config_dir() -> Path:\n    xdg = os.environ.get('XDG_CONFIG_HOME')\n    base = Path(xdg) if xdg and Path(xdg).is_absolute() else Path.home() / '.config'\n    return base / 'myapp'\n\nconfig_file = get_config_dir() / 'config.toml'\n```\n\nResult: Clean home directory, proper organization, respects your customizations.\n\n## What You Get\n\n- Proper file organization following Linux standards\n- Clean home directory (no more scattered dotfiles)\n- Environment variable support for custom locations\n- Correct handling of config vs data vs cache vs state\n- Cross-platform awareness with platformdirs\n- Test code that validates XDG compliance\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- Works best for Linux/Unix development\n- Also covers cross-platform apps (macOS, Windows) when using platformdirs\n",
        "plugins/plugin-creator/README.md": "# Plugin Creator & Refactoring Toolkit\n\nComplete plugin development toolkit for creating, refactoring, and validating Claude Code plugins. Combines plugin creation, systematic refactoring workflows, and comprehensive validation tools.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis plugin provides end-to-end capabilities for plugin development:\n\n**Plugin Creation:**\n\n- Step-by-step guidance for creating new plugins\n- Frontmatter validation and auto-fixing\n- Structure scaffolding and template generation\n\n**Plugin Refactoring:**\n\n- Analyze plugin structure and identify issues\n- Create detailed refactoring plans\n- Execute tasks via specialized agents\n- Validate refactoring completeness\n\n**Validation Tools:**\n\n- Comprehensive frontmatter schema validation\n- Skill structure and quality checks\n- Internal link validation\n- Line count enforcement\n\n## ⚠️ Critical Bug Discovery: Skill Name Field (Plugin Skills Only)\n\n**Discovered:** 2026-01-29\n**Claude Code Version:** v2.1.23\n**Scope:** **Only affects plugin skills** - does NOT affect `.claude/skills/` directories\n\n### The Bug\n\n**Plugin skills** with an explicit `name:` field in their frontmatter **DO NOT appear as slash commands**, even when `user-invocable: true` is set.\n\n**Important:** This bug only affects skills distributed via plugins. Skills in `.claude/skills/` (personal/project) work fine with or without the `name:` field.\n\n**Symptoms (Plugin Skills Only):**\n\n- Skill in plugin's `skills` array\n- Skill has `user-invocable: true`\n- Skill has `name: skill-name` in frontmatter\n- **Result:** `/plugin-name:skill-name` does NOT appear in autocomplete\n\n**Not Affected:**\n\n- Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` (user-level) ✓\n- Skills in `.claude/skills/` (project-level) ✓\n- These work fine with `name:` field\n\n**Workaround (For Plugin Skills):**\n\n```yaml\n# ❌ BROKEN - skill won't appear as slash command\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: Does something useful\nuser-invocable: true\n---\n\n# ✅ WORKS - skill appears as slash command\n---\ndescription: Does something useful\nuser-invocable: true\n---\n```\n\nClaude Code automatically uses the directory name, so omitting `name:` allows proper slash command registration.\n\n### Automatic Fix\n\nThe `plugin-validator.py` script now automatically removes `name:` fields from SKILL.md files:\n\n```bash\nuv run ./scripts/plugin-validator.py fix ./skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n✓ Removed 'name' field (Claude Code bug: skills with 'name' field don't appear as slash commands)\n```\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this plugin when:\n\n- Creating new plugins, skills, commands, or agents\n- Validating frontmatter in SKILL.md or agent files\n- A skill exceeds 500 lines and needs splitting\n- Skills cover multiple distinct domains\n- Agent descriptions have weak triggers\n- Plugin structure needs reorganization\n- Systematically improving plugin quality\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Creating Plugins\n\n```bash\n# Generate new plugin structure\nuv run ./scripts/create_plugin.py\n\n# Validate frontmatter\nuv run ./scripts/plugin-validator.py validate ./skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n\n# Auto-fix common frontmatter issues\nuv run ./scripts/plugin-validator.py fix ./skills/my-skill/SKILL.md\n```\n\n### Refactoring Plugins\n\n```bash\n# Quick

lines - consider splitting\n- **Critical**: >800 lines - must split\n\n### Skill Split Requirements\n\nWhen splitting skills:\n\n- No content loss (100% migration)\n- Cross-references between new skills\n- Original skill becomes facade/meta-skill\n- Backwards compatibility maintained\n\n### Frontmatter Requirements\n\n**Skills:**\n\n- `name`: Optional (uses directory name if omitted)\n- `description`: Optional (uses first paragraph if omitted)\n- Valid tool/model values if specified\n\n**Agents:**\n\n- `name`: Required (lowercase, hyphens)\n- `description`: Required (trigger keywords)\n- `model`: One of sonnet/opus/haiku/inherit\n- `tools`: Comma-separated string (not array)\n\n## Plugin System Fundamentals\n\n### Plugin Caching and File Resolution\n\nClaude Code copies plugins to a cache directory rather than using them in-place for security and verification.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n- Marketplace plugins: The `source` path is copied recursively\n- Plugins with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: The directory containing `.claude-plugin/` is copied recursively\n\n**Path traversal limitations:**\n\n- Plugins cannot reference files outside their directory (`../shared-utils` will fail)\n- External files are not copied to the cache\n\n**Solutions for external dependencies:**\n\n1. **Use symlinks:** Create symlinks within your plugin directory (symlinks are followed during copy)\n\n   ```bash\n   ln -s /path/to/shared-utils ./shared-utils\n   ```\n\n2. **Restructure marketplace:** Set source to parent directory that contains all required files\n\n### Installation Scopes\n\nWhen installing a plugin, choose a scope that determines availability:\n\n| Scope     | Settings file                 | Use case                                                 |\n| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `user`    | `~/.claude/settings.json`     | Personal plugins available across all projects (default) |\n| `project` | `.claude/settings.json`       | Team plugins shared via version control                  |\n| `local`   | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Project-specific plugins, gitignored                     |\n| `managed` | `managed-settings.json`       | Managed plugins (read-only, update only)                 |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Install to user scope (default)\nclaude plugin install plugin-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills\n\n# Install to project scope (shared with team)\nclaude plugin install plugin-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills --scope project\n\n# Install to local scope (gitignored)\nclaude plugin install plugin-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills --scope local\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`:** Absolute path to your plugin directory. Use in hooks, MCP servers, and scripts.\n\n**`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`:** Project root directory (where Claude Code was started).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PostToolUse\": [{\n      \"hooks\": [{\n        \"type\": \"command\",\n        \"command\": \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/process.sh\"\n      }]\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### CLI Commands Reference\n\n**Install plugin:**\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install <plugin> [--scope user|project|local]\n```\n\n**Uninstall plugin:**\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin uninstall <plugin> [--scope user|project|local]\n# Aliases: remove, rm\n```\n\n**Enable/disable plugin:**\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin enable <plugin> [--scope user|project|local]\nclaude plugin disable <plugin> [--scope user|project|local]\n```\n\n**Update plugin:**\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin update <plugin> [--scope user|project|local|managed]\n```\n\n**Validate plugin:**\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin validate <plugin-directory>\n/plugin validate <plugin-directory>  # In session\n```\n\n### Testing Without Installation\n\n```bash\n# Load plugin for current session only\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/plugin-creator\n\n# Load multiple plugins\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugin-one --plugin-dir ./plugin-two\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# From marketplace (user scope - default)\n/plugin install plugin-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills\n\n# Install to project scope (shared with team)\nclaude plugin install plugin-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills --scope project\n\n# For development (session only)\nclaude --plugin-dir ./plugins/plugin-creator\n```\n\n## Example Sessions\n\n### Creating a New Plugin\n\n```bash\n# Generate plugin structure interactively\nuv run ./scripts/create_plugin.py\n\n# Validate the generated frontmatter\nuv run ./scripts/plugin-validator.py batch ./my-new-plugin\n\n# Validate plugin manifest\nclaude plugin validate ./my-new-plugin\n```\n\n### Refactoring an Existing Plugin\n\n```bash\n# 1. Check skill sizes\n/plugin-creator:count-lines ./plugins/python3-development\n\n# Output shows skills over 500 lines\n\n# 2.

        "plugins/hallucination-detector/README.md": "# Hallucination Detector\n\nPrevents Claude from finishing tasks with speculation, unverified claims, or invented causality.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nClaude sometimes delivers responses that sound confident but contain:\n\n- Speculation disguised as diagnosis (\"This is probably caused by...\")\n- Invented causality without evidence (\"The error occurs because...\")\n- Fake quantification without methodology (\"This improves performance by 70%\")\n- Completeness overclaims without verification (\"All files have been checked\")\n\nThese patterns are difficult to catch because they sound authoritative. This plugin forces Claude to ground its statements in actual observations before completing a task.\n\n## The Problem\n\nLLMs like Claude are optimized during training to produce responses that _appear_ helpful and confident. This creates a systematic failure mode:\n\n**Speculation as diagnosis** - When asked \"why did X happen?\", Claude draws on training patterns to generate plausible-sounding explanations. These explanations feel authoritative but may have no connection to the actual state of your system. Claude hasn't checked logs, read config files, or verified anything - it's pattern-matching from training data.\n\n**Invented causality** - Causal claims (\"X because Y\") require evidence showing the relationship. Claude often asserts causality based on what _typically_ causes similar symptoms, not what _actually_ caused this specific instance. The word \"because\" in Claude's output frequently signals unverified inference.\n\n**Fake rigor** - Scores and percentages (\"8/10 quality\", \"70% improvement\") create an illusion of measurement. Without methodology, sample size, and reproducible criteria, these numbers are meaningless - yet they make responses feel more credible.\n\n**Completeness theater** - Claims like \"all files checked\" or \"comprehensive analysis\" are rarely true. Claude may have checked _some_ files, or the _most likely_ files, but stating completeness without enumerating scope is misleading.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nWhen Claude's unverified speculation matches reality by chance, the problem is invisible. When it doesn't match, you've wasted time pursuing a false lead - or worse, made changes based on incorrect diagnosis.\n\nThe cost compounds in agent workflows where sub-agents act on orchestrator hallucinations, or when hallucinated \"facts\" persist across sessions as assumed truth.\n\n### Why a Stop Hook\n\nBehavioral instructions (\"don't speculate\") fail because:\n\n1. Claude's training optimization overrides instructions under completion pressure\n2. Speculation patterns are deeply embedded in how Claude learned to be \"helpful\"\n3. Self-assessment of speculation is unreliable (Claude doesn't recognize its own patterns)\n\nA Stop hook provides **structural enforcement** - Claude cannot complete a task while trigger language is present. This shifts from \"please don't speculate\" (ignorable) to \"speculation blocks completion\" (architectural constraint).\n\n## What Changes\n\nWith this plugin installed, Claude will be blocked from finishing if its response contains:\n\n**Speculation language** - \"I think\", \"probably\", \"likely\", \"seems\", \"should be\", \"maybe\", \"might\"\n\n**Ungrounded causality** - \"because\", \"due to\", \"caused by\", \"therefore\", \"this means\" without cited evidence\n\n**Pseudo-quantification** - Scores like \"8.5/10\" or percentages like \"70% improvement\" without methodology\n\n**Completeness overclaims** - \"all files checked\", \"comprehensive analysis\", \"fully resolved\" without listing what was actually inspected\n\nWhen blocked, Claude must rewrite using evidence-first language:\n\n- \"I observed X in file Y at line Z\"\n- \"I don't know yet\" / \"I can check using my tools\"\n- \"After running command X, the output showed Y\"\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install hallucination-detector@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Automatic Behavior\n\nJust install it - the plugin runs automatically as a Stop hook. Every time Claude attempts to finish a task, its last message is audited for hallucination triggers.\n\nIf triggers are found, Claude is blocked and must rewrite with proper evidence.\n\n### Manual Audit Command\n\nTo manually audit any text (useful for reviewing sub-agent output or draft responses):\n\n```bash\n/hallucination-detector:audit\n```\n\nThen paste the content to audit.\n\n## Example\n\n**Without this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Why is the API returning 500 errors?\"\nClaude: \"This is probably caused by a database connection timeout.\n        The issue is likely due to connection pool exhaustion,\n        which typically happens under high load.\"\n```\n\nClaude confidently explains a cause without having verified anything.\n\n**With this plugin:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Why is the API returning 500 errors?\"\nClaude: [attempts to respond with speculation]\n[BLOCKED by hallucination-detector]\nClaude: \"I don't have enough information yet. Let me check:\n        1. Reading the error logs...\n        2. Checking database connection configuration...\n\n        I found in /var/log/app.log at line 1247:\n        'ConnectionError: max retries exceeded for host db.internal'\n\n        The logs show the API server cannot reach the database host.\n        Next step: verify network connectivity and database status.\"\n```\n\n## What Gets Flagged\n\n| Category     | Triggers                                          | Required Fix                                |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Speculation  | \"I think\", \"probably\", \"likely\", \"seems\", \"maybe\" | State observation or \"I don't know yet\"     |\n| Causality    | \"because\", \"due to\", \"caused by\", \"therefore\"     | Cite specific evidence (file, line, output) |\n| Fake rigor   | \"8/10\", \"70% improvement\"                         | Show methodology or remove                  |\n| Completeness | \"all files checked\", \"fully resolved\"             | List what was actually inspected            |\n\n## What Doesn't Get Flagged\n\nThe plugin avoids false positives by ignoring:\n\n- Code blocks and inline code (might contain example text)\n- Blockquotes (often quoting user or external sources)\n- Questions (\"Should I do that now?\" is fine)\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n- Claude will be blocked if it falls into speculation patterns\n- Responses will be more verbose (evidence must be cited)\n- Claude may need 2-3 rewrites before a response passes\n- After 2 blocks in the same response cycle, the plugin allows completion to prevent infinite loops\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe plugin installs a Stop hook that:\n\n1. Reads the conversation transcript when Claude attempts to stop\n2. Extracts the last assistant message (ignoring tool calls)\n3. Scans for trigger patterns in narrative text\n4. If triggers found, blocks with specific feedback on what to fix\n5. Maintains a per-session counter to prevent infinite blocking loops\n",
        "plugins/uv/README.md": "# uv - Astral's Python Package Manager Expert\n\nSupercharge Claude with comprehensive knowledge of uv, the blazing-fast Python package and project manager that replaces pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, and virtualenv.\n\n## Why Install This?\n\nWhen you ask Claude to help with Python projects, this plugin ensures Claude:\n\n- Creates projects using modern uv workflows instead of outdated pip/virtualenv patterns\n- Writes portable single-file scripts with PEP 723 inline dependency metadata\n- Manages dependencies using lockfiles for reproducible environments\n- Configures CI/CD pipelines with uv best practices\n- Troubleshoots dependency resolution and build failures effectively\n- Migrates existing projects from pip, poetry, or conda to uv\n\nWithout this plugin, Claude may suggest slower, outdated approaches. With it, Claude becomes an expert in modern Python tooling that's 10-100x faster.\n\n## Note: Compatibility Wrapper\n\nThis plugin is a compatibility wrapper. The uv skill was consolidated into the `python3-development` plugin. This plugin provides the same skill via symlink so existing installations continue to work. For new installations, prefer `python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills`.\n\n## What You Get\n\n### Expert Guidance on Modern Python Workflows\n\nClaude will help you with:\n\n**Project Management**\n- Initialize new projects with proper structure (apps, libraries, or bare projects)\n- Configure pyproject.toml with modern dependency groups (PEP 735)\n- Set up workspaces for monorepo projects\n- Build and publish packages to PyPI with PEP 740 attestations\n\n**Dependency Management**\n- Add, remove, and upgrade dependencies with automatic lockfile management\n- Resolve complex dependency conflicts\n- Configure custom package indexes (PyPI, PyTorch, private registries)\n- Handle optional dependency groups and extras\n- Exclude problematic packages from resolution\n- Apply version bounds (compatible, exact, lowest) automatically\n\n**Script Development**\n- Create portable single-file scripts with PEP 723 inline metadata\n- Lock scripts for reproducible execution\n- Run scripts with automatic dependency installation\n- Share executable scripts that work anywhere\n\n**Tool Management**\n- Install command-line tools globally (ruff, black, mypy, httpie)\n- Run tools ephemerally without installation (uvx)\n- Keep tools updated across your system\n\n**Python Version Management**\n- Install and switch between Python versions automatically\n- Support CPython, PyPy, GraalPy, Pyodide, and free-threaded Python (+gil suffix)\n- Pin Python versions per project or globally\n- Compile standard library bytecode for faster startup\n\n**CI/CD Integration**\n- Configure GitHub Actions workflows with uv\n- Set up Docker containers optimized for uv\n- Integrate with pre-commit/prek git hooks\n- Export SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for security audits\n\n**Migration Support**\n- Convert from pip/requirements.txt to modern pyproject.toml\n- Migrate from Poetry with automated tools (uvx migrate-to-uv)\n- Transition from conda environments\n- Update legacy workflows to uv best practices\n\n### Comprehensive Reference Documentation\n\nThe plugin includes detailed reference materials on:\n\n- Complete CLI command reference (all commands, flags, and arguments)\n- Full configuration guide (pyproject.toml settings and environment variables)\n- Common workflow examples (new projects, scripts, migrations, CI/CD)\n- Troubleshooting guide (build failures, cache issues, common pitfalls)\n\n### Version-Aware Knowledge\n\nClaude understands:\n- Latest features in uv 0.10.x (current as of February 2026)\n- Breaking changes and migration paths (e.g., `uv venv --clear` requirement)\n- Deprecated flags and their replacements (e.g., `--project` → `--name`)\n- Feature availability across versions\n\n### Self-Updating Documentation\n\nThis plugin includes a sync script that fetches the latest uv release notes from GitHub and updates the skill documentation automatically:\n\n```bash\n# Check for new releases (dry run)\nuv run scripts/sync-uv-releases.py --dry-run\n\n# Update the skill documentation\nuv run scripts/sync-uv-releases.py\n\n# Force update (bypass cooldown)\nuv run scripts/sync-uv-releases.py --force\n```\n\nThe script annotates each feature with the version it was introduced in, so Claude can compare against whatever uv version you have installed.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add bitflight-devops/claude_skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install uv@jamie-bitflight-skills\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, Claude automatically uses this knowledge when you:\n\n**Start a new Python project:**\n```\nCreate a FastAPI web application with PostgreSQL support\n```\n\nClaude will use `uv init`, configure proper dependencies with `uv add`, and set up a modern project structure.\n\n**Create a portable script:**\n```\nWrite a script that fetches GitHub repo stats using the API\n```\n\nClaude will create a PEP 723 script with inline dependencies that runs anywhere.\n\n**Migrate an existing project:**\n```\nConvert this pip-based project to use uv\n```\n\nClaude will migrate requirements.txt to pyproject.toml, set up lockfiles, and update workflows.\n\n**Configure CI/CD:**\n```\nSet up GitHub Actions for testing and publishing this package\n```\n\nClaude will create workflows using uv best practices with caching and trusted publishing.\n\n**Troubleshoot issues:**\n```\nuv lock is failing with a dependency conflict\n```\n\nClaude will diagnose the issue and suggest solutions using uv-specific troubleshooting techniques.\n\n## Example: Before and After\n\n**Before (without plugin):**\n```\nUser: Set up a new Python project\nClaude: *creates setup.py, requirements.txt, uses pip and virtualenv*\n```\n\n**After (with plugin):**\n```\nUser: Set up a new Python project\nClaude: I'll create a modern Python project using uv.\n\n*runs:*\nuv init myproject\ncd myproject\nuv add --dev pytest ruff mypy\nuv sync\n\n*creates proper pyproject.toml with dependency groups, lockfile, and .venv*\n```\n\n## What Makes This Different\n\n**Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers all aspects of uv - not just basic commands but advanced features like workspaces, custom indexes, PyTorch backends, SBOM export, and dependency exclusions.\n\n**Modern Standards**: Focuses on current best practices (PEP 723 scripts, PEP 735 dependency groups, lockfile-first workflows).\n\n**Version-Aware**: Includes breaking changes in 0.10.0, deprecated flags, and feature availability across versions.\n\n**Real-World Workflows**: Includes complete examples for CI/CD, Docker, pre-commit integration, and monorepos.\n\n**Troubleshooting Focus**: Dedicated guidance on common errors, cache issues, and migration challenges.\n\n**Auto-Updated**: Sync script keeps documentation current with latest uv releases.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code v2.0+\n- uv installed on your system (Claude can help you install it)\n\n## What This Plugin Doesn't Do\n\nThis plugin provides knowledge and guidance only. It does not:\n- Install uv itself (you need to install uv separately)\n- Add new commands or tools to Claude Code\n- Modify Claude's core behavior outside of Python project tasks\n\n## Real-World Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 1: Data Science Script**\nYou need a script that analyzes CSV files using pandas and matplotlib. Claude creates a PEP 723 script with inline dependencies, locks it for reproducibility, and makes it executable. Share the single file with colleagues - it works on any machine with uv.\n\n**Scenario 2: Web API Development**\nYou're building a FastAPI application. Claude sets up a project with proper dependency groups (production, development, testing), configures uvicorn, adds database libraries, and creates Docker and GitHub Actions configurations using uv best practices.\n\n**Scenario 3: Legacy Migration**\nYou have a 5-year-old project using pip, requirements.txt, and virtualenv. Claude analyzes your dependencies, migrates to pyproject.toml with proper version constraints, sets up lockfiles, and updates CI/CD pipelines to use uv.\n\n**Scenario 4: Monorepo Management**\nYou're building a multi-package project with shared libraries. Claude configures uv workspaces, sets up workspace dependency references, creates a unified lockfile, and shows you how to build specific packages.\n\n**Scenario 5: PyTorch Development**\nYou're building a machine learning project requiring specific CUDA versions. Claude configures custom PyTorch indexes, sets up torch-backend settings for automatic accelerator detection, and creates reproducible environments across different GPU systems.\n\n## Key Concepts Covered\n\n**Projects vs Scripts**\n- Projects: Multi-file applications with pyproject.toml, lockfiles, and virtual environments\n- Scripts: Single-file executables with PEP 723 inline metadata (dependencies embedded in comments)\n\n**Lockfiles**\n- uv.lock ensures reproducible installations across machines\n- Lock scripts with `uv lock --script` for portable execution\n- Upgrade packages with `uv lock --upgrade` or `--upgrade-package`\n\n**Dependency Groups**\n- Production dependencies in `[project.dependencies]`\n- Development tools in `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735)\n- Optional features in `[project.optional-dependencies]`\n\n**Virtual Environments**\n- Auto-created in `.venv/` for projects\n- Ephemeral environments for scripts\n- Global tool environments managed by `uv tool`\n\n**Python Management**\n- Automatic downloads from python.org (CPython, PyPy, GraalPy, Pyodide)\n- Pin versions with `.python-version` files\n- Free-threaded Python support with `+gil` suffix\n\n## Learn More\n\n- uv Documentation: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>\n- uv GitHub: <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>\n- PEP 723 (Inline Script Metadata): <https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/>\n- PEP 735 (Dependency Groups): <https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/>\n- PEP 740 (Attestations): <https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/>\n"
