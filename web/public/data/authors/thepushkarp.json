        "README.md": "# Handoff\n\nPreserve and restore context between Claude Code sessions.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen working with Claude Code across multiple sessions, switching agents, or hitting context limits (auto-compaction), valuable context is lost:\n- What task was being worked on\n- Key decisions and their rationale\n- Blockers and open questions\n- Next steps to continue\n\n## The Solution\n\nHandoff captures \"necessary and sufficient\" context to a `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md` file, enabling seamless continuation across sessions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add thepushkarp/handoff\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install handoff@handoff\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/handoff:create`\n\nCapture current session context to `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md`.\n\n**What it captures:**\n- Current task state (what's in progress)\n- Key decisions and rationale\n- Modified files\n- Blockers and open questions\n- Next steps\n- Critical context (gotchas, patterns, etc.)\n\n**Usage:**\n```\n/handoff:create\n```\n\nThe handoff is **appended with a timestamp**, creating a history log.\n\n### `/handoff:resume`\n\nLoad existing handoff context to continue work.\n\n**Default mode:** Displays handoff summary and asks how to proceed.\n```\n/handoff:resume\n```\n\n**Auto mode:** Automatically loads context and starts working on next steps.\n```\n/handoff:resume --auto\n```\n\n## Automatic Handoff Prompt\n\nThe plugin includes a `PreCompact` hook that **prompts you before context compaction**:\n\n> \"Context is about to be compacted. Would you like me to create a handoff first to preserve important context? (yes/no)\"\n\nThis ensures you never lose important context to auto-compaction.\n\n## Handoff File Format\n\nHandoffs are stored in `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md` with timestamped entries:\n\n```markdown\n---\n\n## Handoff: 2025-01-05 14:32:00\n\n### Current Task State\nImplementing user authentication feature. Login flow is complete, working on password reset.\n\n### Key Decisions\n- Using JWT for session tokens: Better for stateless scaling\n- Email verification required: Security requirement from product\n\n### Modified Files\n- `src/auth/login.ts` - Added JWT generation\n- `src/auth/middleware.ts` - Token validation middleware\n- `tests/auth.test.ts` - Login flow tests\n\n### Blockers / Open Questions\n- Need to decide on password reset token expiry (1hr vs 24hr?)\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Implement password reset endpoint\n2. Add email sending for reset tokens\n3. Write tests for reset flow\n\n### Critical Context\n- The `AUTH_SECRET` env var must be set or tests fail silently\n- Rate limiting is handled in nginx, not in code\n\n---\n```\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Ending a session**: Run `/handoff:create` before closing Claude Code\n2. **Switching contexts**: Create a handoff before switching to a different task\n3. **Context limits**: The PreCompact hook reminds you before auto-compaction\n4. **Team handoffs**: Share `docs/handoff/HANDOFF.md` for async collaboration\n5. **Resuming work**: Run `/handoff:resume` when starting a new session\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Be explicit about blockers**: Include specific questions or decisions needed\n- **Include file paths**: Helps the next session navigate quickly\n- **Note gotchas**: Things that weren't obvious save time later\n- **Use auto mode carefully**: Good for continuing known tasks, but review mode helps verify context is correct\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
