        "plugins/skill-builder/README.md": "# Skill Builder Plugin\n\nA comprehensive guide and toolset for creating effective Claude Code skills with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations.\n\n## What This Plugin Does\n\nThis plugin provides a complete workflow for designing, implementing, and packaging Claude Code skills. It includes:\n\n- **Skill Builder Skill**: Step-by-step guidance for building effective skills\n- **Helper Scripts**: Tools to initialize, validate, and package skills\n- **Templates and Examples**: Starter templates and reference documentation\n\n## Features\n\n- **Comprehensive Skill Creation Workflow**: From understanding requirements to packaging the final skill\n- **Progressive Disclosure Design**: Guidance on organizing SKILL.md, scripts, references, and assets efficiently\n- **Validation and Packaging Tools**: Python scripts to validate skill structure and create distributable packages\n- **Best Practices**: Learn when to use scripts vs references vs assets\n\n## Installation\n\n### From Marketplace\n\n```shell\n/plugin marketplace add jlaswell/claude-community-marketplace\n/plugin install skill-builder@jlaswell-community-marketplace\n```\n\n### Local Development\n\n```shell\n/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-community-marketplace\n/plugin install skill-builder@local\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe skill-builder skill is automatically available to Claude when the plugin is installed. Claude will invoke it when users request help creating or improving skills.\n\n### Invoking the Skill\n\nSimply ask Claude to help create a skill:\n\n```\nUser: Help me build a skill for managing my BigQuery database\nClaude: *invokes skill-builder skill and guides you through the process*\n```\n\n### Using the Helper Scripts\n\nThe skill includes three helper scripts in the `scripts/` directory:\n\n#### 1. Initialize a New Skill\n\n```bash\npython plugins/skill-builder/skills/skill-builder/scripts/init_skill.py my-skill-name --path ./my-skills\n```\n\nThis creates a new skill directory with:\n- Template SKILL.md with frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Example `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` directories\n- Starter files demonstrating proper structure\n\n#### 2. Validate a Skill\n\nValidation runs automatically during packaging, but you can run it standalone:\n\n```bash\npython plugins/skill-builder/skills/skill-builder/scripts/quick_validate.py ./path/to/skill\n```\n\nChecks for:\n- Valid YAML frontmatter format\n- Required fields (name, description)\n- Proper naming conventions (hyphen-case)\n- Description quality\n\n#### 3. Package a Skill\n\n```bash\npython plugins/skill-builder/skills/skill-builder/scripts/package_skill.py ./path/to/skill\n```\n\nCreates a distributable `.zip` file after validation passes. Optionally specify output directory:\n\n```bash\npython plugins/skill-builder/skills/skill-builder/scripts/package_skill.py ./path/to/skill ./dist\n```\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\n1. **Understand with Examples**: Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used\n2. **Plan Reusable Contents**: Identify scripts, references, and assets needed\n3. **Initialize**: Use `init_skill.py` to create the skill structure\n4. **Edit**: Customize SKILL.md and add bundled resources\n5. **Package**: Use `package_skill.py` to validate and create distributable zip\n6. **Iterate**: Test and refine based on real usage\n\n## Progressive Disclosure Design\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (scripts may execute without loading)\n\n## Examples\n\nThis plugin demonstrates best practices for skill organization.
