        "README.md": "# Pro Workflow\n\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rohitg00/pro-workflow?style=social)](https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pro-workflow)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pro-workflow)\n\nBattle-tested AI coding workflows from power users. Self-correcting memory, parallel worktrees, wrap-up rituals, and the 80/20 AI coding ratio. Works with **Claude Code** and **Cursor**.\n\n## The Core Idea\n\n> \"80% of my code is written by AI, 20% is spent reviewing and correcting it.\" — Karpathy\n\nThis skill optimizes for that ratio. Every pattern reduces correction cycles.\n\n## Patterns\n\n| Pattern | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Self-Correction Loop** | Claude learns from your corrections automatically |\n| **Parallel Worktrees** | Zero dead time - work while Claude thinks |\n| **Wrap-Up Ritual** | End sessions with intention, capture learnings |\n| **Split Memory** | Modular CLAUDE.md for complex projects |\n| **80/20 Review** | Batch reviews at checkpoints |\n| **Model Selection** | Opus+Thinking for one-shot accuracy |\n| **Context Discipline** | Manage your 200k token budget |\n| **Learning Log** | Auto-document insights |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Cursor (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n/add-plugin pro-workflow\n```\n\nThe plugin includes 9 skills, 3 agents, and 6 rules that load automatically.\n\n### Claude Code — One-Click Plugin Install\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add rohitg00/pro-workflow\n\n# Install plugin\n/plugin install pro-workflow@pro-workflow\n```\n\nOr via CLI:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add rohitg00/pro-workflow\nclaude plugin install pro-workflow@pro-workflow\n```\n\n### Claude Code — Build with SQLite Support\n\nAfter installation, build the TypeScript for persistent storage:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/*/pro-workflow  # Navigate to plugin directory\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nThis creates the SQLite database at `~/.pro-workflow/data.db`.\n\n### Or load directly\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/pro-workflow\n```\n\n### Manual Setup\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow.git /tmp/pw\ncp -r /tmp/pw/templates/split-claude-md/* ./.claude/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/hooks/* ~/.claude/\n```\n\n### Minimal (Just add to CLAUDE.md)\n\n```markdown\n## Pro Workflow\n\n### Self-Correction\nWhen corrected, propose rule → add to LEARNED after approval.\n\n### Planning\nMulti-file: plan first, wait for \"proceed\".\n\n### Quality\nAfter edits: lint, typecheck, test.\n\n### LEARNED\n```\n\n## Skills (Cursor)\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|:------|:------------|\n| `pro-workflow` | Core 8 workflow patterns for AI-assisted coding |\n| `smart-commit` | Quality gates, staged review, and conventional commits |\n| `wrap-up` | End-of-session ritual with change audit and learning capture |\n| `learn-rule` | Capture corrections as persistent learning rules |\n| `parallel-worktrees` | Set up git worktrees for zero dead time |\n| `replay-learnings` | Surface past learnings relevant to the current task |\n| `session-handoff` | Generate handoff documents for session continuity |\n| `insights` | Session analytics, correction trends, and productivity metrics |\n| `deslop` | Remove AI-generated code slop and clean up style |\n\n## Rules (Cursor)\n\n| Rule | Applies To | Description |\n|:-----|:-----------|:------------|\n| `quality-gates` | Always | Lint, typecheck, and test before commits |\n| `atomic-commits` | Always | Conventional format, feature branches, specific staging |\n| `context-discipline` | Always | Read before edit, plan before multi-file changes |\n| `self-correction` | Always | Capture mistakes as compounding learnings |\n| `no-debug-statements` | `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs}` | Remove console.log, debugger, print before committing |\n| `communication-style` | Always | Concise, action-oriented, no over-engineering |\n\n## Commands (Claude Code)\n\nAfter plugin install, commands are namespaced:\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/pro-workflow:wrap-up` | End-of-session checklist |\n| `/pro-workflow:learn-rule` | Extract correction to memory (file-based) |\n| `/pro-workflow:parallel` | Worktree setup guide |\n| `/pro-workflow:learn` |Claude Code best practices & save learnings |\n| `/pro-workflow:search` |Search learnings by keyword |\n| `/pro-workflow:list` |List all stored learnings |\n| `/pro-workflow:commit` | Smart commit with quality gates and code review |\n| `/pro-workflow:insights` | Session analytics, learning patterns, and correction heatmap |\n| `/pro-workflow:replay` |Surface past learnings for current task |\n| `/pro-workflow:handoff` |Generate session handoff document for next session |\n\n## Database Features\n\n### Persistent Learnings\n\nLearnings are stored in SQLite with FTS5 full-text search:\n\n```\n~/.pro-workflow/\n└── data.db    # SQLite database with learnings and sessions\n```\n\n### Search Examples\n\n```\n/search testing           # Find all testing-related learnings\n/search \"file paths\"      # Exact phrase search\n/search git commit        # Multiple terms\n```\n\n### Learning Categories\n\n- Navigation (file paths, finding code)\n- Editing (code changes, patterns)\n- Testing (test approaches)\n- Git (commits, branches)\n- Quality (lint, types, style)\n- Context (when to clarify)\n- Architecture (design decisions)\n- Performance (optimization)\n- Claude-Code (sessions, modes, CLAUDE.md, skills, subagents, hooks, MCP)\n- Prompting (scope, constraints, acceptance criteria)\n\n## Hooks\n\nAutomated enforcement of workflow patterns.\n\n| Hook | When | What |\n|------|------|------|\n| PreToolUse | Before edits | Track edit count, quality gate reminders |\n| PreToolUse | Before git commit/push | Remind about quality gates, wrap-up |\n| PostToolUse | After code edits | Check for console.log, TODOs, secrets |\n| PostToolUse | After tests | Suggest [LEARN] from failures |\n| UserPromptSubmit | Each prompt |Drift detection — warns when straying from original intent |\n| SessionStart | New session | Load learnings from database |\n| Stop | Each response | Periodic wrap-up reminders |\n| SessionEnd | Session close | Save session stats to database |\n\n### Install Hooks\n\n```bash\n# Full setup with hooks\ngit clone https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow.git /tmp/pw\ncp -r /tmp/pw/hooks/* ~/.claude/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/scripts ~/.claude/scripts/pro-workflow/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/\n```\n\n## Contexts & Agents\n\n| Context | When | Behavior |\n|---------|------|----------|\n| dev | Building | Code first, iterate |\n| review | PRs | Read-only, security focus |\n| research | Exploring | Summarize, plan |\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| planner | Break down complex tasks |\n| reviewer | Code review, security audit |\n| scout |Confidence-gated exploration before implementation |\n\n### Agent Teams (Experimental)\n\nCoordinate multiple Claude Code sessions working together:\n\n```bash\n# Enable in settings.json\n{ \"env\": { \"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\": \"1\" } }\n```\n\n- Lead session coordinates, teammates work independently\n- Teammates message each other directly\n- Shared task list with dependency management\n- Display modes: in-process (`Shift+Up/Down`) or split panes (tmux/iTerm2)\n- Delegate mode (`Shift+Tab`): lead orchestrates only\n- Docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/agent-teams\n\n## Structure\n\n```\npro-workflow/\n├── .claude-plugin/              #
