Self-correcting memory, parallel worktrees, wrap-up rituals, and the 80/20 AI coding ratio.\n\n**If this helps your workflow, please give it a star!**\n\n## The Core Idea\n\n> \"80% of my code is written by AI, 20% is spent reviewing and correcting it.\" — Karpathy\n\nThis skill optimizes for that ratio. Every pattern reduces correction cycles.\n\n## Patterns\n\n| Pattern | What It Does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Self-Correction Loop** | Claude learns from your corrections automatically |\n| **Parallel Worktrees** | Zero dead time - work while Claude thinks |\n| **Wrap-Up Ritual** | End sessions with intention, capture learnings |\n| **Split Memory** | Modular CLAUDE.md for complex projects |\n| **80/20 Review** | Batch reviews at checkpoints |\n| **Model Selection** | Opus+Thinking for one-shot accuracy |\n| **Context Discipline** | Manage your 200k token budget |\n| **Learning Log** | Auto-document insights |\n\n## Installation\n\n### One-Click Plugin Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Add marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add rohitg00/pro-workflow\n\n# Install plugin\n/plugin install pro-workflow@pro-workflow\n```\n\nOr via CLI:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add rohitg00/pro-workflow\nclaude plugin install pro-workflow@pro-workflow\n```\n\n### Or load directly\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/pro-workflow\n```\n\n### Manual Setup\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow.git /tmp/pw\ncp -r /tmp/pw/templates/split-claude-md/* ./.claude/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/hooks/* ~/.claude/\n```\n\n### Minimal (Just add to CLAUDE.md)\n\n```markdown\n## Pro Workflow\n\n### Self-Correction\nWhen corrected, propose rule → add to LEARNED after approval.\n\n### Planning\nMulti-file: plan first, wait for \"proceed\".\n\n### Quality\nAfter edits: lint, typecheck, test.\n\n### LEARNED\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nAfter plugin install, commands are namespaced:\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `/pro-workflow:wrap-up` | End-of-session checklist |\n| `/pro-workflow:learn-rule` | Extract correction to memory |\n| `/pro-workflow:parallel` | Worktree setup guide |\n\n## Hooks\n\nAutomated enforcement of workflow patterns.\n\n| Hook | When | What |\n|------|------|------|\n| PreToolUse | Before edits | Track edit count, quality gate reminders |\n| PreToolUse | Before git commit/push | Remind about quality gates, wrap-up |\n| PostToolUse | After code edits | Check for console.log, TODOs, secrets |\n| PostToolUse | After tests | Suggest [LEARN] from failures |\n| SessionStart | New session | Load LEARNED patterns |\n| Stop | Each response | Periodic wrap-up reminders |\n| SessionEnd | Session close | Check uncommitted changes |\n\n### Install Hooks\n\n```bash\n# Full setup with hooks\ngit clone https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow.git /tmp/pw\ncp -r /tmp/pw/hooks/* ~/.claude/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/scripts ~/.claude/scripts/pro-workflow/\ncp -r /tmp/pw/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/\n```\n\n## Contexts & Agents\n\n| Context | When | Behavior |\n|---------|------|----------|\n| dev | Building | Code first, iterate |\n| review | PRs | Read-only, security focus |\n| research | Exploring | Summarize, plan |\n\n| Agent | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| planner | Break down complex tasks |\n| reviewer | Code review, security audit |\n\n## Structure\n\n```\npro-workflow/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   ├── plugin.json           # Plugin manifest\n│   ├── marketplace.json      # Marketplace config\n│   └── README.md\n├── skills/\n│   └── pro-workflow/\n│       └── SKILL.md          # Main skill\n├── agents/\n│   ├── planner.md\n│   └── reviewer.md\n├── commands/\n│   ├── wrap-up.md\n│   ├── learn-rule.md\n│   └── parallel.md\n├── hooks/\n│   └── hooks.json\n├── scripts/                  # Hook scripts\n├── contexts/\n│   ├── dev.md\n│   ├── review.md\n│   └── research.md\n├── rules/\n│   └── core-rules.md\n├── templates/\n│   └── split-claude-md/\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## SkillKit - Universal AI Skills\n\n**One skill. 32+ AI coding agents.** Install pro-workflow across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more with [SkillKit](https://agenstskills.com).\n\n```bash\n# Install this skill\nnpx skillkit install pro-workflow\n\n# Translate to any agent format\nnpx skillkit translate pro-workflow --agent cursor\n\n# Get AI-powered skill recommendations\nnpx skillkit primer\n```\n\n**Why SkillKit?**\n- Install once, use everywhere\n- 15,000+ skills in the marketplace\n- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and 27+ more agents\n\nExplore the marketplace at [agenstskills.com](https://agenstskills.com)\n\n## Philosophy\n\n1. **Compound improvements** - Small corrections → big gains over time\n2. **Trust but verify** - Let AI work, review at checkpoints\n3. **Zero dead time** - Parallel sessions keep momentum\n4. **Memory is precious** - Both yours and Claude's\n\n---\n\n## Support\n\nIf you find this useful:\n- **Star this repo** to help others discover it\n- Check out [SkillKit](https://agenstskills.com) for more AI coding skills\n- [Report issues](https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow/issues) or suggest improvements\n\n---\n\n*Distilled from Claude Code power users and real production use.*\n"
