GSD 2.0 adds multi-model intelligence, adaptive context loading, and rollback/recovery features while preserving the original philosophy.*\n\n### From the Original Creator\n\n> *\"I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.*\n>\n> *Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.*\n>\n> *So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.*\n>\n> *The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work and verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.*\n>\n> *That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.\"*\n>\n> — **TÂCHES** ([@glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy))\n\n---\n\n## What's New in 2.0\n\nGSD 2.0 builds on the solid foundation of the original with AI-powered enhancements:\n\n### Multi-Model Intelligence\nAutomatic routing to the optimal model for each operation:\n- **Haiku** for fast validation, file checks, progress tracking (92% cost savings on routine ops)\n- **Sonnet** for standard execution, planning, code generation (default)\n- **Opus** for architectural decisions, project initialization, complex debugging\n\n### Adaptive Context Loading\nLoad only what's needed, when it's needed:\n- **5-tier system**: Minimal → Planning → Execution → Brownfield → Full\n- **Subsystem detection**: Auto-loads relevant docs based on task keywords\n- **Dependency graphs**: Frontmatter-based smart context assembly\n- **30% token savings** with less noise in context\n\n### Rollback & Recovery\nSafety net for experimentation:\n- **Git checkpoints**: Auto-created before/after each plan execution\n- **One-command rollback**: `/gsd:rollback last` or `/gsd:rollback 02-01`\n- **Intelligent recovery**: `/gsd:recover` diagnoses and fixes interrupted states\n- **Backup tags**: Undo-the-undo capability\n\n### Analysis-Driven Design\n2.0 was created through comprehensive analysis:\n- 22 commands, 13 workflows, 22 templates, 9 reference documents analyzed\n- Competitive research: BMAD v6, GitHub SpecKit, Anthropic best practices\n- See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full methodology and changes\n\n---\n\nVibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.\n\nGSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.\n\n---\n\n## Who This Is For\n\nPeople who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\nnpx get-shit-done-cc\n```\n\nThat's it. Verify with `/gsd:help`.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)</strong></summary>\n\n```bash\nnpx get-shit-done-cc --global   # Install to ~/.claude/\nnpx get-shit-done-cc --local    # Install to ./.claude/\n```\n\nUse `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the interactive prompt.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Development Installation</strong></summary>\n\nClone the repository and run the installer locally:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done.git\ncd get-shit-done\nnode bin/install.js --local\n```\n\nInstalls to `./.claude/` for testing modifications before contributing.\n\n</details>\n\n### Recommended: Skip Permissions Mode\n\nGSD is designed for frictionless automation. Run Claude Code with:\n\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> This is how GSD is intended to be used — stopping to approve `date` and `git commit` 50 times defeats the purpose.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Alternative: Granular Permissions</strong></summary>\n\nIf you prefer not to use that flag, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Bash(date:*)\",\n      \"Bash(echo:*)\",\n      \"Bash(cat:*)\",\n      \"Bash(ls:*)\",\n      \"Bash(mkdir:*)\",\n      \"Bash(wc:*)\",\n      \"Bash(head:*)\",\n      \"Bash(tail:*)\",\n      \"Bash(sort:*)\",\n      \"Bash(grep:*)\",\n      \"Bash(tr:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git add:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git commit:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git status:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git log:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git diff:*)\",\n      \"Bash(git tag:*)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Start with an idea\n\n```\n/gsd:new-project\n```\n\nThe system asks questions. Keeps asking until it has everything — your goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases. You go back and forth until the idea is fully captured. Creates **PROJECT.md**.\n\n### 2. Create roadmap\n\n```\n/gsd:create-roadmap\n```\n\nProduces:\n- **ROADMAP.md** — Phases from start to finish\n- **STATE.md** — Living memory that persists across sessions\n\n### 3. Plan and execute phases\n\n```\n/gsd:plan-phase 1      # System creates atomic task plans\n/gsd:execute-plan      # Subagent implements autonomously\n```\n\nEach phase breaks into 2-3 atomic tasks. Each task runs in a fresh subagent context — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero degradation.\n\n### 4. Ship and iterate\n\n```\n/gsd:complete-milestone   # Archive v1, prep for v2\n/gsd:add-phase            # Append new work\n/gsd:insert-phase 2       # Slip urgent work between phases\n```\n\nShip your MVP in a day. Add features. Insert hotfixes. The system stays modular — you're never stuck.\n\n---\n\n## Existing Projects (Brownfield)\n\nAlready have code? Start here instead.\n\n### 1. Map the codebase\n\n```\n/gsd:map-codebase\n```\n\nSpawns parallel agents to analyze your code. Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 documents:\n\n| Document | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `STACK.md` | Languages, frameworks, dependencies |\n| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Patterns, layers, data flow |\n| `STRUCTURE.md` | Directory layout, where things live |\n| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Code style, naming patterns |\n| `TESTING.md` | Test framework, patterns |\n| `INTEGRATIONS.md` | External services, APIs |\n| `CONCERNS.md` | Tech debt, known issues, fragile areas |\n\n### 2. Initialize project\n\n```\n/gsd:new-project\n```\n\nSame as greenfield, but the system knows your codebase. Questions focus on what you're adding/changing, not starting from scratch.\n\n### 3. Continue as normal\n\nFrom here, it's the same: `/gsd:create-roadmap` → `/gsd:plan-phase` → `/gsd:execute-plan`\n\nThe codebase docs load automatically during planning. Claude knows your patterns, conventions, and where to put things.\n\n---\n\n## Why It Works\n\n### Context Engineering\n\nClaude Code is incredibly powerful *if* you give it the context it needs. Most people don't.\n\nGSD handles it for you:\n\n| File | What it does |\n|------|--------------|\n| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |\n| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you're going, what's done |\n| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |\n| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |\n| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |\n| `ISSUES.md` | Deferred enhancements tracked across sessions |\n\nSize limits based on where Claude's quality degrades. Stay under, get consistent excellence.\n\n### XML Prompt Formatting\n\nEvery plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:\n\n```xml\n<task type=\"auto\">\n  <name>Create login endpoint</name>\n  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>\n  <action>\n    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).\n    Validate credentials against users table.\n    Return httpOnly cookie on success.\n  </action>\n  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>\n  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>\n</task>\n```\n\nPrecise instructions. No guessing. Verification built in.\n\n### Subagent Execution\n\nAs Claude fills its context window, quality degrades. You've seen it: *\"Due to context limits, I'll be more concise now.\"* That \"concision\" is code for cutting corners.\n\nGSD prevents this. Each plan is maximum 3 tasks. Each plan runs in a fresh subagent — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage.\n\n| Task | Context | Quality |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| Task 1 | Fresh | ✅ Full |\n| Task 2 | Fresh | ✅ Full |\n| Task 3 | Fresh | ✅ Full |\n\nNo degradation. Walk away, come back to completed work.\n\n### Atomic Git Commits\n\nEach task gets its own commit immediately after completion:\n\n```bash\nabc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan\ndef456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow\nhij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing\nlmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.\n\nEvery commit is surgical, traceable, and meaningful.\n\n### Modular by Design\n\n- Add phases to current milestone\n- Insert urgent work between phases\n- Complete milestones and start fresh\n- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything\n\nYou're never locked in. The system adapts.\n\n---\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| `/gsd:new-project` | Extract your idea through questions, create PROJECT.md |\n| `/gsd:create-roadmap` | Create roadmap and state tracking |\n| `/gsd:map-codebase` | Map existing codebase for brownfield projects |\n| `/gsd:plan-phase [N]` | Generate task plans for phase |\n| `/gsd:execute-plan` | Run plan via subagent |\n| `/gsd:progress` | Where am I?
