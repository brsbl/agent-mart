        "README.md": "# Claude Agent System\n\n**Turn Claude into your personal development team.** Plugin skills that handle everything — from deep planning through implementation to code review, with parallel agent swarms and automatic quality gates.\n\n> **v7.0.0 — Plugin-Only Distribution**\n>\n> The Claude Agent System is now distributed exclusively as a **Claude Code plugin**. The legacy script-based command system (`.claude/commands/`, `.claude/workflows/`, `.claude/middleware/`, setup scripts) has been fully retired. All functionality is preserved through 6 plugin skills listed below.\n>\n> If you previously installed via the setup script, uninstall the old files and switch to the plugin:\n> ```bash\n> rm -rf .claude/commands .claude/workflows .claude/middleware .claude/agents\n> /plugin marketplace add Kasempiternal/Claude-Agent-System\n> /plugin install cas\n> ```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add Kasempiternal/Claude-Agent-System\n/plugin install cas\n```\n\nDone! You now have 6 skills: `/zk`, `/pcc`, `/pcc-opus`, `/hydra`, `/review`, and `/systemcc`.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Vibe Coding Philosophy\n\n**\"Vibe coding\"** = typing a prompt, accepting whatever the AI outputs, hoping it works.\n\n**This system is the opposite.** Every skill enforces structure:\n\n| What Vibe Coding Does | What This System Does |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Blindly accepts AI output | Parallel code review agents |\n| No validation | Build config detection + linting enforcement |\n| No learning | Session memory - learns your patterns and mistakes |\n| No quality gates | Decision engines with complexity/risk/scope analysis |\n| Hope it works | Post-execution validation + auto-fix critical issues |\n\n---\n\n# Skills\n\n## `/zk` - Intelligent Router\n\nThe smart entry point. Analyzes your request and **auto-routes** to the best execution mode — no manual skill selection needed.\n\n```bash\n/zk \"what you want to do\"\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\nZK walks a deterministic 4-step decision tree:\n\n| Step | Condition | Routes To |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 | Multiple independent deliverables? | `/hydra` |\n| 2 | Scale word + broad noun (\"entire codebase\")? | `/hydra` |\n| 3 | High-stakes keyword + qualifying signal? | `/pcc-opus` |\n| 4 | Everything else (default) | `/pcc` |\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n/zk add a button to the settings page          # -> PCC (simple, clear scope)\n/zk refactor the payment processing system      # -> PCC-Opus (keyword + risk domain)\n/zk migrate all models to SwiftData             # -> PCC-Opus (\"migrate\" always qualifies)\n/zk fix auth; add dashboard; update API         # -> Hydra (3 independent tasks)\n/zk modernize the entire codebase               # -> Hydra (scale + broad scope)\n```\n\n**Escape hatch**: You can always bypass ZK and invoke `/pcc`, `/pcc-opus`, or `/hydra` directly.\n\n---\n\n## `/pcc` and `/pcc-opus` - Parallel Claude Coordinator\n\nAn orchestrator that spawns agent swarms for exploration and implementation.\n\n```bash\n/pcc \"implement user authentication with JWT tokens\"\n/pcc-opus \"refactor the entire payment processing system\"\n```\n\n### Two Variants\n\n| Variant | Scouts | Implementers | Best For |\n|---------|--------|-------------|----------|\n| `/pcc` | **Sonnet** (fast, cost-efficient) | **Opus** (high quality) | Most tasks |\n| `/pcc-opus` | **Opus** (maximum depth) | **Opus** (high quality) | Critical systems, unfamiliar codebases |\n\n### How PCC Works\n\n1. **Task Understanding** - Clarifies the task with you\n2. **Parallel Exploration** - Spawns 2-6 scout agents to map the codebase\n3. **Synthesis** - Combines findings into unified understanding\n4. **Clarification** - Asks questions if multiple valid approaches exist\n5. **Plan Creation** - Creates editable plan at `.claude/plans/{task}.md`\n6. **User Review** - You edit and approve the plan before any code is written\n7. **Parallel Implementation** - Spawns 2-6 Opus agents working simultaneously\n8. **Verification** - Tests and code review\n9. **Simplification** - 2-6 parallel agents clean up the code\n10. **Final Report** - Summarizes everything\n\n---\n\n## `/hydra` - Multi-Task Parallel Swarm\n\nSubmit **N tasks at once**. Hydra plans them together, detects cross-task file conflicts, then deploys implementation swarms in dependency-ordered **waves** — fully parallel where files don't overlap, sequentially ordered where they do.\n\n> **Requires Agent Teams**: Hydra uses the experimental Agent Teams feature (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in `~/.claude/settings.json`). It will check for this setting on startup and guide you through enabling it if needed.\n\n> **High Token Usage Warning**: Hydra spawns multiple Opus-level agents in parallel swarms, which can result in **very high token consumption**. Recommended only for **MAX plan** subscribers.\n\n```bash\n/hydra add auth; build dashboard; fix payments\n/hydra 1. refactor models 2. add API endpoints 3. update tests\n```\n\n### Best For\n\n- Multiple independent tasks in the same project\n- Batch implementation sprints\n- When tasks might share files (Hydra detects and resolves conflicts)\n\n### How Hydra Works\n\n1. **Prerequisites Check** - Verifies `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`\n2. **Task Parsing** - Splits input into N discrete tasks\n3. **Team Init** - Creates team + tasks for all N items\n4. **Parallel Exploration** - Shared pool of Opus scout teammates explores for all N tasks\n5. **Delegated Synthesis** - Analyst teammate writes N plans + coordination file, resolves conflicts\n6. **User Review** - You review summary + plan files, then confirm\n7. **Wave Implementation** - Per wave: analyst prepares specs, orchestrator spawns impl agents\n8. **Per-Wave Verification** - Tests after each wave; global integration check after all waves\n9. **Simplification** - Module-grouped cleanup across all task boundaries\n10. **Final Report & Cleanup** - Per-task status, shutdown teammates, clean up\n\n### Features\n\n- **Agent Teams powered** — structured coordination with TeamCreate, TaskCreate, SendMessage\n- **Cross-task file conflict analysis** — builds a DAG of file ownership at plan time\n- **Wave-based execution** — parallel where safe, sequential where files overlap\n- **Shared scout pool** — Opus scouts explore for all N tasks simultaneously\n- **Per-task plans + coordination file** — editable before implementation\n- **Module-grouped simplification** — ensures cross-task code consistency\n\n---\n\n## `/review` - Code Review Swarm\n\nDeploys **7 parallel review agents** to analyze your code, then **automatically fixes** CRITICAL and MAJOR findings with your approval. Uses official Anthropic review plugin agents when available, with bundled fallback agents for standalone use.\n\n```bash\n/review                  # Review all uncommitted changes (default)\n/review staged           # Review only staged changes\n/review src/auth.ts      # Review specific file(s)\n/review \"auth module\"    # Review files matching a description\n```\n\n### Review Agents\n\nAll 7 agents run in parallel (same wall-clock time as running one):\n\n| Agent | What It Checks |\n|-------|---------------|\n| Bug & Logic Reviewer | Security vulnerabilities, crashes, logic errors, resource leaks |\n| Code Reviewer | Code quality, readability, maintainability, best practices |\n| Project Guidelines Reviewer | Style conventions, CLAUDE.md standards, best practices |\n| Silent Failure Hunter | Swallowed exceptions, bad fallbacks, inadequate error handling |\n| Comment Analyzer | Stale docs, misleading comments, missing documentation |\n| Type Design Analyzer | Encapsulation, invariant expression, type safety |\n| Test Coverage Analyzer | Test gaps, missing edge cases, test quality |\n\n### What You Get\n\nThe orchestrator synthesizes all 7 agent reports into a consolidated review:\n\n- **Health score** (0-10) with severity-weighted formula\n- **Agent verdicts table** - quick pass/fail per agent\n- **Deduplicated findings** - overlapping issues merged, multi-agent flags boost confidence\n- **Cross-agent correlation** - related findings from different agents grouped together\n- **Severity-prioritized** - CRITICAL > MAJOR > MINOR\n\n### Fix Phase (Opt-In)\n\nIf CRITICAL or MAJOR findings are found, the system asks how you want to proceed:\n\n- **Fix CRITICAL and MAJOR** (default) - parallel fix agents resolve high-severity findings\n- **Fix ALL** - also addresses MINOR findings (style, comments, naming)\n- **Report only** - keep the report without modifying code\n\nFix agents are grouped by file (exclusive ownership, no conflicts) and make minimum changes to resolve each finding. `/review` never modifies code without your explicit consent.\n\n### Optional: Official Anthropic Agents\n\n`/review` works standalone with bundled agents, but installing these official plugins enhances the analysis:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official\n/plugin install code-simplifier@claude-plugins-official\n```\n\n---\n\n## `/systemcc` - Auto-Routing Workflow Selector\n\nThe catch-all convenience command. Auto-analyzes task complexity, risk, and scope to select and execute the optimal workflow automatically.\n\n```bash\n/systemcc \"what you want to do\"\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Lyra AI Optimization** - Enhances your request with the 4-D methodology\n2. **Build Config Detection** - Scans Makefile, CI/CD, linters and applies rules\n3. **Two-Phase Decision Engine** - Domain detection first, then complexity scoring\n4. **Automatic Execution** - Runs all phases without manual intervention\n5. **Triple Code Review** - 3 parallel reviewers check quality\n6. **Summary** - What changed and why\n\n### Features\n\n- 3-dimensional task analysis (complexity, risk, scope)\n- Two-phase decision engine with confidence scoring\n- Lyra AI prompt optimization (4-D methodology)\n- Build configuration auto-detection and enforcement\n- Automatic workflow selection and execution\n- Triple code review (Senior Engineer, Lead Engineer, Architect)\n\n---\n\n# When to Use Each Skill\n\n| Situation | Use This |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Don't want to choose** — let the system pick | `/zk` |\n| Single well-defined task | `/pcc` |\n| Critical systems, unfamiliar codebases | `/pcc-opus` |\n| Multiple independent tasks at once | `/hydra` (or `/zk` auto-detects) |\n| Code review before committing | `/review` |\n| Want auto-routing with Lyra AI optimization | `/systemcc` |\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
