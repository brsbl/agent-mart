        "README.md": "# Skillify\n\n> Save context window by extracting verbose sections into on-demand skills\n\nA Claude Code skill that helps you modularize large instruction files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, commands, agents) by extracting verbose sections into focused, on-demand skills. Also amplifies terse \"use X\" instructions into comprehensive guidance via web research.\n\n## Why Skillify?\n\nLarge instruction files consume valuable context window space *every time* Claude loads them. Skillify solves this by:\n\n1. **Extracting verbose sections** (>30 lines) into separate skills that load only when needed\n2. **Amplifying terse instructions** like \"use Chrome DevTools MCP\" into comprehensive guidance\n3. **Preserving originals** - your files become leaner with skill references, not deleted\n\n**Result:** Your CLAUDE.md stays lean (~100 tokens in metadata), while detailed guidance loads on-demand (<5k tokens when needed).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add kevnk/skillify\n/plugin install skillify@skillify\n```\n\nOr install directly:\n\n```bash\n/plugin add https://github.com/kevnk/skillify.git\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```\n/skillify                           # Process CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md\n/skillify path/to/command.md        # Process specific file\n/skillify file1.md file2.md         # Process multiple files\n```\n\n### What It Does\n\n1. **Analyzes** your file for extractable modules and amplification candidates\n2. **Plans** what to extract vs. keep inline (presents for approval)\n3. **Researches** terse instructions via web search (parallel agents)\n4. **Creates** focused skills in `.claude/skills/`\n5. **Updates** original file with skill references\n6. **Reports** context savings (before/after line counts)\n\n### Example Transformation\n\n**Before (verbose in CLAUDE.md):**\n```markdown\n## Document Template\n\n### File Naming Convention\nLocation: `thoughts/shared/research/`\nFormat: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`\n...\n[45 more lines of template details]\n```\n\n**After (lean with skill reference):**\n```markdown\n## Document Template\n\n**See skill: `research-document-template`** for structure and metadata.\n\nWrite to `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`\n```\n\n## Bundled References\n\nThe skill includes comprehensive guidance in `references/`:\n\n| Reference | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `skill-decomposition-guide.md` | Decomposing bloated SKILL.md files |\n| `skillify-decision-guide.md` | Extraction vs amplification criteria |\n| `task-orchestration-patterns.md` | Task tracking patterns for commands |\n| `task-agent-patterns.md` | Agent spawning and prompt patterns |\n| `skill-structure-guide.md` | SKILL.md format and best practices |\n| `skillify-examples.md` | Example extractions and report format |\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Your CLAUDE.md or instruction files are **too long**\n- You want to **reduce always-loaded context**\n- Files contain **brief \"use X\" instructions** that need expansion\n- You're **modularizing commands** into reusable skills\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
