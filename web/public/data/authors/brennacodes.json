        "README.md": "# brenna-plugs\n\n![installs](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbrennacodes%2Fbrenna-plugs%2Fmain%2F.github%2Fdata%2Fclones.json&query=%24.total&label=installs&color=brightgreen)\n\nA Claude Code plugin marketplace by [brennacodes](https://github.com/brennacodes).\n\nThree plugins for building a professional reputation from the ground up. Log what you do, practice talking about it, write about it publicly. Each plugin works on its own, but together they create a single source of truth — log an experience once, and it flows into interview prep, resume building, and blog posts without re-telling the story from scratch every time.\n\n**i-did-a-thing** is the foundation. You log professional experiences — accomplishments, lessons learned, expertise developed, decisions made, influence exercised, and insights formed — through a guided deep-dive, and the plugin builds a searchable arsenal of evidence tagged, classified, and pre-formatted for reuse. Every entry generates resume bullets, interview talking points, and a blog seed automatically.\n\n**what-did-you-do** reads that arsenal and uses it to coach you. When you practice an interview question, it cross-references your logged evidence — matching question themes to the right evidence types (lessons for failure questions, decisions for tradeoff questions, expertise for depth questions). When you run a mock interview for Amazon, it maps your arsenal to their Leadership Principles and shows where you're strong and where you have gaps.\n\n**mark-my-words** turns the same logs into public writing. The `from-things` skill pulls a log's narrative structure and metrics into a blog post draft — you choose the angle, and it handles the transformation from structured career evidence to an engaging first-person story on your Quartz site.\n\nThe loop compounds: logging more evidence makes your interviews sharper and your writing richer. Practicing interviews exposes gaps to log. Writing about what you've done forces you to articulate impact clearly — which makes you better at interviews.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace from GitHub:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add brennacodes/brenna-plugs\n```\n\nOr from a local clone:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add <path_to_brenna_plugs>\n```\n\nThen install plugins:\n\n```\n/plugin install i-did-a-thing@brenna-plugs\n```\n\n```\n/plugin install what-did-you-do@brenna-plugs\n```\n\n```\n/plugin install mark-my-words@brenna-plugs\n```\n\n```\n/plugin install screenshotr@brenna-plugs\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\n### i-did-a-thing\n\nLog professional experiences — accomplishments, lessons, expertise, decisions, influence, and insights — and build tailored resumes from your evidence arsenal.\n\n**Setup** — Configure your .things directory, git remote, professional goals, and preferences.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\n**Log a Thing** — Capture a professional experience through a guided deep-dive.

        "plugins/i-did-a-thing/README.md": "# i-did-a-thing\n\nLog professional experiences — accomplishments, lessons, expertise, decisions, influence, and insights — and build tailored resumes from your evidence arsenal.\n\nNot everything worth remembering is a win. A hard lesson, deep expertise on a topic, a tough call you can articulate, influence you exercised without authority, or a pattern you noticed — all of these are interview gold and career evidence. The plugin captures each type through a guided deep-dive tailored to what kind of thing it is, then stores it as a structured, searchable log. The plugin automatically maintains skill-level arsenal summaries, pre-written resume bullets, interview talking points, and blog seeds from every entry. Log once, reuse everywhere.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add i-did-a-thing\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nConfigure your .things directory (project-local or global), git remote, professional profile (current role, target roles, skills you're building), and preferences.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n**Log a Thing** — Capture a professional experience with context-aware speed. If you paste a rich transcript, decision summary, or detailed description — or if the conversation already has relevant context — the skill extracts log fields automatically, shows you a summary, and confirms before writing. Only asks about genuinely missing details. For sparse context, it falls back to a full guided deep-dive that adapts based on what kind of thing it is: accomplishments get Context-Action-Result questions, lessons explore what went wrong and what you took from it, expertise entries dig into depth and teaching, decisions walk through options and tradeoffs, influence entries cover advocacy and outcomes, and insights explore observations and theses. Classifies by impact level and category, auto-generates tags, and writes a structured log with resume bullets, interview talking points, and a blog seed. Use `--interview` to force the full interview even when context is available.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:thing-i-did [description, pasted context, or --interview]\n```\n\n**Build Resume** — Analyze a job listing (URL or pasted text), match it against your logged evidence, and produce a tailored resume. Weights evidence types by what the listing emphasizes — technical depth surfaces expertise entries, learning agility surfaces lessons, sound judgment surfaces decisions. Shows you strong matches, partial matches, and gaps. Pulls resume bullets directly from your logs in their type-appropriate format. Optionally generates cover letter talking points and a gap action plan that suggests specific evidence types to log.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:construct-resume [job listing URL or text]\n```\n\n## Evidence Types\n\n| Type | What it captures |\n|------|-----------------|\n| `accomplishment` | You did something with a measurable outcome |\n| `lesson` | Something didn't go as planned, but you extracted value |\n| `expertise` | You went deep on a topic and became a resource |\n| `decision` | You evaluated options, made a judgment call, and can articulate why |\n| `influence` | You shaped someone else's decision, advocated for a change, or mentored someone |\n| `insight` | You noticed a pattern, formed a thesis, developed a perspective |\n\n## How It Works\n\nEach entry is logged via a guided deep-dive whose questions adapt to the evidence type. Logs are stored as markdown files with rich frontmatter in your `.things` directory.\n\nThe plugin automatically maintains:\n\n- **Arsenal files** — skill-level summaries with evidence from your logs, tagged by evidence type, updated as you log new things\n- **An index** — searchable, sorted by date, tag, impact level, and evidence type\n- **Resume bullets** — pre-written bullets generated with each log entry in the type-appropriate format\n\nLogs include a Blog Seed section for use with `/mark-my-words:from-things`, and the celebration step points you to `/what-did-you-do:practice` for interview rehearsal.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n<things_path>/\n├── logs/           # Individual log entries\n├── arsenal/        # Synthesized skill summaries (auto-generated)\n├── targets/        # Professional goal tracking and profile\n└── index.md        # Auto-generated index of all logs\n```\n\nHooks automatically rebuild the index and update arsenal files after every new log.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in `.claude/i-did-a-thing.local.md`.

        "plugins/what-did-you-do/README.md": "# what-did-you-do\n\nInterview preparation with persona-driven practice, company-specific mock interviews, spaced repetition question selection, and progress tracking — powered by your i-did-a-thing arsenal.\n\nDifferent from generic interview prep because it knows what you've actually done. When you answer a question, it cross-references your logged accomplishments, points out evidence you forgot to mention, flags metrics you could have cited, and identifies skills you demonstrated but didn't articulate. Over time, spaced repetition targets your weakest areas and tracks improvement across scoring dimensions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add what-did-you-do\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nLink to your i-did-a-thing data, set follow-up depth (concise, detailed, or coaching), default interview stage, and trusted sources for question bank updates.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n**Practice** — Drill a single question with a selected interviewer persona. Questions are chosen via spaced repetition — weighted toward your weak areas, filtered to avoid recent repeats, and boosted for aspirational skills. Feedback scores five dimensions and references your arsenal.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:practice [behavioral|technical|leadership|situational|system-design]\n```\n\n**Mock Interview** — Simulate a full interview round. Multiple timed questions from a consistent persona with no feedback between questions — just like the real thing. Comprehensive debrief at the end with per-question scores, company value alignment, and action items. Supports Amazon, Google, Meta, and custom company profiles.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:mock [amazon|google|meta] [--stage phone-screen|onsite|bar-raiser]\n```\n\n**Review Readiness** — Analyze all your sessions to produce a readiness assessment. Dimension trends (improving, stable, declining), category breakdowns, persistent anti-pattern tracking, skill coverage gaps, and company-specific calibration against level expectations.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:review [--company amazon|google|meta] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]\n```\n\n**Prep For** — Build a preparation plan for a specific company. Maps your arsenal to their values, walks through each interview stage with persona and format details, predicts likely questions, and generates a practice timeline scaled to when your interview is.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:prep-for <company> [--role <target role>] [--level <level>]\n```\n\n**Update Questions** — Add questions from trusted external sources or manual entry. Validates against your trusted domains, deduplicates against existing questions, and auto-generates metadata (skills tested, difficulty, follow-ups, red/green flags).\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:update-questions <url or 'manual'>\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Personas\n\nSeven interviewer personas shape how questions are asked and feedback is delivered. Each persona has distinct evaluation weights, follow-up patterns, and anti-pattern detection:\n\n- **Staff Engineer** — technical depth, tradeoffs, system thinking\n- **Engineering Manager** — collaboration, communication, growth\n- **Principal Engineer** — multi-year strategy, organizational impact\n- **VP of Engineering** — business alignment, strategic leadership\n- **CTO** — technical vision, competitive strategy\n- **Recruiter** — motivation, culture fit, communication clarity\n- **Bar Raiser** — judgment, ownership, consistency across angles\n\n### Question Bank\n\n45 built-in questions across five categories (behavioral, technical, system-design, leadership, situational) with rich metadata: skills tested, difficulty, follow-ups at multiple depths, red/green flags, time budgets, and level/stage filtering.\n\nQuestions are selected using spaced repetition — weighted toward your weak areas, filtered to avoid recent repeats, and boosted for aspirational skills.\n\n### Company Profiles\n\nBuilt-in profiles for Amazon (14 Leadership Principles), Google, and Meta define each company's values with interview signals and anti-patterns, full interview process with stage-by-stage format and persona mappings, and level expectations. Custom company profiles are supported.\n\n### Scoring\n\nEvery answer is scored on five dimensions:\n\n- **Specificity** — concrete details vs vague claims\n- **Structure** — clear narrative arc (STAR/CAR format)\n- **Impact** — quantified outcomes and scope\n- **Relevance** — actually answers the question asked\n- **Self-Advocacy** — owns contribution without hogging credit\n\n### Session Logging\n\nEach session is saved as an individual file with full frontmatter: per-dimension scores, anti-patterns detected with examples, arsenal cross-references, unlogged accomplishment hints, and comparison to previous attempts.\n\n### Progress Tracking\n\nA rolling readiness dashboard tracks dimension averages, trends, category breakdowns, and persistent anti-patterns across all sessions.\n\n## Session Data\n\nStored alongside your i-did-a-thing data:\n\n```\n<things_path>/interview-prep/\n├── sessions/           # One file per practice or mock session\n├── progress.md         # Rolling readiness dashboard\n├── companies/          # User-created company profiles\n└── question-overrides/ # Custom questions\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in `.claude/what-did-you-do.local.md`. Run setup again to reconfigure.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **i-did-a-thing** — Log the accomplishments that power your interview feedback\n- **mark-my-words** — Turn your accomplishments into blog posts\n",
        "plugins/mark-my-words/README.md": "# mark-my-words\n\nWrite, manage, and publish blog posts on Quartz static sites — with rich media support for images, diagrams, and video embeds.\n\nHandles the full lifecycle — drafting new posts, editing existing ones, managing tags and draft status, and publishing. Works with both local Quartz directories and remote git repos. If you use i-did-a-thing, the `from-things` skill can turn your evidence logs into blog posts, pulling in the narrative structure, metrics, and reflection you've already captured.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add mark-my-words\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nConfigure your Quartz blog source (local path or git remote), content directory, author info, default tags, and git workflow preferences.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:setup\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n**New Post** — Write a new blog post. Walks you through title, length, key points, tags, and draft status, then generates a Quartz-compatible post with proper frontmatter and structure.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:new-post [topic or idea]\n```\n\n**Update Post** — Edit an existing post. Supports targeted section edits, appending content, full rewrites, and metadata-only changes. Preserves your original voice for partial edits.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:update-post [filename or search term]\n```\n\n**Manage Posts** — List all posts with metadata, view and publish drafts, and organize tags across your blog (add, remove, rename tags in bulk).\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:manage-post [list, drafts, publish, tags]\n```\n\n**Create Voice** — Build a voice profile from your writing samples. Analyzes your tone, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and habits to create a compact style guide that makes posts sound like you.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:create-voice [voice name]\n```\n\n**Update Voice** — Refine an existing voice profile with new samples, manual edits, or a full regeneration.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:update-voice [voice name]\n```\n\n**From Things** — Transform i-did-a-thing evidence logs into blog posts. Pulls in the Blog Seed hook, narrative structure, and metrics from your logs. You choose the angle — tutorial, retrospective, or one of the angles suggested in the log itself.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:from-things [log filename or search query]\n```\n\n**Add Media** — Add images, Mermaid diagrams, and video embeds to an existing post. Analyzes your post for visual opportunities and walks you through each one — generate diagrams, provide your own images, search the web, or embed videos.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:add-media [post filename or search term]\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nPosts are written in Quartz-compatible markdown with full frontmatter (title, date, description, tags, draft status, author). The plugin handles git workflows (auto, ask, or manual) based on your configuration. Rich media — Mermaid diagrams, images, GIFs, and video embeds — can be added during writing or to existing posts.\n\nThe `from-things` skill bridges your i-did-a-thing evidence logs into narrative blog posts — choose an angle, and it transforms structured log data into an engaging first-person story.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in `.claude/mark-my-words.local.md` and include source type, content directory, author, default tags, git workflow (auto, ask, or manual), and default voice profile. Run setup again to reconfigure.\n\n### Voice Profiles\n\nVoice profiles live at `.claude/voices/<name>.md` and teach mark-my-words how you write. Create profiles from your existing writing samples, then set a default voice so all new posts match your style. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them when creating posts.\n\n### Media Support\n\nConfigure a `media_dir` in setup to enable image management. When set, the writing and editing skills can add Mermaid diagrams, download and reference images, and embed videos. Auto-suggest mode detects visual opportunities as you write. AI image generation is available as an opt-in when MCP tools are present.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **i-did-a-thing** — Log professional experiences that feed into blog posts via `from-things`\n- **what-did-you-do** — Practice talking about your work in interviews\n",
