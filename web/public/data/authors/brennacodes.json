Every entry auto-generates resume bullets, interview talking points, and a blog seed. A PostToolUse hook rebuilds the JSON index and skill arsenal after every log.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/i-did-a-thing:setup` | Configure .things directory, git remote, professional profile |\n| `/i-did-a-thing:thing-i-did` | Log an experience (context-aware — extracts from conversation or runs full interview) |\n| `/i-did-a-thing:construct-resume` | Match your evidence against a job listing and build a tailored resume |\n| `/i-did-a-thing:migrate-things` | Migrate from v2.x per-plugin configs to centralized shared config |\n\nSix evidence types: accomplishment, lesson, expertise, decision, influence, insight. Each gets tailored interview questions, resume bullet formats, and body section structures.\n\n---\n\n### what-did-you-do\n\nInterview prep that knows what you've actually done. Cross-references your arsenal when coaching answers — matching question themes to evidence types (lessons for failure questions, decisions for tradeoff questions, expertise for depth questions). Spaced repetition targets weak areas over time.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/what-did-you-do:setup` | Set follow-up depth, default stage, trusted question sources |\n| `/what-did-you-do:practice` | Drill a single question with persona-driven feedback |\n| `/what-did-you-do:mock` | Full interview round simulation (Amazon, Google, Meta, custom) |\n| `/what-did-you-do:review` | Readiness assessment with trends, gaps, and anti-pattern tracking |\n| `/what-did-you-do:prep-for` | Company-specific prep plan with value mapping and timeline |\n| `/what-did-you-do:update-questions` | Add questions from trusted sources or manual entry |\n\n7 interviewer personas. 45 built-in questions. 5 scoring dimensions. Company profiles for Amazon (14 LPs), Google, and Meta.\n\n---\n\n### mark-my-words\n\nWrite, edit, and publish blog posts on Quartz static sites. Supports voice profiles (teach it how you write), Mermaid diagrams, images, and video embeds. The `from-things` skill finds high-potential evidence logs via the JSON index and transforms them into first-person stories.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/mark-my-words:setup` | Configure blog source, content directory, media, git workflow |\n| `/mark-my-words:new-post` | Write a new post via guided interview |\n| `/mark-my-words:update-post` | Edit sections, append, rewrite, or update metadata |\n| `/mark-my-words:manage-post` | List posts, manage drafts, organize tags |\n| `/mark-my-words:from-things` | Turn evidence logs into blog posts |\n| `/mark-my-words:create-voice` | Build a voice profile from writing samples |\n| `/mark-my-words:update-voice` | Refine a voice profile |\n| `/mark-my-words:add-media` | Add images, diagrams, video embeds to a post |\n\n---\n\n### what-do-you-know\n\nKnowledge reinforcement that draws from your actual experience. Explore topics with probing dialogue grounded in your arsenal, quiz yourself with dynamically generated questions referencing your real projects, identify knowledge gaps by cross-referencing skills against evidence, and build personalized learning plans that bridge from what you know to what you need.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/what-do-you-know:setup` | Set learning depth, session length, default persona, focus areas |\n| `/what-do-you-know:explore` | Topic-driven deep dive with persona-driven probing and concept mapping |\n| `/what-do-you-know:quiz` | Dynamic concept questions from your index.json with spaced repetition |\n| `/what-do-you-know:gaps` | Knowledge gap analysis across building and aspirational skills |\n| `/what-do-you-know:bridge` | Personalized learning plan from existing knowledge to gap topics |\n\n5 learning dimensions: Depth, Accuracy, Connections, Application, Articulation. Same 7 personas shared with what-did-you-do. Questions generated dynamically — no static question bank.\n\n---\n\n### screenshotr\n\nPrecise screenshot capabilities for macOS — capture screens, windows, regions, or URLs with resize, crop, delay, and format control. Built on macOS-native `screencapture` and `sips`.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `/screenshotr:setup` | Configure output directory, format, naming preferences |\n| `/screenshotr:capture` | Full-control screenshot (fullscreen, window, region, URL, display) |\n| `/screenshotr:list-windows` | List open windows with app names and IDs |\n",
        "plugins/i-did-a-thing/README.md": "# i-did-a-thing\n\nLog professional experiences — accomplishments, lessons, expertise, decisions, influence, and insights — and build tailored resumes from your evidence arsenal.\n\nNot everything worth remembering is a win. A hard lesson, deep expertise on a topic, a tough call you can articulate, influence you exercised without authority, or a pattern you noticed — all of these are interview gold and career evidence. The plugin captures each type through a guided deep-dive tailored to what kind of thing it is, then stores it as a structured, searchable log. The plugin automatically maintains skill-level arsenal summaries, pre-written resume bullets, interview talking points, and blog seeds from every entry. Log once, reuse everywhere.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add i-did-a-thing\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nConfigure your .things directory (project-local or global), git remote, professional profile (current role, target roles, skills you're building), and preferences. This creates the shared shared config used by i-did-a-thing, what-did-you-do, and mark-my-words.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\n**Migrating from v2.x?** Run `/i-did-a-thing:migrate-things` to move from per-plugin configs to the centralized shared config.\n\n## Skills\n\n**Log a Thing** — Capture a professional experience with context-aware speed. If you paste a rich transcript, decision summary, or detailed description — or if the conversation already has relevant context — the skill extracts log fields automatically, shows you a summary, and confirms before writing. Only asks about genuinely missing details. For sparse context, it falls back to a full guided deep-dive that adapts based on what kind of thing it is: accomplishments get Context-Action-Result questions, lessons explore what went wrong and what you took from it, expertise entries dig into depth and teaching, decisions walk through options and tradeoffs, influence entries cover advocacy and outcomes, and insights explore observations and theses. Classifies by impact level and category, auto-generates tags, and writes a structured log with resume bullets, interview talking points, and a blog seed. Use `--interview` to force the full interview even when context is available.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:thing-i-did [description, pasted context, or --interview]\n```\n\n**Build Resume** — Analyze a job listing (URL or pasted text), match it against your logged evidence, and produce a tailored resume. Weights evidence types by what the listing emphasizes — technical depth surfaces expertise entries, learning agility surfaces lessons, sound judgment surfaces decisions. Shows you strong matches, partial matches, and gaps. Pulls resume bullets directly from your logs in their type-appropriate format. Optionally generates cover letter talking points and a gap action plan that suggests specific evidence types to log.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:construct-resume [job listing URL or text]\n```\n\n**Migrate** — Move from per-plugin configs to the centralized shared config. Run this after updating to v3.0.0.\n\n```\n/i-did-a-thing:migrate-things [--dry-run]\n```\n\n## Evidence Types\n\n| Type | What it captures |\n|------|-----------------|\n| `accomplishment` | You did something with a measurable outcome |\n| `lesson` | Something didn't go as planned, but you extracted value |\n| `expertise` | You went deep on a topic and became a resource |\n| `decision` | You evaluated options, made a judgment call, and can articulate why |\n| `influence` | You shaped someone else's decision, advocated for a change, or mentored someone |\n| `insight` | You noticed a pattern, formed a thesis, developed a perspective |\n\n## How It Works\n\nEach entry is logged via a guided deep-dive whose questions adapt to the evidence type. Logs are stored as markdown files with rich frontmatter in your `.things` directory.\n\nThe plugin automatically maintains:\n\n- **Arsenal files** — skill-level summaries with evidence from your logs, tagged by evidence type, fully regenerated on every log write\n- **A JSON index** — `index.json` with all entry data inline (frontmatter, resume bullets, body sections, talking points, blog seeds)\n- **A tag index** — `tags.json` with tag counts and last-used dates\n- **Resume bullets** — pre-written bullets generated with each log entry in the type-appropriate format\n\nLogs include a Blog Seed section for use with `/mark-my-words:from-things`, and the celebration step points you to `/what-did-you-do:practice` for interview rehearsal.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n<things_path>/\n├── config.yml      # Shared config for all career plugins\n├── logs/           # Individual log entries\n├── arsenal/        # Synthesized skill summaries (auto-regenerated)\n├── voices/         # Voice profiles for blog writing\n├── personas/       # Shared coaching personas\n├── companies/      # Shared company profiles\n├── index.json      # Auto-generated JSON index of all logs\n└── tags.json       # Auto-generated tag counts\n```\n\nA PostToolUse hook automatically regenerates `index.json`, `tags.json`, and all arsenal files after every new log.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in a centralized config shared by all career plugins:\n\n- **Bootstrap**: `~/.claude/things.local.md` (machine-local, contains `things_path`)\n- **Full config**: `<things_path>/config.yml` (git-tracked, all settings)\n\nRun `/i-did-a-thing:setup` to reconfigure.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **what-did-you-do** — Practice interview questions coached by your arsenal, with evidence-type-aware feedback\n- **what-do-you-know** — Deepen your understanding through concept quizzing, gap analysis, and learning plans\n- **mark-my-words** — Turn your logs into blog posts with `/mark-my-words:from-things`\n",
        "plugins/what-did-you-do/README.md": "# what-did-you-do\n\nInterview preparation with persona-driven practice, company-specific mock interviews, spaced repetition question selection, and progress tracking — powered by your i-did-a-thing arsenal.\n\nDifferent from generic interview prep because it knows what you've actually done. When you answer a question, it cross-references your logged accomplishments, points out evidence you forgot to mention, flags metrics you could have cited, and identifies skills you demonstrated but didn't articulate. Over time, spaced repetition targets your weakest areas and tracks improvement across scoring dimensions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add what-did-you-do\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nLink to your shared shared config, set follow-up depth (concise, detailed, or coaching), default interview stage, and trusted sources for question bank updates.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\nRequires i-did-a-thing to be set up first (`/i-did-a-thing:setup`).\n\n## Skills\n\n**Practice** — Drill a single question with a selected interviewer persona. Questions are chosen via spaced repetition — weighted toward your weak areas, filtered to avoid recent repeats, and boosted for aspirational skills. Feedback scores five dimensions and references your arsenal.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:practice [behavioral|technical|leadership|situational|system-design]\n```\n\n**Mock Interview** — Simulate a full interview round. Multiple timed questions from a consistent persona with no feedback between questions — just like the real thing. Comprehensive debrief at the end with per-question scores, company value alignment, and action items. Supports Amazon, Google, Meta, and custom company profiles.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:mock [amazon|google|meta] [--stage phone-screen|onsite|bar-raiser]\n```\n\n**Review Readiness** — Analyze all your sessions to produce a readiness assessment. Dimension trends (improving, stable, declining), category breakdowns, persistent anti-pattern tracking, skill coverage gaps, and company-specific calibration against level expectations.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:review [--company amazon|google|meta] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]\n```\n\n**Prep For** — Build a preparation plan for a specific company. Maps your arsenal to their values, walks through each interview stage with persona and format details, predicts likely questions, and generates a practice timeline scaled to when your interview is.\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:prep-for <company> [--role <target role>] [--level <level>]\n```\n\n**Update Questions** — Add questions from trusted external sources or manual entry. Validates against your trusted domains, deduplicates against existing questions, and auto-generates metadata (skills tested, difficulty, follow-ups, red/green flags).\n\n```\n/what-did-you-do:update-questions <url or 'manual'>\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Personas\n\nSeven interviewer personas shape how questions are asked and feedback is delivered. Personas are shared with what-do-you-know and stored at `<things_path>/personas/`. Each persona has distinct evaluation weights, follow-up patterns, and anti-pattern detection:\n\n- **Staff Engineer** — technical depth, tradeoffs, system thinking\n- **Engineering Manager** — collaboration, communication, growth\n- **Principal Engineer** — multi-year strategy, organizational impact\n- **VP of Engineering** — business alignment, strategic leadership\n- **CTO** — technical vision, competitive strategy\n- **Recruiter** — motivation, culture fit, communication clarity\n- **Bar Raiser** — judgment, ownership, consistency across angles\n\n### Question Bank\n\n45 built-in questions across five categories (behavioral, technical, system-design, leadership, situational) with rich metadata: skills tested, difficulty, follow-ups at multiple depths, red/green flags, time budgets, and level/stage filtering.\n\nQuestions are selected using spaced repetition — weighted toward your weak areas, filtered to avoid recent repeats, and boosted for aspirational skills.\n\n### Company Profiles\n\nBuilt-in profiles for Amazon (14 Leadership Principles), Google, and Meta are shared across plugins and stored at `<things_path>/companies/`. Each defines company values with interview signals and anti-patterns, full interview process with stage-by-stage format and persona mappings, and level expectations. Custom company profiles are supported — add them to the same directory.\n\n### Scoring\n\nEvery answer is scored on five dimensions:\n\n- **Specificity** — concrete details vs vague claims\n- **Structure** — clear narrative arc (STAR/CAR format)\n- **Impact** — quantified outcomes and scope\n- **Relevance** — actually answers the question asked\n- **Self-Advocacy** — owns contribution without hogging credit\n\n### Session Logging\n\nEach session is saved as an individual file with full frontmatter: per-dimension scores, anti-patterns detected with examples, arsenal cross-references, unlogged accomplishment hints, and comparison to previous attempts.\n\n### Progress Tracking\n\nA rolling readiness dashboard tracks dimension averages, trends, category breakdowns, and persistent anti-patterns across all sessions.\n\n## Session Data\n\nStored alongside your i-did-a-thing data:\n\n```\n<things_path>/interview-prep/\n├── sessions/           # One file per practice or mock session\n├── progress.md         # Rolling readiness dashboard\n└── question-overrides/ # Custom questions\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in the centralized shared config shared by all career plugins:\n\n- **Bootstrap**: `~/.claude/things.local.md` (machine-local, contains `things_path`)\n- **Full config**: `<things_path>/config.yml` (git-tracked, `interview_prep:` section)\n\nRun `/what-did-you-do:setup` to reconfigure interview preferences.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **i-did-a-thing** — Log the accomplishments that power your interview feedback\n- **what-do-you-know** — Deepen your understanding through concept quizzing and learning plans, using the same personas\n- **mark-my-words** — Turn your accomplishments into blog posts\n",
        "plugins/mark-my-words/README.md": "# mark-my-words\n\nWrite, manage, and publish blog posts on any markdown-based platform — Quartz, Hugo, Jekyll, Astro, Eleventy, Docusaurus, and Zola.\n\nHandles the full lifecycle — drafting new posts, editing existing ones, managing tags and draft status, and publishing. Works with both local directories and remote git repos. Each platform gets native support for its frontmatter format, content features, and conventions. If you use i-did-a-thing, the `from-things` skill can turn your evidence logs into blog posts, pulling in the narrative structure, metrics, and reflection you've already captured.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add mark-my-words\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nConfigure your blog platform, source location (local path or git remote), content directory, default tags, and git workflow preferences. Updates the shared config.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:setup\n```\n\nRequires i-did-a-thing to be set up first (`/i-did-a-thing:setup`).\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\n| Platform | Frontmatter | Callouts | Mermaid | Key Feature |\n|----------|-------------|----------|---------|-------------|\n| **Quartz** | YAML | `> [!type]` | Native | Obsidian-compatible wikilinks |\n| **Hugo** | YAML | — | Theme-dependent | Figure shortcodes, ref links |\n| **Jekyll** | YAML | — | Plugin-dependent | Date-prefixed filenames, `_drafts/` |\n| **Astro** | YAML | — | Plugin-dependent | Content collections, `pubDate` |\n| **Eleventy** | YAML | — | Plugin-dependent | Flexible structure, tag collections |\n| **Docusaurus** | YAML | `:::type` | Official plugin | MDX, rich author metadata |\n| **Zola** | TOML `+++` | — | Theme-dependent | Taxonomies, page bundles |\n\n## Skills\n\n**New Post** — Write a new blog post. Walks you through title, length, key points, tags, and draft status, then generates a platform-compatible post with proper frontmatter and structure.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:new-post [topic or idea]\n```\n\n**Update Post** — Edit an existing post. Supports targeted section edits, appending content, full rewrites, and metadata-only changes. Preserves your original voice for partial edits.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:update-post [filename or search term]\n```\n\n**Manage Posts** — List all posts with metadata, view and publish drafts, and organize tags across your blog (add, remove, rename tags in bulk).\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:manage-post [list, drafts, publish, tags]\n```\n\n**Create Voice** — Build a voice profile from your writing samples. Analyzes your tone, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and habits to create a compact style guide that makes posts sound like you.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:create-voice [voice name]\n```\n\n**Update Voice** — Refine an existing voice profile with new samples, manual edits, or a full regeneration.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:update-voice [voice name]\n```\n\n**From Things** — Transform i-did-a-thing evidence logs into blog posts. Finds candidates via the JSON index by blog potential, pulls in the Blog Seed hook, narrative structure, and metrics. You choose the angle — tutorial, retrospective, or one of the angles suggested in the log itself.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:from-things [log filename or search query]\n```\n\n**Add Media** — Add images, diagrams, and video embeds to an existing post. Analyzes your post for visual opportunities and walks you through each one — generate diagrams, provide your own images, search the web, or embed videos.\n\n```\n/mark-my-words:add-media [post filename or search term]\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nPosts are written in your platform's native markdown format with full frontmatter. Each platform has a dedicated template (`platforms/<name>.md`) that defines its frontmatter fields, content syntax (callouts, code blocks, image format), and conventions. The plugin loads the right template based on your config and follows it throughout.\n\nThe plugin handles git workflows (auto, ask, or manual) based on your configuration. Rich media — Mermaid diagrams, images, GIFs, and video embeds — can be added during writing or to existing posts, using your platform's native syntax.\n\nThe `from-things` skill bridges your i-did-a-thing evidence logs into narrative blog posts — it uses the JSON index to find high-potential entries, then transforms structured log data into an engaging first-person story.\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in the centralized shared config shared by all career plugins:\n\n- **Bootstrap**: `~/.claude/things.local.md` (machine-local, contains `things_path`)\n- **Full config**: `<things_path>/config.yml` (git-tracked, `blog:` section)\n\nThe `blog:` section includes a `platform:` field that determines which platform template to use. Run `/mark-my-words:setup` to reconfigure blog settings.\n\n### Voice Profiles\n\nVoice profiles live at `<things_path>/voices/<name>.md` and teach mark-my-words how you write. They're stored in the things repo for cross-machine sync. Create profiles from your existing writing samples, then set a default voice so all new posts match your style. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them when creating posts.\n\n### Media Support\n\nConfigure a `media_dir` in setup to enable image management. When set, the writing and editing skills can add diagrams, download and reference images, and embed videos. Auto-suggest mode detects visual opportunities as you write. AI image generation is available as an opt-in when MCP tools are present.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **i-did-a-thing** — Log professional experiences that feed into blog posts via `from-things`\n- **what-did-you-do** — Practice talking about your work in interviews\n",
        "plugins/what-do-you-know/README.md": "# what-do-you-know\n\nDeepen your understanding of topics through concept quizzing, knowledge gap analysis, and personalized learning plans — powered by your i-did-a-thing arsenal.\n\nDifferent from generic learning tools because it knows what you've actually done. When you explore a topic, it grounds the conversation in your logged projects. When you quiz yourself, questions reference your real architecture decisions, not textbook scenarios. When it finds gaps, they're measured against your career goals and compared to evidence you've actually produced.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin:add what-do-you-know\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nLink to your shared shared config, set learning depth, default persona, session length, and focus areas.\n\n```\n/what-do-you-know:setup [reconfigure]\n```\n\nRequires i-did-a-thing to be set up first (`/i-did-a-thing:setup`).\n\n## Skills\n\n**Explore** — Topic-driven deep dive with a persona probing your understanding. Grounded in your arsenal — questions reference your actual projects, decisions, and lessons. Produces a concept map showing what's strong, partial, and missing.\n\n```\n/what-do-you-know:explore <topic> [--persona staff-engineer|...] [--depth exploratory|focused|deep]\n```\n\n**Quiz** — Concept-based spaced repetition with dynamically generated questions. No static question bank — every question is created from your index.json, referencing your real projects and experiences. Tracks scores over time for spaced repetition scheduling.\n\n```\n/what-do-you-know:quiz [--topic <topic>] [--persona staff-engineer|...] [--count 3|5|10]\n```\n\n**Gaps** — Knowledge gap analysis that cross-references your building and aspirational skills against arsenal evidence depth, evidence type diversity, learning session scores, and evidence recency. Classifies each area as Strong, Building, Gap, or Blind Spot.\n\n```\n/what-do-you-know:gaps [--focus building|aspirational|all]\n```\n\n**Bridge** — Personalized learning plan builder. Finds your closest existing knowledge and builds a path from there to the gap topic, with exercises tied to your actual projects and checkpoints using explore and quiz sessions.\n\n```\n/what-do-you-know:bridge <gap-topic> [--from <existing-strength>] [--timeline 1-week|2-weeks|1-month]\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Personas\n\nSeven coaching personas shape the probing dialogue and feedback delivery. Shared with what-did-you-do and stored at `<things_path>/personas/`. Each persona has distinct evaluation weights and follow-up patterns adapted for learning (not interview coaching):\n\n- **Staff Engineer** — technical depth, architecture, tradeoffs\n- **Engineering Manager** — collaboration, communication, growth\n- **Principal Engineer** — multi-year strategy, organizational impact\n- **VP of Engineering** — business alignment, strategic leadership\n- **CTO** — technical vision, competitive strategy\n- **Recruiter** — communication clarity, motivation\n- **Bar Raiser** — judgment, ownership, consistency\n\n### Dynamic Questions\n\nNo static question bank. Questions are generated from your `index.json` on every session, referencing your actual:\n- Architecture decisions and their tradeoffs\n- Technologies you've used and their internals\n- Projects you've built and their failure modes\n- Patterns you've observed across experiences\n\n### Scoring\n\nEvery answer is scored on five learning dimensions:\n\n- **Depth** — how far below the surface can you explain? Internals vs. buzzwords\n- **Accuracy** — are your mental models technically correct?\n- **Connections** — can you relate this to adjacent concepts and your own experiences?\n- **Application** — can you apply the knowledge to new situations?\n- **Articulation** — can you explain it clearly to someone else?\n\n### Knowledge Map\n\nA living document at `<things_path>/learning/knowledge-map.md` that classifies your knowledge into:\n- **Strong** — consistent depth, accuracy, ability to teach\n- **Building** — partial understanding, some depth but gaps remain\n- **Gap** — limited knowledge despite relevance to goals\n- **Blind Spot** — relevant to target roles but unexplored\n\n### Session Logging\n\nEach session is saved with full frontmatter: per-dimension scores, concept classifications, arsenal cross-references, and recommendations for next steps.\n\n### Progress Tracking\n\nA rolling progress dashboard tracks dimension averages, trends, topic breakdowns, and concept strength across all sessions.\n\n## Session Data\n\nStored alongside your i-did-a-thing data:\n\n```\n<things_path>/learning/\n├── sessions/        # One file per explore or quiz session\n├── progress.md      # Rolling learning progress dashboard\n├── knowledge-map.md # Living knowledge area classifications\n└── study-plans/     # Bridge learning plans\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in the centralized shared config shared by all career plugins:\n\n- **Bootstrap**: `~/.claude/things.local.md` (machine-local, contains `things_path`)\n- **Full config**: `<things_path>/config.yml` (git-tracked, `learning:` section)\n\nRun `/what-do-you-know:setup` to reconfigure learning preferences.\n\n## Related Plugins\n\n- **i-did-a-thing** — Log the experiences that power your learning sessions\n- **what-did-you-do** — Practice interview questions with the same personas and arsenal\n- **mark-my-words** — Turn your learning insights into blog posts\n",
