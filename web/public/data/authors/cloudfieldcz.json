        "README.md": "# CF Powers\n\nSkills plugin for Claude Code that guides your AI coding agent through a structured development workflow — from idea to implementation.\n\nBased on [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent, extended with technical analysis workflow and cross-check review agents.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Register the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add cloudfieldcz/cf-powers\n\n# 2. Install the plugin\n/plugin install cf-powers@cf-powers\n\n# 3. Verify — you should see cf-powers commands in the list\n/help\n```\n\nThat's it. The plugin activates automatically on every session.\n\n## Workflow\n\nEvery feature starts the same way:\n\n```\n/brainstorm  →  /write-analysis  →  /write-plan  →  execute\n                     ↓\n              BA + Dev cross-check\n```\n\n1. **`/brainstorm`** — Refine your idea through questions. Produces a design document.\n2. **`/write-analysis`** — Turn the design into a full technical analysis (Czech output): architecture, DB changes, affected files, phases, risks, testing. Automatically dispatches BA and Developer reviewers for cross-check.\n3. **`/write-plan`** — Break the analysis into bite-sized TDD implementation tasks.\n4. **Execute** — Run the plan via subagent-driven development or batch execution.\n\nWhat happens at step 3 depends on the size of the feature:\n\n### Simple Feature (single phase)\n\nWhen the analysis contains one logical phase, `/write-plan` produces a single plan file:\n\n```\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan.md\n```\n\nYou execute it in one go — either with **subagent-driven development** (in the current session) or by opening a new session with **executing-plans** (batch execution with checkpoints).\n\n### Multi-Phase Feature\n\nWhen the analysis defines multiple implementation phases, `/write-plan` produces one plan file per phase plus an index:\n\n```\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan-index.md      ← orchestration dashboard\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan-1-models.md    ← phase 1\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan-2-services.md  ← phase 2\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-plan-3-ui.md        ← phase 3\n```\n\nYou then execute phases one at a time (or in parallel if they have no dependencies). The index file tracks overall progress. After each phase completes, Claude updates the index and asks which phase to tackle next.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | When it activates |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| **brainstorming** | Before any creative work |\n| **write-analysis** | After brainstorming, before implementation planning |\n| **review-as-ba** | Cross-check analysis from business analyst perspective |\n| **review-as-dev** | Cross-check analysis from developer perspective |\n| **writing-plans** | When you need a step-by-step implementation plan |\n| **executing-plans** | Batch execution with human checkpoints |\n| **subagent-driven-development** | Fast parallel execution with two-stage review |\n| **test-driven-development** | During implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) |\n| **systematic-debugging** | When encountering bugs or test failures |\n| **verification-before-completion** | Before claiming work is done |\n| **requesting-code-review** | After completing tasks |\n| **receiving-code-review** | When processing review feedback |\n| **dispatching-parallel-agents** | When facing independent parallel tasks |\n| **using-git-worktrees** | When you need an isolated workspace |\n| **finishing-a-development-branch** | When ready to merge or create a PR |\n| **writing-skills** | When creating new skills |\n| **using-superpowers** | Injected automatically at session start |\n\n## Updating\n\n```bash\n/plugin update cf-powers\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is a fork of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra). The original project provides the core skills library (TDD, debugging, collaboration patterns) and the plugin architecture. We added the `write-analysis` workflow with BA/Developer cross-check agents.\n\n## License\n\nMIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n"
