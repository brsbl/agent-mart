Includes SIW planning, PR lifecycle skills, verification helpers, review agents, hooks, and supporting scripts. |\n| [`kramme-connect-workflow`](kramme-connect-workflow/) | Connect-specific plugin for [Consensus ApS](https://consensus.dk)'s monorepo work (Angular modernization, Nx extraction, NgRx migration, and Rive docs). |\n\n## Main Plugin Contents (`kramme-cc-workflow`)\n\n- `48` skills in `skills/` (SIW, PR workflows, Linear workflows, verification, documentation utilities, and session helpers)\n- `20` specialized agents in `agents/` for review and analysis\n- built-in hooks in `hooks/hooks.json` for command safety, non-interactive git enforcement, formatting, and context links\n- release and install tooling in `scripts/`\n- Bats test suite in `tests/`\n\nDetailed documentation is available in [`kramme-cc-workflow/README.md`](kramme-cc-workflow/README.md).\n\n## What SIW Is\n\nSIW means **Structured Implementation Workflow**.\n\nIt is a local, file-based workflow for planning and implementing non-trivial work in a repository. Instead of relying on an external tracker, SIW keeps specification, issue breakdown, and progress state in versioned Markdown files.\n\nSIW typically manages:\n- specification files (created or linked during setup)\n- `siw/LOG.md` for decisions and progress notes\n- `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md` as the active issue index\n- `siw/issues/` for issue files with status and implementation context\n\nCommon SIW command flow:\n\n```bash\n/kramme:siw:init               # create or link spec + initialize siw/\n/kramme:siw:generate-phases    # break spec into phase-based issues\n/kramme:siw:issue-implement    # implement one issue\n/kramme:siw:implementation-audit\n/kramme:siw:issues-reindex\n```\n\nRelated SIW commands include `/kramme:siw:issue-define`, `/kramme:siw:spec-audit`, `/kramme:siw:reset`, `/kramme:siw:reverse-engineer-spec`, and `/kramme:siw:remove`.\n\n## Installation\n\nMarketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin marketplace add Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow\nclaude /plugin install kramme-cc-workflow@kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nLocal install:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin install /path/to/kramme-cc-workflow/kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nInstall the Connect plugin from marketplace:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin install kramme-cc-workflow@kramme-connect-workflow\n```\n\nLocal install for the Connect plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin install /path/to/kramme-cc-workflow/kramme-connect-workflow\n```\n\nUpdate marketplace install:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin marketplace update kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\n## Example Commands\n\nAfter installation, common entry points are:\n\n```bash\n/kramme:siw:init\n/kramme:pr:code-review\n/kramme:pr:fix-ci\n/kramme:verify:run\n```\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n| Directory | Purpose |\n|---|---|\n| [`kramme-cc-workflow/`](kramme-cc-workflow/) | Main plugin: workflow automation, review agents, hooks, and verification |\n| [`kramme-connect-workflow/`](kramme-connect-workflow/) | Connect product-specific skills |\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [`kramme-cc-workflow/README.md`](kramme-cc-workflow/README.md)\n- [`kramme-connect-workflow/README.md`](kramme-connect-workflow/README.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Developed for personal use and shared here for inspiration — adapt them to your own workflow, or use them as a starting point.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation & Updating](#installation--updating)\n- [Skills](#skills)\n  - [User-Invocable Skills](#user-invocable-skills)\n  - [Background Skills](#background-skills)\n- [Agents](#agents)\n- [Hooks](#hooks)\n- [Suggested Permissions](#suggested-permissions)\n- [Recommended MCP Servers](#recommended-mcp-servers)\n- [Recommended CLIs](#recommended-clis)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Testing](#testing)\n- [Plugin Structure](#plugin-structure)\n- [Adding Components](#adding-components)\n- [Related Plugins](#related-plugins)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Releases](#releases)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installation & Updating\n\n### Installation\n\nMarketplace install (recommended):\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin marketplace add Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow\nclaude /plugin install kramme-cc-workflow@kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nDirect Git install:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin install git+https://github.com/Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nFor local development:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin install /path/to/kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\n### OpenCode + Codex (experimental)\n\nThis repo includes a converter CLI (Node.js) that installs the plugin into OpenCode or Codex.\nRequires Node.js 18+. Use the plugin name from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (here: `kramme-cc-workflow`).\n\n```bash\n# OpenCode\nnode scripts/convert-plugin.js install kramme-cc-workflow --to opencode\n\n# Codex\nnode scripts/convert-plugin.js install kramme-cc-workflow --to codex\n```\n\nRun with npx (no clone):\n\n```bash\n# OpenCode\nnpx --yes github:Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow install kramme-cc-workflow --to opencode\n\n# Codex\nnpx --yes github:Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow install kramme-cc-workflow --to codex\n```\n\nLocal dev from this repo:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/install-opencode.sh\n./scripts/install-codex.sh\n```\n\nHelper scripts forward additional args to the converter (e.g., `--output`, `--codex-home`, `--also codex`).\n\nOpenCode output defaults to `~/.config/opencode` (XDG). Codex output defaults to `~/.codex` (`prompts/` and `skills/`).\nBoth targets are experimental and may change as the formats evolve.\n\n### Updating\n\nFor marketplace installs:\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin marketplace update kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nFor Git or local installs, re-run the install command to pull the latest version:\n\n```bash\n# Git install\nclaude /plugin install git+https://github.com/Abildtoft/kramme-cc-workflow\n\n# Local development\nclaude /plugin install /path/to/kramme-cc-workflow\n```\n\nFor OpenCode/Codex installs, updating is the same as installing: re-run the converter to regenerate the output (use the commands in the OpenCode + Codex section). This overwrites the generated files in `~/.config/opencode` or `~/.codex`.\n\nRestart Claude Code after updating for changes to take effect.\n\n**Auto-update:** Since Claude Code v2.0.70, auto-update can be enabled per-marketplace.\n\n## Skills\n\nAll plugin functionality is delivered through skills. Skills can be user-invoked via the `/` menu, auto-triggered by Claude based on context, or both.\n\n- **User-invocable**: Trigger with `/kramme:skill-name`. Skills that should never auto-run set `disable-model-invocation: true`.\n- **Auto-triggered**: Claude invokes automatically when context matches the skill description.\n- **Background**: Skills with `user-invocable: false` are auto-triggered only and don't appear in the `/` menu.\n\n### User-Invocable Skills\n\n#### Structured Implementation Workflow (SIW)\n\nLocal issue tracking and structured implementation planning using markdown files.\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Description |\n|-------|------------|-------------|\n| `/kramme:siw:init` | User | Initialize structured implementation workflow documents in `siw/` (spec, siw/LOG.md, siw/issues).
