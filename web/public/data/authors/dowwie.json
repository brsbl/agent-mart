It covers the entire pipeline:  spec -> plan -> execute.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dowwie/tasker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --easy-mode\n```\n\nThis installs the `tasker` CLI and registers the Claude Code plugin. After installation, start a new session:\n- `/tasker:specify` — develop a specification\n- `/tasker:plan` — decompose into tasks\n- `/tasker:execute` — implement and verify\n\n---\n\n## Specify → Plan → Execute\n\nTasker enforces a three-stage pipeline.\n\n**Specify** captures intent exhaustively. Edge cases, state transitions, and invariants are resolved before implementation begins.\n\n**Plan** decomposes the specification into isolated, verifiable tasks with explicit dependencies.\n\n**Execute** implements each task and verifies results against the spec.\n\nBy the time code is written, behavior is defined and implementation becomes translation.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes This Work\n\n**Exhaustive discovery.** Agents naturally stop asking after a few questions. Tasker uses reduce-while loops that continue until all requirement categories are covered. The loop pressure forces comprehensive specifications.\n\n**Steel thread first.** Before building features, validate the architecture. The primary end-to-end flow is identified and implemented early; if the foundation is flawed, you discover it in days, not months.\n\n**Task decomposition protocol.** Specifications are transformed into a directed acyclic graph through a structured six-phase process: logical decomposition, physical mapping, cross-cutting concerns, task definition, dependency analysis, and completeness audits. Every task is small enough to verify, specific enough to implement without questions.\n\n**Finite state machines as contracts.** State machines serve two purposes: shaping acceptance criteria during implementation, and producing documentation for ongoing understanding. The FSM JSON is canonical; diagrams are derived.\n\n**Decision registry.** Architectural decisions are captured in ADRs alongside specifications. Context is preserved, not lost to chat history.\n\n---\n\n## Resumable Workflow\n\nStop anytime with `tasker stop`, resume with `tasker resume`. Checkpoints are created before each batch; result files track every task outcome; git commits mark progress. Work survives interruptions.\n\n"
