        "README.md": "# Architecture Documentation Plugin\n\nThree skills for technical documentation: architecture docs with C4 diagrams, technical debrief outlines, and a human writing style toolkit.\n\n## Skills\n\n### architecture-documentation\n\nGenerates architecture documentation from codebases with system diagrams, component analysis, and engineering rationale.\n\n- C4 Model Diagrams (system context, container, component) using PlantUML/Kroki or Eraser syntax\n- Component Responsibility Matrix with dependencies, failure modes, recovery strategies\n- Configuration rationale, library choices, performance decisions with metrics\n- Decision log (ADRs) with context and consequences\n- Optional appendices: tech stack summary, API endpoint reference\n\n### technical-debrief-outline\n\nCreates structured presentation outlines for technical debriefs. Optimized for mixed audiences (engineers, PMs, executives).\n\n- Problem-solution framing with real examples\n- Mermaid diagrams for architecture sections\n- Comparison tables (v1 vs v2, POC vs production)\n- Presenter callout quotes and audience Q&A prep\n- Includes a blank template in `references/outline_template.md`\n\n### human-writing-style\n\nStrips robotic AI patterns from any written content. Produces writing that sounds like a person wrote it.\n\n- Banned word list (delve, leverage, robust, etc.)\n- Short sentence / varied rhythm techniques\n- Specificity over vagueness — numbers beat adjectives\n- Coffee shop test: if it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it\n- Works on docs, outlines, reports, changelogs, anything with words\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add dha201/architecture-documentation-plugin\n/plugin install architecture-documentation\n```\n\nThe marketplace will be registered as `dha201-plugins`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n@architecture-documentation Generate architecture documentation for this codebase\n@technical-debrief-outline Prepare a debrief for stakeholders\n@human-writing-style Rewrite this to sound human\n```\n\nOr let Claude detect when to use them based on your request.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code 1.0.33 or later\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
