        "README.md": "# Creative Strategy Skills\n\nCreative strategy superpowers for AI agents — built by [Motion](https://www.motionapp.com).\n\nInstall once, then talk to your AI agent like normal. It'll brainstorm hooks, develop ad concepts, and write UGC scripts using proven creative strategy frameworks.\n\n## What's Inside\n\n| Skill | What it does | When to use it |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **hooks-generator** | Brainstorm psychologically compelling ad hooks that stop the scroll | You need opening lines for ads that create instant audience recognition |\n| **ad-concept-generator** | Develop hooks into strategic ad concepts for paid social | You have a hook and need to build it into a full creative brief |\n| **ugc-scriptwriter** | Draft authentic UGC-style scripts for creator content | You need a script a creator can actually film |\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOpen your terminal (wherever you use skills) and paste this:\n\n```\nnpx skills add motion-creative/skills\n```\n\nThat's it. The skills are now available in every conversation. No configuration needed.\n\n**Not sure if it worked?** Ask the agent: *\"What Motion skills do I have installed?\"*\n\n## How to Use\n\nNo special commands. No syntax to memorize. The skills activate automatically when your request matches what they do — just talk to the agent like you normally would.\n\nHere are some prompts to try:\n\n**Generate hooks:**\n\n> \"Help me brainstorm hooks for my fitness app targeting women 25-35 who hate the gym\"\n\n**Build an ad concept:**\n\n> \"Take this hook and turn it into a full ad concept: 'You've reread that same paragraph 4 times'\"\n\n**Write a UGC script:**\n\n> \"Write a 30-second UGC script for noise-canceling headphones, casual tone, for TikTok\"\n\n### Chaining Skills Together\n\nThe skills work best as a pipeline. Start broad, then get specific:\n\n1. **Start with hooks** — brainstorm 10-20 raw hook ideas for your product\n2. **Pick your best hook** → ask the agent to develop it into a full ad concept with audience, format, and messaging\n3. **Take the concept** → ask the agent to write it as a UGC script ready for production\n\nYou can do this in a single conversation. Keep building on what the agent gives you.\n\n## What Makes These Different\n\nThese aren't generic AI prompts. Each skill is built on real creative strategy frameworks that top-performing brands use every day.\n\n**Jump right in** — describe your product and get output immediately. No setup, no discovery questions, no friction.\n\n**Go deeper when you want to** — answer a few targeted questions about your audience, positioning, and goals for sharper, more specific results.\n\n**Learn the craft** — each skill explains *why* certain approaches work, so you get better at creative strategy over time — not just better at prompting.\n\n## Want to Scale This?\n\nThese skills are great for ideation and one-off projects. When you're ready to analyze what's actually working across thousands of ads and generate concepts based on real performance data, that's what [Motion](https://www.motionapp.com) is built for.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n---\n\nBuilt by [Motion](https://www.motionapp.com) — Creative Analytics for Paid Social\n"
