        "README.md": "# aliok's Claude Code Plugins\n\nA collection of custom Claude Code plugins to enhance development workflows.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### plan-execute\n\nA two-command workflow for systematic planning and execution of implementation tasks.\n\n**Commands:**\n- `/plan [task description]` - Analyze task and create a structured, reviewable plan\n- `/execute-plan` - Execute the plan systematically with progress tracking\n\n**Features:**\n- Separates planning from execution\n- Creates reviewable plans you can edit before execution\n- Systematic step-by-step execution\n- Real-time progress tracking via TodoWrite\n- Resumable if interrupted\n- No skipped steps - ensures thorough implementation\n\n**Use Case:**\nWhen you have a complex implementation task and want to:\n1. See the full plan before any code is written\n2. Review and potentially modify the approach\n3. Execute systematically with clear progress tracking\n4. Ensure nothing is forgotten or skipped\n\n### work-tracking\n\nMaintain work continuity across sessions by logging work status and resuming from where you left off.\n\n**Commands:**\n- `/work-log` - Capture current work status (what works, what doesn't, next steps)\n- `/work-continue` - Resume from last logged work session\n\n**Features:**\n- Centralized work logs stored in `~/.claude-work-tracking/`\n- Tracks work across all projects in one place\n- Analyzes git status, commits, and file changes\n- Stores what's working, what's incomplete, and suggested next steps\n- Resume work seamlessly across different sessions\n\n**Use Case:**\nWhen you're working on a feature (especially with `/plan-execute`) and need to stop mid-work:\n1. Run `/work-log` to capture current status\n2. Later, run `/work-continue` to see where you left off and resume\n3. Works across all projects - never lose track of what you were doing\n\n## Installation\n\n### Add the Marketplace\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add aliok/aliok-claude-plugins\n```\n\n### Install Specific Plugin\n\n```bash\n/plugin install plan-execute@aliok-claude-plugins\n/plugin install work-tracking@aliok-claude-plugins\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### plan-execute Plugin\n\n```bash\n# Create a plan\n/plan add user authentication with JWT\n\n# Claude explores your codebase and creates .claude/plans/plan.md\n# Review the plan, edit if needed\n\n# Execute when ready\n/execute-plan\n\n# Claude systematically implements each step with TodoWrite tracking\n```\n\n### work-tracking Plugin\n\n```bash\n# While working on a feature, need to stop\n/work-log\n\n# Claude analyzes git status, commits, and changes\n# Saves: what works, what doesn't work yet, next steps\n\n# Later (same project or different project)\n/work-continue\n\n# Claude shows where you left off and asks if you want to continue\n```\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\n```\naliok-claude-plugins/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json          # Marketplace catalog\n├── plugins/\n│   └── plan-execute/\n│       ├── .claude-plugin/\n│       │   └── plugin.json       # Plugin manifest\n│       └── commands/\n│           ├── plan.md           # /plan command\n│           └── execute-plan.md   # /execute-plan command\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Development\n\nSee [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on creating and testing plugins.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to suggest improvements or report issues!\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
