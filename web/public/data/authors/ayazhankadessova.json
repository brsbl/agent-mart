        "README.md": "# essential-skills\n\nA plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that adds 11 slash-command skills for everyday development workflows — commit messages, code review, planning, debugging, documentation, and more.\n\n## Why?\n\nClaude Code is powerful out of the box, but it doesn't enforce consistent patterns for things like commit messages, code reviews, or branch naming. These skills give it opinionated, repeatable workflows so you get reliable results every time instead of one-off responses.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin add ayazhankadessova/essential-skills\n```\n\n## Skills\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---|---|\n| `/commit-msg` | Write structured commit messages with conventional tags and per-file summaries |\n| `/review-standard` | Three-phase code review: docs completeness, code quality, and advanced analysis |\n| `/plan-guideline` | Build implementation plans with file-level detail and a docs-then-tests-then-code workflow |\n| `/debug-report` | Trace failing tests to root cause, add instrumentation, escalate when stuck |\n| `/document-guideline` | Standards for design docs, folder READMEs, interface docs, and test documentation |\n| `/doc-architect` | Scan a feature and produce a documentation impact checklist |\n| `/open-issue` | Draft and create GitHub issues with structured formatting and tags |\n| `/open-pr` | Draft and create GitHub pull requests with structured formatting and tags |\n| `/fork-dev-branch` | Create a dev branch tied to a GitHub issue with consistent naming |\n| `/move-a-file` | Move/rename a file and update every reference across the codebase |\n| `/shell-script-review` | Review shell scripts for correct behavior in both Bash and Zsh |\n\n## Credits\n\nSeveral skills were originally derived from [agentize](https://github.com/Synthesys-Lab/agentize) by Synthesys-Lab and have been customized for this plugin.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
