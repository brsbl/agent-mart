        "README.md": "# Dream Team\n\nA Claude Code plugin for planning and executing development projects across three execution modes.\n\n## Overview\n\nDream Team provides structured planning skills that generate spec files, and a universal build skill that reads the\nspec and executes it using the appropriate strategy. It ships with seven specialized agents for common development roles.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nFor all features to work — especially the **Team** execution mode — you need to enable experimental agent teams in Claude Code:\n\n```\nexport CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1\n```\n\nSee the [Agent Teams documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) for details.\n\nA terminal multiplexer like **tmux** or **iTerm2** is recommended, as agent teams spawn multiple Claude instances that benefit\nfrom separate panes/windows for monitoring.\n\n### Optional: Playwright MCP\n\nIf your specs set `playwright: true`, builder and tester agents will use Playwright to verify UI changes visually\n(navigate pages, take screenshots, interact with elements, check for console errors). Install the\n[Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) to enable this:\n\n```\nclaude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest\n```\n\nWithout it, agents will skip visual verification and note it in their reports.\n\n## Installation\n\nRegister the repository as a local marketplace, then install:\n\n```\nclaude plugin marketplace add Ratler/dream-team-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dream-team@dream-team-marketplace\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Brainstorm your idea:\n\n   ```\n   /dream-team:plan Build a REST API for user management\n   ```\n\n2. Write the spec (after brainstorming completes):\n\n   ```\n   /dream-team:spec-delegated\n   ```\n\n3. Execute:\n\n   ```\n   /dream-team:build specs/2026-02-08-user-management.md\n   ```\n\n## Features At a Glance\n\n| Area                | Dream Team                                                |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Philosophy**      | Turn Claude into a project lead                           |\n| **Skills**          | 6 pipeline-connected skills (plan, spec x3, build, debug) |\n| **Agents**          | 7 named roles with per-agent model and tool policies      |\n| **Execution modes** | Sequential, Delegated, Team                               |\n| **Planning**        | Formal specs with YAML frontmatter                        |\n| **Task tracking**   | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate with dependency graph               |\n| **Git workflow**    | Built into execution (branch, commit, review gates)       |\n| **Code review**     | Configurable review policy with retry loops               |\n| **Team support**    | Parallel Claude instances via experimental agent teams    |\n| **Playwright**      | First-class integration (opt-in per spec)                 |\n| **Validation**      | Hook-enforced (preflight checks, can't skip)              |\n\n\n## How It Works\n\nDream Team separates the workflow into three distinct phases: brainstorm, spec, build. Each phase has its own command\nand produces a clear handoff to the next.\n\n### 1. Plan (brainstorm)\n\n`/dream-team:plan` starts an interactive conversation. It explores the codebase, asks clarifying questions one at\na time, proposes 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, and walks through the task breakdown section by section. No files are\ncreated; the output is a shared understanding between you and Claude. At the end, it recommends which execution mode\nfits best.\n\n### 2. Spec (write)\n\nOnce brainstorming is complete, run the spec command for your chosen execution mode. The command you pick determines\nhow the build phase will run:\n\n- `/dream-team:spec-sequential` — produces a spec for single-session execution\n- `/dream-team:spec-delegated` — produces a spec with agent assignments for orchestrated execution\n- `/dream-team:spec-team` — produces a spec with team configuration for parallel Claude instances\n\nThe spec skill picks up the conversation context, reads the shared template (`templates/spec-template.md`), and writes\na structured spec file to `specs/`. The spec includes YAML frontmatter declaring the execution mode, along with sections\nfor tasks, acceptance criteria, and depending on the mode, agent assignments or team configuration. Tasks use\ndependencies so blocked work waits for its prerequisites automatically.\n\n### 3. Build (execute)\n\n`/dream-team:build specs/<filename>.md` reads the spec's `mode` frontmatter and runs the matching execution strategy:\n\n- **Sequential** -- Iterates through tasks in dependency order within a single session. No sub-agents are spawned. The\n  main session handles everything directly, making it the simplest and cheapest path.\n- **Delegated** -- An orchestrator in the main session dispatches tasks to specialized sub-agents (builder, researcher,\n  reviewer, etc.) using the Task tool. The orchestrator tracks progress and routes results between agents. Sub-agents\n  run within the same session but get fresh context for each task.\n- **Team** -- Launches separate Claude instances as a full agent team. Each instance picks up tasks from a shared task\n  list and communicates through it. This enables true parallelism across independent workstreams but requires the\n  `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable.\n\n### Debug (standalone)\n\n`/dream-team:debug` is a standalone debugging skill that works independently of the plan/spec/build workflow. It\nreproduces the issue, investigates root cause, applies a targeted fix, and verifies the resolution.\n\n### Hooks\n\nFour JavaScript hooks run at key points in the workflow:\n\n- **SessionStart** -- Injects plugin context (available agents, spec template location, slash commands) into every new\n  session so Claude knows Dream Team is available.\n- **Spec exists** (Stop hook) -- After a spec skill finishes, validates that a spec file was actually written to\n  `specs/`. _Currently dormant — see [Known Issues](#known-issues)._\n- **Spec sections** (Stop hook) -- Validates that the spec contains all required sections for its declared execution\n  mode. _Currently dormant — see [Known Issues](#known-issues)._\n- **Build complete** (Stop hook) -- After a build skill finishes, checks that all tasks reached the `completed` state.\n  _Currently dormant — see [Known Issues](#known-issues)._\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **Stop hooks in skill frontmatter do not fire** ([anthropics/claude-code#19225](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19225)).\n  The three validation hooks (spec exists, spec sections, build complete) are wired correctly in skill frontmatter but\n  Claude Code never invokes them. The SessionStart hook in `hooks.json` works fine. The Stop hooks will activate once\n  the upstream bug is fixed, no changes needed on our side.\n\n## Agents\n\n| Agent      | Model  | Role                                                      |\n|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| builder    | opus   | Writes code, runs tests, commits                          |\n| researcher | sonnet | Explores codebases and gathers context (read-only)        |\n| architect  | opus   | Designs systems and makes technical decisions (read-only) |\n| reviewer   | sonnet | Reviews code for correctness and quality (read-only)      |\n| tester     | sonnet | Writes and runs tests                                     |\n| validator  | haiku  | Fast validation checks (read-only)                        |\n| debugger   | opus   | Systematic debugging: reproduce, investigate, fix         |\n\n\n## Tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nnode tests/test_session_start.js\nnode tests/test_validate_spec_exists.js\nnode tests/test_validate_spec_sections.js\nnode tests/test_validate_build_complete.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
