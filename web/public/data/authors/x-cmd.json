        "README.md": "# x-cmd/skill: AI Agent Skills Collection\n\nThis repository contains a curated collection of skills for AI agents. While originally developed for Claude Code, these skills work with various AI agents to help them handle tasks more effectively.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nThis repository is built with a focus on quality and collaboration:\n\n- **Human-Curated Quality:** Each skill undergoes careful review to ensure reliability and practical usefulness.\n- **Community-Powered:** We grow through community contributions, creating a collaborative space for learning and building together.\n\n## Licensing\n\nMost content in this repository uses the Apache License 2.0. However, some skills (such as Anthropic document skills or Notion skills) have different licenses. These are included in our index but not stored in the data folder. Please respect the specific license terms when using these skills.\n\n## Data Storage Policy\n\nWe prefer storing skill data within the repository rather than referencing external sources for three main reasons:\n\n- **License Consistency:** Hosting data directly ensures it's covered by our Apache 2.0 license, maintaining consistent licensing across the repository.\n- **Integrity Assurance:** Storing data in the repository allows thorough code reviews and guarantees content remains unchanged over time, protecting against potential tampering or unexpected modifications in external sources.\n- **Convenient Access:** Users can download all skill data at once using git, instead of downloading each skill individually through multiple web services.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project is made possible by the community members who share their skills and improvements. Thank you for your contributions!\n\n![contributors](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=x-cmd/skill)\n\n## License\n\nThe main repository operates under the Apache License 2.0. Please check individual folders or files, as some skills may have different licensing terms.\n"
