        "README.md": "# AgenticDev\n\n**AgenticDev** is a modular, spec-driven development methodology designed to empower AI agents and developers to build software efficiently, safely, and autonomously. It provides a structured framework that bridges the gap between high-level ideas and production-ready code.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nAgenticDev operates on a simple but rigorous principle: **Think before you code.**\n\n1.  **Spec-First**: Every feature starts with a written specification (\"spec\").\n2.  **Verification Loops**: Implementation is bound by TDD cycles—reproduction first, then fix.\n3.  **Atomic Execution**: Work is broken down into small, manageable units (Issues).\n4.  **Autonomous Integration**: Merging code triggers automated documentation updates and cleanup.\n\n## The Workflow\n\nThe AgenticDev lifecycle moves a project from concept to completion through four distinct phases:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"Phase 1: Discovery & Planning\"\n        A[Idea] --> B{prd-authoring}\n        B --> C[Product Brief / Research / PRD]\n        C --> D{spec-authoring}\n        D --> E[Draft Spec & Spec PR]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Phase 2: Organization\"\n        E -- Approved --> F{sprint-planner}\n        F --> G[Decompose into Atomic Issues]\n        G --> H[Create GitHub Milestone]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Phase 3: Execution\"\n        H --> I{issue-executor}\n        I --> J[Context Loading & TDD Plan]\n        J --> K[Feature Branch w/ Repro Script]\n        K --> L[Implementation & Verification]\n        L --> M[Code PR]\n        H --> N{sprint-manager}\n        N -- Co-ordinates --> I\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Phase 4: Integration\"\n        M -- Merged --> O{change-integrator}\n        O --> P[Promote Spec to Approved]\n        P --> Q[Update Retrospective]\n        Q --> R[Close Issues & Cleanup]\n    end\n```\n\n## Skills Catalog\n\nAll capabilities are implemented as modular \"Skills\" located in the `skills/` directory.\n\n### 1. Setup & Maintenance\n*   **`project-init`**: Scaffolds a new project with the required `docs/specs` and `docs/changes` structure.\n*   **`project-migrate`**: Intelligently migrates existing \"brownfield\" projects to the AgenticDev structure using AI analysis.\n*   **`agent-integrator`**: Updates the `AGENTS.md` file to register skills for agent discovery.\n*   **`skill-lister`**: Discovers and lists all available skills in the project.\n*   **`doc-validator`**: Enforces documentation standards and prevents \"doc sprawl\" by checking file locations.\n\n### 2. Planning & Discovery\n*   **`prd-authoring`**: Generates Product Briefs, Research Plans, and full PRDs from initial ideas using AI.\n*   **`spec-authoring`**: Manages the \"Spec PR\" workflow, drafting detailed technical specifications and analyzing PR feedback.\n*   **`doc-indexer`**: Scans project documentation to provide a just-in-time context map (frontmatter index) for the agent.\n\n### 3. Sprint Management\n*   **`sprint-planner`**: Decomposes approved specs (Epics) into atomic GitHub Issues and organizes them into milestones.\n*   **`sprint-manager`**: Orchestrates the autonomous execution of an entire sprint by coordinating sub-agents to implement issues serially.\n\n### 4. Execution & Integration\n*   **`issue-executor`**: The core workhorse. Takes a single issue, generates a TDD plan (Repro → Fix → Verify), creates a branch, and manages the implementation loop.\n*   **`change-integrator`**: Post-merge cleanup tool. Promotes specs to \"approved,\" updates the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` with learnings (auto-summarized), and closes related issues.\n*   **`frontend-design`**: A specialized agent for handling UI/UX tasks and frontend component design.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### For New Projects\n1.  Clone this repository or copy the `skills/` directory.\n2.  Run `bash skills/project-init/scripts/init-project.sh` to scaffold your docs.\n3.  Run `bash skills/agent-integrator/scripts/update-agents-file.sh` to create `AGENTS.md`.\n\n### For Existing Projects\n1.  Run `bash skills/project-migrate/scripts/project-migrate.sh` to analyze and migrate your docs.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe follow our own methodology:\n1.  Use `spec-authoring` to propose a change.\n2.  Submit a Spec PR.\n3.  Once approved, we'll plan it into the next sprint.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - See LICENSE file for details."
