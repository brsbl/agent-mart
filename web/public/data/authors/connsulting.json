        "plugins/compound-learning/README.md": "# Compound Learning Plugin\n\nA learning compounding system for Claude Code that extracts and indexes knowledge from conversations using ChromaDB for semantic search.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe compound learning plugin enables Claude to learn from previous conversations by:\n- Extracting key learnings from sessions via the `/compound` command\n- Extracting learnings from GitHub PR reviews via the `/pr-learnings` command\n- Indexing learnings into ChromaDB with semantic embeddings\n- Automatically searching relevant past learnings when starting new tasks\n- Supporting hierarchical scoping (global and repository-specific learnings)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.x\n- Docker (for ChromaDB container)\n- Python packages: `chromadb`\n- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - optional, required for `/pr-learnings` command\n\n## Installation\n\n### From Remote Repository\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace\n/plugin marketplace add Connsulting/claude-code-plugins\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install compound-learning@connsulting-plugins\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Clone or download this plugin to your Claude plugins directory\n2. Install Python dependencies:\n```bash\npip install chromadb\n```\n\n### Post-Installation Setup\n\nStart the ChromaDB database:\n```\n/start-learning-db\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration uses environment variables and an optional config file. The plugin works with sensible defaults out of the box.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nSet these in your shell profile or `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n| Variable | Description | Default |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `CHROMADB_HOST` | ChromaDB server hostname | `localhost` |\n| `CHROMADB_PORT` | ChromaDB server port | `8000` |\n| `CHROMADB_DATA_DIR` | Persistent storage location | `~/.claude/chroma-data` |\n| `LEARNINGS_GLOBAL_DIR` | Global learnings directory | `~/.projects/learnings` |\n| `LEARNINGS_REPO_SEARCH_PATH` | Base path to search for repo learnings | `~` |\n| `LEARNINGS_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` | Similarity threshold (0-1, lower = more similar) | `0.5` |\n\n**Example in `.claude/settings.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"LEARNINGS_GLOBAL_DIR\": \"/home/user/my-learnings\",\n    \"LEARNINGS_REPO_SEARCH_PATH\": \"/home/user/projects\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Config File Override\n\nFor more complex configuration, create `.claude-plugin/config.json` in the plugin directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chromadb\": {\n    \"host\": \"localhost\",\n    \"port\": 8000,\n    \"dataDir\": \"${HOME}/.claude/chroma-data\"\n  },\n  \"learnings\": {\n    \"globalDir\": \"${HOME}/.projects/learnings\",\n    \"repoSearchPath\": \"${HOME}\",\n    \"distanceThreshold\": 0.5\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`${HOME}` is expanded to your home directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating Learnings\n\nAfter a productive session, use the `/compound` command:\n```\n/compound\nWent well: [successes]\nWent poorly: [failures]\nRecommendations: [improvements]\n```\n\nThis extracts learnings and commits them to the appropriate scope:\n- **Global learnings** (`~/.projects/learnings/`): Applicable across all projects\n- **Repo learnings** (`[repo]/.projects/learnings/`): Specific to a repository\n\n### Extracting Learnings from PRs\n\nExtract learnings from GitHub pull request reviews and feedback:\n\n```\n/pr-learnings <PR-URL-or-number> [<PR-URL-or-number> ...]\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Single PR by URL\n/pr-learnings https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123\n\n# Multiple PRs\n/pr-learnings 123 456 789\n\n# Mix of URLs and numbers\n/pr-learnings https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 456\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Fetches PR data including reviews, comments, and code changes using GitHub CLI\n2. Analyzes reviewer feedback for patterns and insights\n3. Extracts 1-3 meaningful learnings per PR\n4. Saves learnings in the same format as `/compound`\n\n**Use cases:**\n- **Individual developers**: Learn from feedback on your PRs\n- **Team leads**: Extract learnings from team PRs and share across the organization\n- **Code review insights**: Identify patterns in common mistakes\n\nAfter running `/pr-learnings`, remember to run `/index-learnings` to make the new learnings searchable.\n\n### Searching Learnings\n\nLearnings are automatically searched at the start of tasks. To manually search:\n```\nSkill(skill=\"search-learnings\", args=\"JWT authentication patterns\")\n```\n\n### Rebuilding the Index\n\nTo re-index all learning files:\n```\n/index-learnings\n```\n\nThis also generates a **manifest** at `~/.projects/learnings/MANIFEST.md` summarizing learnings by topic.\n\n### Learnings Manifest\n\nThe manifest helps Claude decide when to search by showing what topics have learnings:\n\n```markdown\n# Learnings Manifest\nGenerated: 2026-02-03T14:30:00Z\n\n## Global Learnings (47 total, 3 gotchas)\n\n| Topic | Count | Keywords |\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| authentication | 12 (2⚠️) | jwt, oauth, refresh, session |\n| error-handling | 8 | retry, timeout, fallback |\n| other | 2 | |\n\n## Repo: my-project (23 total)\n\n| Topic | Count | Keywords |\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| api-integration | 9 | github, slack, webhook |\n```\n\n- Topics and keywords come from `**Topic:**` and `**Tags:**` fields in learning files\n- `**Type:** gotcha` learnings are flagged with ⚠️\n\n### Auto-Extraction via Hooks\n\nThe plugin automatically extracts learnings at key moments without manual intervention:\n\n- **PreCompact**: Before context compaction (when conversation gets long), learnings are extracted to preserve insights that might otherwise be lost\n- **Stop**: When Claude finishes responding, learnings are extracted from the session\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Hooks trigger `extract-learnings.sh` which invokes `claude -p` to analyze the transcript\n2. Claude reads the conversation transcript and identifies 0-3 meaningful learnings\n3. Learning files are written directly to the appropriate scope (global or repo)\n4. A session tracking file (`~/.claude/compound-processed-sessions`) prevents duplicate extraction\n\n**Debug log:** Check `~/.claude/compound-hook-debug.log` to see when hooks fire.\n\n**Note:** The extraction uses minimal permissions (`Read`, `Write`, `Bash(mkdir:*)`) and skips trivial sessions (<20 transcript lines).\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Components\n\n- **Commands:**\n  - `/compound`: Extracts learnings from conversations and commits to appropriate scope\n  - `/pr-learnings`: Extracts learnings from GitHub PR reviews, comments, and code changes\n  - `/index-learnings`: Re-indexes all learning files into ChromaDB\n  - `/start-learning-db`: Starts ChromaDB Docker container\n  - `/consolidate-learnings`: Finds and merges duplicate or overlapping learnings\n\n- **Agents:**\n  - `learning-writer`: Analyzes conversations and extracts learnings\n  - `pr-learning-extractor`: Analyzes GitHub PRs and extracts learnings from reviews\n  - `consolidation-analyzer`: Analyzes learning overlap and recommends merge/keep actions\n\n- **Skills:**\n  - `search-learnings`: Queries ChromaDB for relevant learnings with hierarchical scoping\n  - `start-learning-db`: Starts ChromaDB container using Docker\n  - `index-learnings`: Indexes all learning markdown files into ChromaDB\n  - `consolidate-discovery`: Finds consolidation candidates in ChromaDB\n  - `consolidate-actions`: Executes consolidation actions (merge, archive, delete)\n\n- **Hooks:**\n  - `PreCompact`: Auto-extracts learnings before context compaction\n  - `Stop`: Auto-extracts learnings when Claude finishes responding\n\n### Learning Scopes\n\n1. **Global** (`~/.projects/learnings/`): Security patterns, general best practices, cross-project knowledge\n2. **Repo** (`[repo]/.projects/learnings/`): Repository-specific gotchas, patterns, architecture decisions\n\nThe search skill automatically detects which repository you're working in and includes both global learnings and learnings from parent directories in the hierarchy.\n\n## Recommended CLAUDE.md Configuration\n\nAdd this to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```markdown\n## Learning Compounding\n\n@~/.projects/learnings/MANIFEST.md\n\n**When to search:** If manifest shows a topic matching your task, search for it.\n**When to skip:** If no relevant topic in manifest, don't search.\n\n**Search:** `Skill(skill=\"compound-learning:search-learnings\", args=\"[topic] [context]\")`\n**Peek:** Add `--peek --exclude-ids [seen-ids]` when shifting to a new manifest topic mid-conversation.\n\nUse topic + context: \"authentication JWT refresh\" not \"implement login feature\"\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**ChromaDB won't start:**\n- Ensure Docker is running\n- Check if port 8000 is already in use\n- View logs: `docker logs claude-learning-db`\n\n**No learnings found:**\n- Verify learning files exist in configured paths\n- Run `/index-learnings` to re-index\n- Check config paths in `.claude-plugin/config.json`\n\n**Search returns no results:**\n- Check `distanceThreshold` setting (try increasing to 0.7)\n- Verify ChromaDB is running\n- Ensure learnings have been indexed\n\n## Development\n\nThe plugin uses upsert operations for indexing, making it safe to re-run indexing without creating duplicates. ChromaDB data persists in the configured `dataDir` across container restarts.\n"
