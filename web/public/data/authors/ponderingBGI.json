        "README.md": "# Ralph-Loop++\n\nAn advanced Claude Code plugin for autonomous, long-running optimization tasks using the Ralph Wiggum technique with parallel workers and git worktree isolation.\n\n## What is Ralph-Loop++?\n\nRalph-Loop++ extends the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) to create a sophisticated multi-agent optimization system. Give it an abstract but measurable goal in natural language, and it will:\n\n1. **Create a verification test** to measure your optimization target\n2. **Spawn parallel workers** in isolated git worktrees\n3. **Iterate autonomously** until the goal is achieved\n4. **Evaluate solutions** for quality and \"spirit\" compliance\n5. **Integrate cleanly** following your codebase conventions\n6. **Create a PR** with the optimized code\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the marketplace:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add ponderingBGI/ralph-loop-pp\n```\n\nInstall ralph-loop++:\n```\n/plugin install ralph-loop-pp@ralph-loop-pp\n```\n\nInstall the required Ralph Wiggum plugin:\n```\n/plugin install ralph-wiggum@claude-plugins-official\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust describe what you want to optimize in natural language:\n\n```bash\n# Performance optimization\n/optimize Reduce the API response time for /users endpoint to under 50ms p95 latency\n\n# Memory optimization\n/optimize Improve GPU memory efficiency for the renderer - target under 800MB peak\n\n# Bug fixing\n/optimize Fix the flaky tests in the auth module so they pass consistently\n\n# Code quality\n/optimize Increase test coverage for the payment module to at least 90%\n\n# General improvement\n/optimize Make the dashboard load faster - it currently takes 3 seconds\n```\n\n### Other Commands\n\n```bash\n/optimize-status     # Check current progress\n/cancel-optimize     # Stop all workers and clean up\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nUser Task → Orchestrator → Test Architect → Parallel Workers\n                ↓                ↓                ↓\n            Evaluates      Creates Test      Ralph Loop\n                ↓                ↓           (max 20 iter)\n           Integrator ← Accept/Refine ← Metric Check\n                ↓\n         Clean Code → Commit → PR\n```\n\n### Agents\n\n| Agent | Role |\n|-------|------|\n| **Orchestrator** | Parses request, coordinates workflow, manages state |\n| **Test Architect** | Creates verification tests that measure the target metric |\n| **Worker** | Explores solutions in isolated worktree using Ralph loop |\n| **Evaluator** | Assesses worker solutions for quality and \"spirit\" |\n| **Integrator** | Creates clean, production-ready implementation |\n\n### Workflow\n\n1. **Parse**: The orchestrator extracts goals from your natural language request\n2. **Test**: A verification test is created to measure the target metric\n3. **Explore**: 2-3 workers try different approaches in isolated worktrees\n4. **Iterate**: Each worker runs in a Ralph loop (up to 20 iterations)\n5. **Evaluate**: Solutions are checked for quality and genuine improvement\n6. **Integrate**: The best approach is reimplemented following codebase conventions\n7. **Commit**: Changes are committed and optionally a PR is created\n\n## Features\n\n### Natural Language Interface\nNo flags or complex syntax - just describe what you want to achieve.\n\n### Parallel Workers\nMultiple workers explore different approaches simultaneously. The evaluator picks the best solution or combines insights.\n\n### Git Worktree Isolation\nWorkers operate in isolated worktrees, so experiments don't affect your main codebase.\n\n### Spirit Compliance\nThe evaluator checks that solutions genuinely achieve the goal rather than \"gaming\" the metric.\n\n### Automatic Tool Selection\nThe orchestrator curates which tools each worker can access based on the task, preventing misuse.\n\n### State Persistence\nProgress is saved to `.claude/ralph-plus.local.md`, enabling recovery if interrupted.\n\n## Configuration\n\nRalph-Loop++ works with your existing Claude Code setup:\n\n- **MCP Servers**: Uses whatever you have configured (Context7 and Exa recommended for research)\n- **Permissions**: Inherits from your project's settings\n- **Git**: Respects your git configuration and hooks\n\n## Examples\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n```bash\n/optimize Reduce API response time for /users endpoint to under 50ms\n```\n\n**What happens:**\n1. Creates a benchmark test hitting the endpoint\n2. Worker 1 tries connection pooling\n3. Worker 2 tries query optimization\n4. Evaluator selects best approach\n5. Integrator creates clean implementation\n6. PR created with performance comparison\n\n### Memory Leak Fix\n\n```bash\n/optimize Fix the memory leak in WebSocket connection handler - target under 100MB growth over 1000 connections\n```\n\n**What happens:**\n1. Creates a stress test measuring memory growth\n2. Workers investigate and fix different leak sources\n3. Multiple cycles as evaluator finds edge cases\n4. Final implementation with proper cleanup patterns\n\n## State File\n\nProgress is tracked in `.claude/ralph-plus.local.md`:\n\n```yaml\n---\nactive: true\nsession_id: \"rp-1704567890123\"\nphase: \"worker_exploration\"\ntask: \"Reduce API response time...\"\nbaseline_metric: 120\nbest_metric: 65\nworkers:\n  - id: 1\n    iterations: 12\n    best_metric: 65\n    approach: \"Connection pooling\"\n---\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code CLI\n- [Ralph Wiggum plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)\n- Git (for worktree management)\n\n### System Dependencies\n\nThe plugin requires these command-line tools:\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `jq` | JSON parsing in test output |\n| `bc` | Floating-point metric comparisons |\n\n**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**\n```bash\napt-get install jq bc\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\nbrew install jq bc\n```\n\nNote: Some advanced features use `flock` and `timeout` which are Linux-specific. On macOS, the plugin uses fallback implementations.\n\n## Recommended MCP Servers\n\nFor best research capabilities:\n- **Context7** - Library documentation lookup\n- **Exa** - Semantic web/code search\n\n## Cost Considerations\n\nThis plugin is designed for long-running, background operations. Costs depend on:\n- Number of parallel workers (default: 2)\n- Iterations per worker (max: 20)\n- Evaluation cycles (default max: 3)\n- Model used (Opus for orchestrator/evaluator, Sonnet for workers)\n\nA typical optimization task might cost $10-50 depending on complexity.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"No active session\"\nUse `/optimize <task>` to start a new optimization.\n\n### Workers not progressing\nCheck `/optimize-status` for current state. Workers might be stuck on research or hitting rate limits.\n\n### Worktrees not cleaning up\nRun: `./plugin/scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh --all`\n\n### Test creation fails\nThe test architect couldn't create a suitable test. Try being more specific about what to measure.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! Please open an issue to discuss significant changes.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) by Geoffrey Huntley\n- Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)\n"
