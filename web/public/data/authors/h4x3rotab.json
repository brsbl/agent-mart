        "README.md": "# redpill-vault\n\nRedpill-vault is a secure credential manager for all your AI tools. It stores your API keys and context safely, so you never re-enter them between sessions, and they never touch LLM chats.\n\nYour keys are encrypted and sync privately across your devices. Stop pasting keys. Start coding.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js\n- `psst` (installed automatically and exposed on PATH by this package)\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g redpill-vault\n```\n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\n# 1) Initialize vault + hook in your project\nrv init\n\n# 2) Register which secrets this repo is allowed to use\nrv add OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n# 3) Store the secret in psst (global vault)\npsst --global set OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n# 4) Approve this project for injection\nrv approve\n```\n\nAfter approval, any Bash command run by the agent is wrapped with `rv-exec`, and the secrets listed in `.rv.json` are injected as environment variables.\n\n## Claude Code plugin\n\nInstall the plugin marketplace and plugin:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/h4x3rotab/redpill-vault\nclaude plugin install redpill-vault@redpill-vault-marketplace\n```\n\nThen ask Claude to run the skill:\n\n```\nUse the redpill-vault skill to set up redpill-vault for this project.\n```\n\nClaude will run `rv init`. You still need to run `rv approve` yourself.\n\n## Common commands\n\n```bash\nrv add <KEY>        # add key to .rv.json\nrv remove <KEY>     # remove key from .rv.json\nrv list             # list keys in .rv.json\nrv approve          # allow this project to inject its secrets\nrv revoke           # remove approval\nrv check            # verify keys exist in psst\nrv doctor           # full health check\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Secrets are injected per-project based on `.rv.json` and approval state.\n- The agent never sees secret values; `rv-exec` resolves them at execution time via `psst`.\n"
