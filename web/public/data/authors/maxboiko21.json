        "plugins/code-splitter/README.md": "# Code Splitter Plugin\n\nIntelligently scan and refactor large code files into smaller, maintainable action-pattern based components following language and framework conventions.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Codebase Scanning**: Automatically identify files that need refactoring based on size, complexity, and pattern conventions\n- **File Splitting**: Refactor specific files into smaller, focused action/component files\n- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with Laravel, Symfony, React, Vue, and Node.js projects\n- **Action Pattern Enforcement**: Generates code following action pattern conventions (app/Actions for Laravel, custom patterns for other frameworks)\n- **Smart Detection**: Auto-detects project type from dependencies (composer.json, package.json)\n- **Project Configuration**: Customize thresholds and conventions per project using `.claude/code-splitter.local.md`\n- **Factory/Seeder Support**: Automatically generates Laravel factories and seeders when refactoring models\n- **Import Management**: Updates imports and references automatically after refactoring\n- **Validation**: Validates generated code and suggests improvements\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Plugin will be available at ~/.claude-plugins/code-splitter/\n# Enable it in Claude Code settings or use: cc --plugin-dir ~/.claude-plugins/code-splitter/\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Scan Entire Codebase\n\n```\n/scan-code\n```\n\nAnalyzes your entire codebase and identifies files that need refactoring:\n- Files exceeding size thresholds (default: >300 lines)\n- Files with too many methods/functions (default: >10)\n- Files violating action pattern conventions\n- Shows interactive list of candidates with metrics\n- You can select which files to refactor\n\n### Split a Specific File\n\n```\n/split-code <file-path>\n```\n\nRefactors a specific file into smaller, focused components:\n- Analyzes the file and proposes a refactoring plan\n- Shows which methods/sections will be extracted\n- You can manually select which extractions to perform\n- Creates new action/component files following conventions\n- Updates imports and references automatically\n- Validates syntax and suggests improvements\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nCreate `.claude/code-splitter.local.md` in your project root to customize behavior:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# Laravel Settings\nlaravel_actions_path: app/Actions\nlaravel_generate_factories: true\nlaravel_generate_seeders: true\n\n# React/Vue Settings\nreact_components_path: src/components\nvue_components_path: src/components\n\n# Node.js Settings\nnode_services_path: src/services\nnode_utils_path: src/utils\n\n# Refactoring Thresholds\nline_threshold: 300\nmethod_threshold: 10\ncyclomatic_complexity_threshold: 10\n\n# Language-Specific Overrides\nphp_action_namespace: \"App\\\\Actions\"\njs_module_extension: \".ts\"\n---\n\n# Add any additional notes or conventions\n```\n\nAll fields are optional. Plugin uses sensible defaults and auto-detects project type.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Scanning**: Analyzes codebase structure, file sizes, complexity metrics, and pattern violations\n2. **Detection**: Identifies refactoring candidates based on configurable thresholds\n3. **Planning**: Creates a detailed refactoring plan showing which code will be extracted\n4. **Approval**: Shows plan to user for manual selection and approval\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Creates new action/component files\n   - Updates all imports and references\n   - Validates generated code\n   - Suggests quality improvements\n\n## Supported Patterns\n\n### Laravel\n- Controllers → Action classes in `app/Actions/`\n- Models → Traits and related actions\n- Services → Modular service classes\n- Factories and Seeders auto-generation\n\n### React / Vue\n- Large components → Smaller focused components\n- Complex logic → Custom hooks / composables\n- Props management → Component composition\n\n### Node.js\n- Large service files → Focused service modules\n- Complex logic → Utility modules\n- Route handlers → Separate handler functions\n\n## Settings & Conventions\n\nThe plugin respects your project's existing conventions:\n- **Laravel**: Follows action pattern from your coding standards\n- **React**: Uses your component folder structure\n- **Node.js**: Respects your service organization\n- **General**: All thresholds and paths are configurable\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use `/scan-code` first to identify candidates across your entire codebase\n- Run `/split-code` on individual files for precise control\n- Configure `.claude/code-splitter.local.md` once per project for consistent refactoring\n- The agent validates all generated code and won't create invalid files\n\n## Skills Included\n\n- **Code Refactoring Patterns**: Learn refactoring principles and best practices\n- **Language-Specific Action Patterns**: Understand framework-specific conventions for your project type\n\n## Feedback\n\nReport issues or suggest improvements at the project repository.\n",
        "plugins/git-plugin/README.md": "# git-plugin\n\nPersonal git workflow commands for Claude Code: smart commit, PR creation, and code review.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin add /path/to/git-plugin\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/commit` — Smart commit with validation\n\nCommits staged changes with auto-generated conventional commit messages.\n\n```bash\n/commit                    # auto-generate message from staged diff\n/commit fix: typo in auth  # use provided message verbatim\n```\n\nWhat it does:\n- Scans staged diff for issues (TODO/FIXME, `console.log`, commented-out code) and warns before committing\n- Generates conventional commit messages (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, etc.)\n- Multi-line body for complex changes (bullet list, max 5 items)\n\nWhat it does NOT do:\n- Stage files — only commits what you've already staged\n- Push, amend, or add Co-Authored-By\n\nUses `haiku` model to keep it fast and cheap.\n\n### `/pr` — Create PR with description\n\nPushes the current branch and creates a GitHub PR via `gh`.\n\n```bash\n/pr                        # auto-generate title from commits\n/pr feat: user dashboard   # use provided title\n```\n\nWhat it does:\n- Warns about uncommitted/staged changes before proceeding\n- Checks if a PR already exists for the branch\n- Generates PR body with summary bullets from commits and diff\n- Pushes branch and creates PR targeting `main`\n\nRequires: [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated.\n\n### `/review` — Review current changes\n\nReviews uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged) for real issues.\n\n```bash\n/review                # full review\n/review security       # focus on security\n/review src/auth.ts    # focus on specific file\n```\n\nChecks for:\n- **Security** — injection, exposed secrets, path traversal\n- **Performance** — N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, blocking calls\n- **Logic errors** — off-by-one, null access, race conditions, missing error handling\n\nFindings grouped by severity: Critical > Warning > Info. No nitpicking — skips if nothing found.\n\nUses `sonnet` model for deeper analysis.\n\n### `/devlog` — Create Notion DevLog entry\n\nCreates a DevLog entry in Notion for the last commit. Useful for testing or ad-hoc logging.\n\n```bash\n/devlog                          # log last commit\n/devlog added retry logic to API # add extra context to summary\n```\n\nWhat it does:\n- Reads last commit info (hash, message, date, diff stats)\n- Classifies type from conventional commit prefix (feat→Feature, fix→Bug, etc.)\n- Finds or creates project in Notion Projects DB by repo name\n- Queries last 100 DevLog entries for related logs and auto-links them\n- Creates DevLog entry with summary, time estimate, and commit URL\n\nRequires: Notion MCP integration configured (see setup below).\n\nUses `haiku` model to keep it fast and cheap.\n\n## Hooks\n\n### Auto-format on file write\n\nAutomatically formats files after Claude writes or edits them. Triggers on `PostToolUse` for `Write` and `Edit` tools.\n\nSupported formatters (auto-detected by walking up the directory tree):\n\n| Extension | Formatter |\n|---|---|\n| `.php` | Laravel Pint (`vendor/bin/pint`) |\n| `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` | Prettier (`node_modules/.bin/prettier`) |\n| `.go` | `gofmt` |\n\nNo config needed — if the formatter binary exists in the project, it runs. If not, silently skips.\n\n### Auto DevLog on commit\n\nAutomatically creates a Notion DevLog entry after every successful `git commit`. Triggers on `PostToolUse` for `Bash` tool.\n\n- Detects `git commit` commands (skips `--amend`)\n- Verifies commit succeeded (checks for `[branch hash]` output)\n- Spawns a background Claude process with Notion MCP access\n- Non-blocking — hook exits immediately, DevLog creation happens in background\n\nSame logic as `/devlog`: classifies type, finds/creates project, links related logs, creates entry.\n\nRequires: Notion MCP integration configured (see setup below).\n\n## Notion MCP Setup\n\nThe `/devlog` command and auto-devlog hook require Notion MCP integration:\n\n1. Install a Notion MCP plugin or configure Notion MCP manually\n2. The MCP endpoint is `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`\n3. Auth via OAuth — run `/mcp` and follow the Notion auth flow\n4. Grant access to your Projects and DevLog databases in Notion integration settings\n"
