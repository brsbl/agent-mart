        "README.md": "# Claude Debug Mode Plugin\n\nA hypothesis-based debugging skill for Claude Code, inspired by Cursor's Debug Mode. Uses runtime evidence and systematic hypothesis testing to identify and fix bugs.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add kerdofficial/claude-debug-mode\n/plugin install claude-debug-mode@kerd-debug-mode\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you ask Claude to debug your code, it will:\n\n1. **Think of possible causes** - Generate several hypotheses about what might be wrong\n2. **Add logging** - Insert temporary logs in your code to test each hypothesis\n3. **Ask you to run it** - You reproduce the bug while logs collect data\n4. **Analyze the evidence** - Claude reads the logs and identifies the actual cause\n5. **Fix it** - Apply a targeted fix based on real data\n6. **Verify** - You test again to confirm it works\n7. **Clean up** - Remove all the temporary logging code\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply ask Claude Code to debug something:\n\n- \"Help me debug this function\"\n- \"Debug this - the API returns null sometimes\"\n- \"Why isn't this working?\"\n- \"Find this bug in the authentication flow\"\n\nor just simply use the `/debug-mode` command and describe the bug, for example:\n\n```bash\n/debug-mode We have a bug in the inventory management system. When we try to reorder an item, it returns the wrong quantity.\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2026 Kerekes Dániel\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
