How does Linear model project hierarchies? What retry strategies does our queue library actually support? `/research` digs through docs, **OSS code repos**, and articles so you get a sourced report instead of guessing or tab-hopping.\n\n**Use case 2: Skill generation.** Same `/research` step as above, but then `/write-skill` distills the findings into a SKILL.md that agents can execute. The report is raw analytical knowledge; the skill is the operationalized workflow from that knowledge.\n\n## Using Them\n\n## Using `research`\n\nInvoke by typing `/research <topic>` within Claude Code or Cursor.\n\n### Common examples\n\n```\n# New research (defaults to formal report)\n/research How does Temporal handle workflow versioning?\n\n# Quick answer (no report)\n/research Just tell me — does Better Auth support SCIM?\n\n# Extend an existing report\n/research Update the claude-plugins-architecture report with Cowork CLI parity findings\n\n# Compare systems\n/research Compare pg-boss vs BullMQ for job queues — focus on persistence, retry, and observability\n```\n\n### What it does\n\nConducts evidence-driven research and produces one of three outputs:\n\n- **Formal report** — persistent artifact in `~/.claude/reports/<name>/` with evidence files. **Default** for non-trivial research.\n- **Report update** — refinement or additions to an existing report. Triggered when you're iterating on an existing report or mention it e.g. `update X report with new research on XYZ`. Automatically figures out best way to update the report.\n- **Direct answer** — findings delivered in conversation. Used when you say \"just tell me\" or it's a quick question.\n\n### Report structure\n\nReports live in `~/.claude/reports/<name>/` with:\n- `REPORT.md` — synthesized findings with executive summary, rubric, detailed sections\n- `evidence/*.md` — primary-source proof files (one per dimension)\n- `meta/_changelog.md` — append-only history of updates\n\nTo open the directory of reports in Cursor:\n`cursor ~/.claude/reports` or simply navigate to it.\n\nIn MacOS, while in a Home directory (e.g. `nickgomez/`, click on `cmd + shift + . ` to see hidden `.claude` folder.)\n\n### Key behaviors\n\n- **Checks existing reports first.** Before starting new research, it scans `~/.claude/reports/` for overlap. If prior research covers a topic, it surfaces those findings and asks whether to reuse, extend, or start fresh.\n- **Scopes before researching.** It proposes a research rubric (dimensions, depth, stance) and waits for a confirmation before diving in. You can adjust scope, add/remove dimensions, or change the output format.\n- **Evidence-backed.** Every finding links to an evidence file with primary sources (code snippets for OSS repos, doc quotes, research studies, etc.). Claims are labeled CONFIRMED / INFERRED / UNCERTAIN / NOT FOUND. **Auto-prioritizes by time and authority**.\n- **Recaps and suggests follow-ups.** After delivering findings, it summarizes key results and offers 2-4 natural next directions.\n\n---\n\n## Using `write-skill`\n\n### Common interactions\n\n```\n# Create a new skill from scratch\n/write-skill Create a skill for writing cold outbound emails called 'write-email'\n\n# Create a new skill from a report\n/write-skill Create a skill for writing cold outbound emails by looking at the 'b2b-outbound-email' report and evidence. Help me turn that knowledge into a skill 'write-email'.\n```\n\nInvoke with `/write-skill <goal>` when you want to create or modify an Agent Skill.\n\n### What it does\n\nGuides you through authoring a SKILL.md (+ optional references/, scripts/, templates/) that works across Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents supporting the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io).\n\n### Key behaviors\n\n- **Asks clarifying questions first.** Captures intent, audience, constraints, and success criteria before drafting. For ambiguous requests, it offers 2-4 targeted questions with recommended defaults.\n- **Outputs the full skill.** Delivers folder tree + complete file contents. No partial stubs.\n- **Use to update a skill as well!** If you give it feedback on how a skill could behave better (e.g. after trying out a real skill elsewhere), it'll procedurally update the skill in a conservative way to align it with what you describe as the correct behavior.\n\n### Skill structure it produces\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Main skill (frontmatter + workflow)\n├── references/           # Deep-dive docs loaded on demand\n├── scripts/              # Executable utilities\n└── templates/            # Reusable output templates\n```\n\n### Auto-improving skills\n\n```\n# Update an existing skill (preserves intent)\n/write-skill The emails being produced by 'write-email' sound too abstract for the 'b2b-, help me update the skill so that the emails don't use abstract concepts.\n\n```\n\nNote: after using a skill in an interactive session, you can invoke /write-skill at the end of the session and give it feedback how that session could have gone better.\n\n---\n\n## Using `write-agent`\n\nClaude-code specific skill that creates or updates Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`). Handles single-purpose subagents and multi-phase workflow orchestrators.\n\nUseful pattern:\n\n```bash\n/write-agent can you take skills /research-prospect and /write-email and help me write an agent that researches prospects and writes a sequenece of emails?\n```",

Updates are manual.\n\n```bash\nnpx skills add inkeep/team-skills/plugins/eng -y\n```\n\nTo update:\n\n```bash\nnpx skills update\n```\n\n---\n\n## Skill inventory\n\nSkills are on-demand procedural knowledge that Claude loads when relevant. They are not always-on (that's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) and not deterministic actions (that's tools/MCP). Think of them as \"how an experienced engineer would approach X\" — portable across repos and contexts.\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/ship` | User or model | End-to-end feature development orchestrator: spec through merge-ready PR |\n| `/spec` | User or model | Interactive spec authoring (PRD + technical design) |\n| `/ralph` | User or model | Autonomous implementation methodology: SPEC.md to working code via iterative loop |\n| `/review` | User or model | PR review iteration: poll feedback, assess, fix, resolve threads, drive CI green |\n| `/inspect` | User or model | Codebase inspection — discover patterns, trace flows, map blast radius |\n| `/research` | User or model | Technical research with optional persistent reports |\n| `tdd` | Model-only | Background knowledge for behavior-focused testing (auto-loaded; key principles distilled inline in spec, ship, and ralph) |\n| `/write-skill` | User or model | Author or update Claude Code skills (SKILL.md + supporting files) |\n| `/write-agent` | User or model | Design Claude Code agents and agent prompts (.claude/agents/*.md) |\n| `/analyze` | User or model | Deep, iterative, evidence-based analysis of situations, decisions, and trade-offs |\n\n**Shared:** `research`, `write-skill`, `write-agent`\n\nAdd eng-only skills by creating a folder in `plugins/eng/skills/`.\n\n---\n\n## How the skills relate\n\n`/ship` is the top-level orchestrator. It composes the other skills into an end-to-end workflow:\n\n```\n/ship\n ├── Phase 0: Detect context (capabilities, execution environment)\n ├── Phase 1A: /spec ─── interactive spec authoring with the user\n ├── Phase 1B: Validate spec, /inspect the codebase, /ralph Phase 1 (convert to prd.json)\n ├── Phase 2: Environment setup (worktree or container branch)\n ├── Phase 3: /ralph Phases 2-4 (implementation via /ralph-loop or ship-managed iteration)\n ├── Phase 4: Testing (Tier 1 formal + Tier 2 QA + Tier 3 edge cases)\n ├── Phase 5: /review (PR feedback loop + CI/CD resolution)\n └── Phase 6: Completion\n```\n\nEach composed skill also works standalone — you can invoke `/spec`, `/ralph`, `/review`, `/inspect`, or `/research` independently without going through `/ship`.\n\n---\n\n## Execution contexts\n\nSkills work across three execution environments. `/ship` detects the context in Phase 0 and passes capability information to composed skills. Standalone skills use sensible defaults and degrade gracefully.\n\n| Context | What's available | What degrades |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Direct on host** | Everything — git, gh CLI, browser, macOS tools, ralph-loop | Nothing (full capability) |\n| **Git worktree** | Same as host, isolated directory | Nothing (full capability) |\n| **Docker container** | Git, filesystem — but no gh CLI, no browser, no macOS tools, possibly no ralph-loop | PR creation/review skipped, browser testing substituted with Bash, ship manages iteration if ralph-loop unavailable |\n\n---\n\n## When to use which skill\n\n| You want to... | Use |\n|---|---|\n| Build a feature end-to-end from idea to PR | `/ship` |\n| Write a spec (PRD + tech design) | `/spec` |\n| Convert a spec to prd.json and implement iteratively | `/ralph` |\n| Iterate on PR review feedback and get CI green | `/review` |\n| Understand patterns or trace code flow before acting | `/inspect` |\n| Investigate a technology, compare approaches, gather evidence | `/research` |\n| Analyze a decision, situation, or trade-off in depth | `/analyze` |\n| Create or update a skill | `/write-skill` |\n| Create or update a subagent definition | `/write-agent` |\n",
