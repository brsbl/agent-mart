Choose based on your setup:\n\n| | Claude Code Plugin (recommended) | Skills CLI |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Auto-update** | Yes — skills update every session | No — manual `npx skills update` |\n| **Agent support** | Claude Code only | Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, etc. |\n| **Best for** | Claude Code-only users who want zero-maintenance updates | Multi-agent users (e.g., Cursor + Claude Code) |\n\n### Option A: Claude Code Plugin (recommended)\n\nAuto-updates on every session. Skills stay current without manual intervention.\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace with auto-update (one-time)\nclaude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/inkeep/team-skills.git && node -e \"const f=require('os').homedir()+'/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json',d=require(f);d['inkeep-team-skills'].autoUpdate=true;require('fs').writeFileSync(f,JSON.stringify(d,null,2));console.log('Auto-update enabled for inkeep-team-skills')\"\n\n# Install your team's plugin\nclaude plugin install eng@inkeep-team-skills    # engineering\nclaude plugin install gtm@inkeep-team-skills    # GTM\n```\n\n### Option B: Skills CLI (cross-agent)\n\nWorks with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

How does Linear model project hierarchies? What retry strategies does our queue library actually support? `/research` digs through docs, **OSS code repos**, and articles so you get a sourced report instead of guessing or tab-hopping.\n\n**Use case 2: Skill generation.** Same `/research` step as above, but then `/write-skill` distills the findings into a SKILL.md that agents can execute. The report is raw analytical knowledge; the skill is the operationalized workflow from that knowledge.\n\n## Using Them\n\n## Using `research`\n\nInvoke by typing `/research <topic>` within Claude Code or Cursor.\n\n### Common examples\n\n```\n# New research (defaults to formal report)\n/research How does Temporal handle workflow versioning?\n\n# Quick answer (no report)\n/research Just tell me — does Better Auth support SCIM?\n\n# Extend an existing report\n/research Update the claude-plugins-architecture report with Cowork CLI parity findings\n\n# Compare systems\n/research Compare pg-boss vs BullMQ for job queues — focus on persistence, retry, and observability\n```\n\n### What it does\n\nConducts evidence-driven research and produces one of three outputs:\n\n- **Formal report** — persistent artifact in `~/.claude/reports/<name>/` with evidence files. **Default** for non-trivial research.\n- **Report update** — refinement or additions to an existing report. Triggered when you're iterating on an existing report or mention it e.g. `update X report with new research on XYZ`. Automatically figures out best way to update the report.\n- **Direct answer** — findings delivered in conversation. Used when you say \"just tell me\" or it's a quick question.\n\n### Report structure\n\nReports live in `~/.claude/reports/<name>/` with:\n- `REPORT.md` — synthesized findings with executive summary, rubric, detailed sections\n- `evidence/*.md` — primary-source proof files (one per dimension)\n- `meta/_changelog.md` — append-only history of updates\n\nTo open the directory of reports in Cursor:\n`cursor ~/.claude/reports` or simply navigate to it.\n\nIn MacOS, while in a Home directory (e.g. `nickgomez/`, click on `cmd + shift + . ` to see hidden `.claude` folder.)\n\n### Key behaviors\n\n- **Checks existing reports first.** Before starting new research, it scans `~/.claude/reports/` for overlap. If prior research covers a topic, it surfaces those findings and asks whether to reuse, extend, or start fresh.\n- **Scopes before researching.** It proposes a research rubric (dimensions, depth, stance) and waits for a confirmation before diving in. You can adjust scope, add/remove dimensions, or change the output format.\n- **Evidence-backed.** Every finding links to an evidence file with primary sources (code snippets for OSS repos, doc quotes, research studies, etc.). Claims are labeled CONFIRMED / INFERRED / UNCERTAIN / NOT FOUND. **Auto-prioritizes by time and authority**.\n- **Recaps and suggests follow-ups.** After delivering findings, it summarizes key results and offers 2-4 natural next directions.\n\n---\n\n## Using `write-skill`\n\n### Common interactions\n\n```\n# Create a new skill from scratch\n/write-skill Create a skill for writing cold outbound emails called 'write-email'\n\n# Create a new skill from a report\n/write-skill Create a skill for writing cold outbound emails by looking at the 'b2b-outbound-email' report and evidence. Help me turn that knowledge into a skill 'write-email'.\n```\n\nInvoke with `/write-skill <goal>` when you want to create or modify an Agent Skill.\n\n### What it does\n\nGuides you through authoring a SKILL.md (+ optional references/, scripts/, templates/) that works across Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents supporting the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io).\n\n### Key behaviors\n\n- **Asks clarifying questions first.** Captures intent, audience, constraints, and success criteria before drafting. For ambiguous requests, it offers 2-4 targeted questions with recommended defaults.\n- **Outputs the full skill.** Delivers folder tree + complete file contents. No partial stubs.\n- **Use to update a skill as well!** If you give it feedback on how a skill could behave better (e.g. after trying out a real skill elsewhere), it'll procedurally update the skill in a conservative way to align it with what you describe as the correct behavior.\n\n### Skill structure it produces\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Main skill (frontmatter + workflow)\n├── references/           # Deep-dive docs loaded on demand\n├── scripts/              # Executable utilities\n└── templates/            # Reusable output templates\n```\n\n### Auto-improving skills\n\n```\n# Update an existing skill (preserves intent)\n/write-skill The emails being produced by 'write-email' sound too abstract for the 'b2b-, help me update the skill so that the emails don't use abstract concepts.\n\n```\n\nNote: after using a skill in an interactive session, you can invoke /write-skill at the end of the session and give it feedback how that session could have gone better.\n\n---\n\n## Using `write-agent`\n\nClaude-code specific skill that creates or updates Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`). Handles single-purpose subagents and multi-phase workflow orchestrators.\n\nUseful pattern:\n\n```bash\n/write-agent can you take skills /research-prospect and /write-email and help me write an agent that researches prospects and writes a sequenece of emails?\n```",

Override with `--test-cmd`, `--typecheck-cmd`, `--lint-cmd`. |\n| Package manager | `packageManager` field in `package.json` (falls back to npm) |\n| GitHub CLI | `gh auth status` — if missing, PR creation/review phases are skipped |\n| Browser automation | `/browser` skill availability (set up via [Quick setup](#quick-setup)) |\n\n---\n\n## Skill inventory\n\n### E2E Feature Development\n\nFrom Claude Code, run:\n\n```bash\n\\ship <feature description, bug, or improvement>\n```\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/ship` | User | End-to-end orchestrator: takes you from spec through merge-ready PR. |\n\n`ship` is the entry point for **end-to-end feature development**. It works with you to `spec` out a feature by investigating the codebase and asking you questions. **Speccing is the most important part**. It takes that spec and implements it end to end, including automated testing, PR review, and more.\n\n### Composed by /ship\n\nShip is an orchestrator that leverages these other skills:\n\n| Skill | Phase | What it does |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/spec` | 1 | Define what to build — requirements and technical design |\n| `/implement` | 2 | Write the code from the spec |\n| `/qa` | 3 | Automate \"manual\" testing of feature (e.g. Browser automation) |\n| `/pr` | After 3 | Write the PR description |\n| `/docs` | 4 | Write docs for the changes |\n| `/review` | 5 | Address review comments and get CI green |\n\nEach can be used **standalone** as well.\n\n### General Purpose\n\nThese are generally useful skills for investigating things and aiding in **decision making**.\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/research` | User or model | Deep technical research across web + OSS code bases |\n| `/explore` | User or model | Build deep understanding of a codebase area or system topic. Three lenses: surface mapping (what product/internal surfaces does this touch?), pattern inspection (what conventions exist here?), system tracing (what does this connect to and what breaks?). |\n| `/analyze` | User or model | Deeply compare pros and cons of a given decision. |\n| `/debug` | User or model | Systematic root cause investigation for code defects. Loaded by other skills (qa, implement, ship) when they hit failures. |\n\n### Browser Automation\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/browser` | User or model | Playwright automation — write and run scripts for testing, screenshots, form filling, accessibility audits, network inspection. Works in CI/Docker. |\n\n### Other\n\n| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/write-skill` | User or model | Author or update Claude Code skills (SKILL.md + supporting files) |\n| `/write-agent` | User or model | Design Claude Code agents and agent prompts (.claude/agents/*.md) |\n| `/tdd` | Model-only | Background knowledge for behavior-focused testing (auto-loaded; key principles distilled inline in spec, ship, and implement) |\n\n**Shared:** `research`, `write-skill`, `write-agent`\n\n---\n\n## Execution contexts\n\nSkills work across two execution environments. `/ship` detects the context in Phase 0 and sets the context for the run.\n\n| Context | What's available | What degrades |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Git worktree** | Same as host, isolated directory | Nothing (full capability) |\n| **Docker container** | Git, filesystem — but no gh CLI, no browser, no macOS tools | PR creation/review skipped, browser testing substituted with Bash |\n\n---\n\n## Companion plugins\n\nInstalled via [Quick setup](#quick-setup). These auto-update with their marketplace.\n\n| Plugin | What it does |\n|---|---|\n| `typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official` | Go-to-definition, find-references, and type-error checking for TypeScript/JavaScript files. |\n\n",
