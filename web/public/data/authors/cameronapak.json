I think the main culprits are awareness and education.\n\n> It doesn't matter how good your product is, because if its documentation is not good enough, people will not use it. Even if they have to use it because they have no choice, without good documentation, they won't use it effectively or the way you'd like them to.\n> \n> — [Divido.com](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/introduction)\n\nI'm going to create [skills](https://agentskills.io) that make it easier to develop with Bknd.\n\n— Cam\n\n## Get Started\n\nEasiest and best way to get started is through using Vercel's [add-skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill) package. \n\n```bash\n# Local repo installation\nnpx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-skills\n\n# Install to specific agents\nnpx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-skills -a cursor -a claude-code\n\n# Global installation\nnpx add-skill cameronapak/bknd-skills -g\n```\n\n## Attribution\n\nI've gained a lot of inspiration for these Bknd skills from [encoredev/skills](https://github.com/encoredev/skills/tree/main)\n"
