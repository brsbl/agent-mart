Recommended format:\n\n```markdown\n# Decision Log\n\n## YYYY-MM-DD: Brief Title\n\n**Context:** Why was this decision needed?\n\n**Decision:** What was decided?\n\n**Rationale:** Why this choice over alternatives?\n\n**Trade-offs:** What are the downsides?\n```\n\n## When It Triggers\n\nThe skill activates when:\n- Adding new entities or data models\n- Choosing between implementation patterns\n- Selecting libraries or approaches\n- Any non-obvious technical trade-off\n\n## Example Behavior\n\nWithout the skill:\n```\nUser: Add an ID field to User\nClaude: *adds `id: string`*\n```\n\nWith the skill:\n```\nUser: Add an ID field to User\nClaude: *checks DECISIONS.md, finds UUID requirement*\nClaude: Per DECISIONS.md (2024-11-15), using UUID for the user ID.\n*adds `id: string` with `crypto.randomUUID()`*\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
        "skills/decision-log/SKILL.md": "---\nname: decision-log\ndescription: Use when making architectural choices, adding entities, choosing patterns, or resolving non-obvious technical trade-offs in a project that may have a DECISIONS.md file\n---\n\n# Decision Log\n\nCheck `DECISIONS.md` before making architectural choices. Past decisions exist for reasons that aren't obvious from code alone.\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Before any architectural choice, check for DECISIONS.md.** This includes:\n- Adding new entities or data models\n- Choosing between implementation patterns\n- Selecting libraries or approaches\n- Any non-obvious technical trade-off\n\n## Red Flags - STOP and Check DECISIONS.md\n\n- Adding an ID field to any entity\n- Creating shared behavior (inheritance vs composition?)\n- Adding user-facing changes (feature flags?)\n- Choosing data formats, protocols, or storage\n- \"This is simple, I'll just...\"\n\n**Time pressure is not an excuse.** Urgent tasks still require checking. A wrong choice made quickly creates more work than checking first.\n\n| Rationalization | Reality |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| \"This is too small to check\" | Small choices compound. ID format affects entire codebase. |\n| \"I already know there's nothing relevant\" | You don't know what you don't know. Check anyway. |\n| \"The file probably doesn't exist\" | Takes 2 seconds to verify. Check. |\n| \"Checking will slow me down\" | Wrong choice creates more rework than checking. |\n| \"This is obvious/standard\" | Project-specific decisions override industry defaults. |\n\n## Workflow\n\n```dot\ndigraph decision_flow {\n  \"Architectural choice needed\" [shape=box];\n  \"DECISIONS.md exists?\" [shape=diamond];\n  \"Relevant precedent?\" [shape=diamond];\n  \"Apply and cite decision\" [shape=box];\n  \"Uncertain if applies?\" [shape=diamond];\n  \"Ask user\" [shape=box];\n  \"Proceed with choice\" [shape=box];\n  \"Offer to log if non-obvious\" [shape=box];\n\n  \"Architectural choice needed\" -> \"DECISIONS.md exists?\";\n  \"DECISIONS.md exists?\" -> \"Relevant precedent?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n  \"DECISIONS.md exists?\" -> \"Proceed with choice\" [label=\"no\"];\n  \"Relevant precedent?\" -> \"Apply and cite decision\" [label=\"yes\"];\n  \"Relevant precedent?\" -> \"Uncertain if applies?\" [label=\"no exact match\"];\n  \"Uncertain if applies?\" -> \"Ask user\" [label=\"yes\"];\n  \"Uncertain if applies?\" -> \"Proceed with choice\" [label=\"no\"];\n  \"Proceed with choice\" -> \"Offer to log if non-obvious\";\n}\n```\n\n## When Applying a Decision\n\nCite it explicitly:\n\n> \"Per DECISIONS.md (2024-11-15), using UUID for the product ID rather than auto-increment integer.\"\n\n## After Resolving Non-Obvious Choices\n\nIf you and the user worked through a technical trade-off, offer:\n\n> \"This decision about X might be worth logging in DECISIONS.md for future reference. Want me to add it?\"\n\n## What Belongs in DECISIONS.md\n\n- Foundational architectural choices with rationale\n- Conditional trade-offs (when X, do Y because Z)\n- Domain knowledge not obvious from code\n\n## What Doesn't Belong\n\n- Patterns already visible in existing code\n- Temporary fixes or debugging choices\n- Style preferences (put in CLAUDE.md)\n"
