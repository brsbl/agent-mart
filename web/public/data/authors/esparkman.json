Navigate to any Ruby or Rails project in Claude Code and simply ask in natural language:\n\n**Analyze entire project:**\n```\nAnalyze the code quality of this project\n```\n\n**Analyze specific paths:**\n```\nCheck the code quality of app/models\nRun code quality analysis on app/controllers/users_controller.rb\n```\n\n**Get a summary:**\n```\nGive me a quick summary of the code quality metrics\n```\n\n**Find worst files:**\n```\nShow me the 5 worst files that need refactoring\nWhat files have the lowest quality scores?\n```\n\n**Compare branches:**\n```\nCompare the code quality between this branch and main\nHow has code quality changed since the main branch?\n```\n\nClaude will automatically invoke RubyCritic and provide detailed analysis with actionable insights.\n\n## Available Capabilities\n\nThe skill provides several types of analysis you can request:\n\n| Capability | What to Ask | What You Get |\n|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Full Analysis** | \"Analyze the code quality of [path]\" | Complete breakdown of metrics, scores, and smells for files |\n| **Summary** | \"Give me a code quality summary\" | Quick overview of overall project health without file details |\n| **Worst Files** | \"Show me the worst files\" or \"Find the 5 lowest scoring files\" | Prioritized list of files needing immediate attention |\n| **Branch Comparison** | \"Compare code quality with main branch\" | Diff showing quality improvements or regressions between branches |\n\n## What Claude Can Do\n\nWhen you ask about code quality, Claude will:\n\n- Run RubyCritic analysis on your specified files or directories\n- Provide detailed metrics on complexity, duplication, and code smells\n- Explain what the scores mean and why they matter\n- Suggest specific refactorings for identified issues\n- Compare quality across branches\n- Prioritize high-impact files that need attention\n\n## Understanding the Results\n\n**Score Grades:**\n- **A (90-100)**: Excellent - minimal issues\n- **B (80-89)**: Good - minor improvements needed\n- **C (70-79)**: Fair - consider refactoring\n- **D (60-69)**: Poor - refactoring recommended\n- **F (<60)**: Critical - immediate attention required\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n- **Churn**: How frequently files change (high churn + low quality = priority)\n- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity (aim for < 10 per method)\n- **Duplication**: Code duplication percentage (aim for < 5%)\n- **Smells**: Code smell count by type (Long Method, Feature Envy, etc.)\n\n## Configuration\n\nCreate a `.rubycritic.yml` in your project root:\n\n```yaml\n# Minimum acceptable score\nminimum_score: 80.0\n\n# Paths to exclude\npaths:\n  - 'db/schema.rb'\n  - 'db/migrate/**/*'\n  - 'config/**/*'\n  - 'spec/factories/**/*'\n\n# Enable analyzers\nanalyzers:\n  - flay\n  - flog\n  - reek\n\n# Output format\nformats:\n  - console\n  - html\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Ruby 2.7 or higher\n- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- [RubyCritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic) gem\n\n## Examples\n\n### Pre-Commit Analysis\n\nBefore committing, ask Claude to check your changes:\n\n```\nAnalyze the code quality of the files I'm about to commit\n```\n\nClaude can check the staged files and provide feedback before you commit.\n\n### Focus on High-Impact Files\n\nTarget specific areas of your codebase:\n\n```\nAnalyze the code quality of app/models\n```\n\n```\nCheck the controllers for code quality issues\n```\n\n### Track Improvements\n\nMonitor quality changes over time:\n\n```\nCompare the code quality of this branch with main\n```\n\n```\nHow has the code quality of app/services/user_service.rb improved?\n```\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\nIn your CI pipeline, you can run RubyCritic directly:\n\n```bash\n# Run in CI to track quality trends\nrubycritic app/ --minimum-score 80 --format console\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Skill not appearing?**\n- Plugin install: Verify with `/plugin list`\n- Manual install: Check file is at `~/.claude/skills/rubycritic-skill/SKILL.md`\n- Restart Claude Code\n- Run `/help` to see available skills\n\n**RubyCritic not found?**\n- Install globally: `gem install rubycritic`\n- Or add to Gemfile and run `bundle install`\n\n**Analysis too slow?**\n- Narrow scope: Ask to analyze specific directories instead of entire project\n- Exclude paths in `.rubycritic.yml`\n- Run full analysis in CI/CD only\n\nSee [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for more troubleshooting tips.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
