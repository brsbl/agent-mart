across tools (Word, Confluence, PowerPoint)\n- ❌ Inconsistent governance enforcement\n- ❌ Manual vendor evaluation with bias\n- ❌ Lost traceability between requirements and design\n- ❌ Stale documentation that doesn't match reality\n\n### Solution: Structured, AI-Assisted Governance\n\nArcKit provides:\n- ✅ **Template-Driven Quality**: Comprehensive templates ensure nothing is forgotten\n- ✅ **Systematic Workflows**: Clear processes from requirements → procurement → design review\n- ✅ **AI Assistance**: Let AI handle document generation, you focus on decisions\n- ✅ **Enforced Traceability**: Automatic gap detection and coverage analysis\n- ✅ **Version Control**: Git-based workflow for all architecture artifacts\n\n---\n\n## UK Government Compliance\n\nArcKit includes dedicated commands for UK public sector delivery:\n- `/arckit.tcop` — Assess all 13 Technology Code of Practice points across delivery phases.\n- `/arckit.ai-playbook` — Produce responsible AI assessments aligned to the UK Government AI Playbook and ATRS.\n- `/arckit.secure` — Generate Secure by Design artefacts covering NCSC CAF, Cyber Essentials, and UK GDPR controls.\n-

repositories for end-to-end examples, especially `arckit-test-project-v7-nhs-appointment` (civilian services) and `arckit-test-project-v9-cabinet-office-genai` (AI governance).\n\n---\n\n## The ArcKit Workflow\n\nArcKit guides you through the enterprise architecture lifecycle:\n\n### Phase 0: Project Planning\n**`/arckit.plan`** → Create project plan with timeline, phases, and gates\n\nVisualize your entire project delivery:\n- GDS Agile Delivery phases (Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live)\n- Mermaid Gantt chart with timeline, dependencies, and milestones\n- Workflow diagram showing gates and decision points\n- Tailored timeline based on project complexity\n- Integration of all ArcKit commands into schedule\n- Gate approval criteria for governance\n\n### Phase 1: Establish Governance\n**`/arckit.principles`** → Create enterprise architecture principles\n\nDefine your organisation's architecture standards:\n- Cloud strategy (AWS/Azure/GCP)\n- Security frameworks (Zero Trust, compliance)\n- Technology standards\n- FinOps and cost governance\n\n### Phase 2: Stakeholder Analysis\n**`/arckit.stakeholders`** → Analyze stakeholder drivers, goals, and outcomes\n\n**Do this BEFORE business case** to understand who cares about the project and why:\n- Identify all stakeholders (internal and external)\n- Document underlying drivers (strategic, operational, financial, compliance, risk, personal)\n- Map drivers to SMART goals\n- Map goals to measurable outcomes\n- Create Stakeholder → Driver → Goal → Outcome traceability\n- Identify conflicts and synergies\n- Define engagement and communication strategies\n\n### Phase 3: Risk Assessment\n**`/arckit.risk`** → Create comprehensive risk register (Orange Book)\n\n**Do this BEFORE business case** to identify and assess risks systematically:\n- Follow HM Treasury Orange Book 2023 framework\n- Identify risks across 6 categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance, Reputational, Technology)\n- Assess inherent risk (before controls) and residual risk (after controls)\n- Apply 4Ts response framework (Tolerate, Treat, Transfer, Terminate)\n- Link every risk to stakeholder from RACI matrix\n- Monitor risk appetite compliance\n- Feed into SOBC Management Case Part E\n\n### Phase 4: Business Case Justification\n**`/arckit.sobc`** → Create Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC)\n\n**Do this BEFORE requirements** to justify investment and secure approval:\n- Use HM Treasury Green Book 5-case model (Strategic, Economic, Commercial, Financial, Management)\n- Analyze strategic options (Do Nothing, Minimal, Balanced, Comprehensive)\n- Map benefits to stakeholder goals (complete traceability)\n- Provide high-level cost estimates (Rough Order of Magnitude)\n- Economic appraisal (ROI range, payback period)\n- Procurement and funding strategy\n- Governance and risk management (uses risk register)\n- Enable go/no-go decision BEFORE detailed requirements work\n\n### Phase 5: Define Requirements\n**`/arckit.requirements`** → Document comprehensive requirements\n\nCreate detailed requirements **informed by stakeholder goals** (if SOBC approved):\n- Business requirements with rationale\n- Functional requirements with acceptance criteria\n- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, compliance)\n- Integration requirements (upstream/downstream systems)\n- Data requirements (DR-xxx)\n- Success criteria and KPIs\n\n### Phase 5.3: Platform Strategy Design (Optional - for Multi-Sided Platforms)\n**`/arckit.platform-design`** → Design multi-sided platform strategy using Platform Design Toolkit\n\nUse this phase when designing **ecosystem-based platforms** (Government as a Platform, marketplaces, data platforms):\n- **Ecosystem Canvas**: Map supply side, demand side, supporting entities with relationship diagrams\n- **Entity-Role Portraits**: Deep dive into 3-5 key entities (context, pressures, goals, gains)\n- **Motivations Matrix**: Identify synergies and conflicts across entities with mitigation strategies\n- **Transactions Board**: Design 10-20 transactions with cost reduction analysis (search, information, negotiation, coordination, enforcement)\n- **Learning Engine Canvas**: 5+ services that help participants improve (data, feedback loops, network effects)\n- **Platform Experience Canvas**: Journey maps with business model and unit economics\n- **MVP Canvas**: Liquidity bootstrapping strategy to solve chicken-and-egg problem\n- **Platform Design Canvas**: Synthesize all 8 canvases into cohesive platform strategy\n- **UK Government Context**: Aligns with Government as a Platform (GaaP), TCoP Point 8 (share/reuse), Digital Marketplace\n\n**Use Cases**: NHS appointment booking, local authority data marketplaces, training procurement platforms, citizen services portals\n\n### Phase 5.5: Data Modeling\n**`/arckit.data-model`** → Create comprehensive data model with ERD\n\nCreate data model based on Data Requirements (DR-xxx):\n- Visual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Mermaid\n- Detailed entity catalog with attributes, types, validation rules\n- PII identification and GDPR/DPA 2018 compliance\n- Data governance matrix (business owners, stewards, custodians)\n- CRUD matrix showing component access patterns\n- Data integration mapping (upstream sources, downstream consumers)\n- Data quality framework with measurable metrics\n- Requirements traceability (DR-xxx → Entity → Attribute)\n\n### Phase 5.7: Data Protection Impact Assessment\n**`/arckit.dpia`** → Generate [DPIA](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/) for UK GDPR Article 35 compliance\n\n**MANDATORY for high-risk processing** - assess privacy risks before technology selection:\n- ICO 9-criteria automated screening (sensitive data, large scale, vulnerable subjects, AI/ML, etc.)\n- Auto-populated from data model (entities, PII, special category data, lawful basis)\n- Risk assessment focused on impact on individuals (privacy harm, discrimination)\n- Data subject rights implementation checklist (SAR, deletion, portability)\n- Children's data assessment (age verification, parental consent)\n- AI/ML algorithmic processing assessment (bias, explainability, human oversight)\n- ICO prior consultation flagging for high residual risks\n- International transfer safeguards (SCCs, BCRs, adequacy decisions)\n- Bidirectional links to risk register (DPIA-xxx risk IDs)\n- Links mitigations to Secure by Design security controls\n\n### Phase 5.8: Data Source Discovery\n**`/arckit.datascout`** → Discover external data sources\n\nDiscover and evaluate external data

Spending Review alignment, TCoP compliance timeline, NCSC CAF progression\n\n**Use this when**: You have a multi-year transformation program with multiple initiatives running in parallel. Roadmaps are strategic (multi-year, multi-initiative, executive communication) vs project plans which are tactical (single initiative, detailed tasks, team execution).\n\n**Roadmap feeds into**: `/arckit.plan` for detailed phase execution, `/arckit.sobc` for investment business case, `/arckit.backlog` for prioritized user stories, `/arckit.strategy` for executive-level synthesis.\n\n### Phase 7.6: Architecture Strategy Synthesis\n**`/arckit.strategy`** → Synthesise strategic artifacts into executive-level Architecture Strategy\n\nCreate a comprehensive Architecture Strategy document that synthesises multiple strategic artifacts into a single coherent narrative:\n- **Strategic vision**: 2-3 paragraphs articulating the transformation vision and success definition\n- **Strategic drivers**: Summarised from stakeholder analysis with external drivers (regulatory, market, technology)\n- **Guiding principles**: Key principles with strategic implications, compliance summary\n- **Current state assessment**: Technology landscape, capability maturity baseline (L1-L5), technical debt, SWOT\n- **Target state vision**: Future architecture, capability maturity targets, architecture vision diagram\n- **Technology evolution**: Build vs buy decisions, technology radar (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold) from Wardley maps\n- **Strategic themes**: 3-5 investment themes with objectives, initiatives, success criteria, principles alignment\n- **Delivery roadmap summary**: Timeline, phases, milestones from roadmap artifact\n- **Investment summary**: CAPEX/OPEX, NPV, IRR, payback period, benefits realisation from SOBC\n- **Strategic risks**: Top risks with heat map, assumptions, constraints from risk register\n- **Success metrics**: KPIs with baselines and year-over-year targets\n- **Governance model**: Forums, decision rights, review cadence\n- **Traceability**: Driver → Goal → Outcome → Theme → Principle → KPI chain\n\n**Use this when**: You have multiple strategic artifacts (principles, stakeholders, wardley, roadmap, sobc) and need to create a single executive-level document that synthesises them into a coherent strategy. Ideal for Strategy Board presentations, executive briefings, or stakeholder communication.\n\n**Unique requirement**: This is the only ArcKit command with TWO mandatory inputs (principles AND stakeholders). Strategy cannot be created without understanding both the decision framework and the stakeholder drivers.\n\n**Strategy feeds into**: `/arckit.requirements` for detailed requirements, `/arckit.roadmap` for expanded timeline, `/arckit.plan` for project delivery.\n\n### Phase 7.7: Architecture Decision Records\n**`/arckit.adr`** → Document architectural decisions\n\nCreate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following MADR v4.0 format enhanced with UK Government requirements:\n- **Decision metadata**: Sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002), status (Proposed/Accepted/Superseded), escalation level (Team/Cross-team/Department/Cross-government)\n- **Stakeholder RACI**: Deciders (accountable), Consulted (SMEs, two-way), Informed (one-way communication)\n- **Context and problem statement**: Why this decision is needed, business/technical/regulatory drivers\n- **Decision drivers**: Technical forces (performance, security, scalability), business forces (cost, time), compliance forces (GDS Service Standard, TCoP, NCSC, UK GDPR)\n- **Options analysis**: Minimum 2-3 options plus \"Do Nothing\" baseline, each with pros/cons, cost (CAPEX/OPEX/TCO), GDS Service Standard impact, Wardley evolution stage\n- **Y-Statement**: Structured justification - \"In the context of X, facing Y, we decided for Z to achieve A, accepting B\"\n- **Consequences**: Positive (benefits, capabilities), Negative (trade-offs, technical debt), Neutral (training, infrastructure), Risks and mitigations\n- **Validation**: How implementation will be verified (design reviews, code reviews, testing, monitoring)\n- **Traceability**: Links to requirements, principles, stakeholders, research, Wardley maps, diagrams, risk register\n- **UK Government specifics**: Escalation levels (Team → Cross-team → Department → Cross-government), governance forums (ARB, TDA, Programme Board), Service Standard/TCoP compliance documentation\n\n**Use this when**: Making significant architectural decisions that affect system structure, quality attributes, or behavior - technology choices (databases, frameworks, cloud services), integration patterns, security approaches, deployment strategies, data management.\n\n**ADR feeds into**: `/arckit.diagram` (architecture diagrams reflect decisions), `/arckit.hld-review` and `/arckit.dld-review` (reviews verify decisions implemented), `/arckit.traceability` (decisions are key traceability artifacts).\n\n### Phase 8: Vendor Procurement (if needed)\n**`/arckit.sow`** → Generate Statement of Work

Install via **plugin** (`/plugin marketplace add tractorjuice/arc-kit`) |\n| [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex) | ✅ | Install via **CLI** (`arckit init --ai codex`). ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Enterprise ([Setup Guide](.codex/README.md)) |\n| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | ✅ | Install via **extension** (`gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`) |\n\nClaude Code uses the **ArcKit plugin** (not the CLI). The plugin provides slash commands, autonomous agents for research-heavy tasks, bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge + Microsoft Learn), and automatic updates via the marketplace. Gemini CLI uses the **ArcKit extension** for the same zero-config experience. Codex CLI uses the CLI package which copies commands and templates into the project directory.\n\n### Why Commands, Not Skills\n\nClaude Code automatically exposes ArcKit commands as **skills** (they appear in the skills list and can be matched by natural language). ArcKit intentionally uses **slash commands** rather than standalone skills because:\n\n- **Deliberate invocation required** — Every command generates a heavyweight governance document (requirements spec, risk register, DPIA, etc.). Auto-triggering from conversational intent would waste significant time and tokens.\n- **Dependency ordering** — Commands follow a deliberate sequence (principles → stakeholders → requirements → data-model → etc.). Skills that auto-trigger could run out of order.\n- **User input via `$ARGUMENTS`** — Most commands accept context from the user (project name, scope, constraints). The command system handles this with `$ARGUMENTS` substitution.\n- **Best of both worlds** — Since Claude Code exposes commands as skills automatically, users get explicit `/arckit.requirements` invocation AND natural language matching when Claude recognises intent — no restructuring needed.\n\n### Using with Codex CLI\n\nFor OpenAI Codex CLI users, commands use the `/prompts:` format:\n\n```bash\n# Set CODEX_HOME to use project-specific commands\nexport CODEX_HOME=\"$(pwd)/.codex\"\ncodex --auto\n\n# Then use ArcKit commands\n/prompts:arckit.principles Create principles for financial services\n/prompts:arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for cloud migration\n/prompts:arckit.requirements Create comprehensive requirements\n```\n\nSee [.codex/README.md](.codex/README.md) for full Codex CLI setup and usage.\n\n\n## Project Structure\n\nArcKit creates this structure:\n\n```\npayment-modernization/\n├── .arckit/\n│   ├── scripts/\n│

defaults:\n\n```bash\n# Inside your AI assistant\n/arckit.customize requirements   # Copy requirements template for editing\n/arckit.customize all            # Copy all templates\n/arckit.customize list           # See available templates\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- Default templates live in `.arckit/templates/` (refreshed by `arckit init`)\n- Your customizations go in `.arckit/templates-custom/` (preserved across updates)\n- Commands automatically check for custom templates first, falling back to defaults\n\n**Common customizations:**\n- Add organization-specific document control fields\n- Include mandatory compliance sections (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS)\n- Add department-specific approval workflows\n- Customize UK Government classification banners\n\n---\n\n## Complete Command Reference\n\nAll 48 ArcKit commands with maturity status and example outputs from public test repositories (20 test repos, v0–v19).\n\n### Status Legend\n\n| Status | Description

for Strategic Architecture\n\nArcKit uses Wardley Maps to expose the strategic position of every component before you commit to a solution. The `/arckit.wardley` command produces ready-to-visualise maps that:\n- Trace user needs through the supporting value chain so gaps and duplicated effort are obvious.\n- Plot evolution from Genesis → Commodity to reveal when to build, buy, reuse, or retire capabilities.\n- Feed procurement, vendor evaluation, and design reviews with shared situational awareness.\n\nMaps are emitted in the Open Wardley Map format — paste them straight into [https://create.wardleymaps.ai](https://create.wardleymaps.ai) for a visual view. Full example outputs live in the public demos such as `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11` (enterprise OS rollout strategy) and `arckit-test-project-v14-scottish-courts` (GenAI platform strategy).\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid\n\n**ArcKit generates visual architecture diagrams using Mermaid for clear technical communication.**\n\n### What are Architecture Diagrams?\n\nArchitecture diagrams visualize system structure, interactions, and deployment for:\n- **Technical Communication**: Share architecture with stakeholders\n- **Design Documentation**: Document current and future state\n- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor technical approaches\n- **UK Government Compliance**: Visualize Cloud First, GOV.UK services, PII handling\n\n### Diagram Types\n\nArcKit supports 6 essential diagram types based on the C4 Model and enterprise architecture best practices:\n\n| Diagram Type | Level | Purpose | When to Use |\n|--------------|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **C4 Context** | Level 1 | System in context with users and external systems | After requirements, to show system boundaries |\n| **C4 Container** | Level 2 | Technical containers and technology choices | After HLD, for vendor review |\n| **C4 Component** | Level 3 | Internal components within a container | After DLD, for implementation |\n| **Deployment** | Infrastructure | Cloud resources and network topology | Cloud First compliance, cost estimation |\n| **Sequence** | Interaction | API flows and request/response patterns | Integration requirements, API design |\n| **Data Flow** | Data | How data moves, PII handling, GDPR compliance | UK GDPR, DPIA requirements |\n\nUse `/arckit.diagram` directly, or supply an explicit type such as `context`, `container`, `sequence`, or `dataflow`. Outputs bundle component inventories with Wardley evolution tags, built-in GOV.UK compliance scaffolding (Notify, Pay, Design System), Cloud First network patterns, GDPR annotations, and traceability back to requirements and tests. For full examples, browse the diagram folders in `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11` and `arckit-test-project-v14-scottish-courts`.\n\n## ServiceNow Service Management Design\n\nArcKit turns architecture artefacts into an operations-ready ServiceNow pack. The `/arckit.servicenow` command builds:\n- CMDB hierarchies, SLAs, and change risk straight from requirements, diagrams, and Wardley Maps.\n- ITIL-aligned runbooks covering incident, change, monitoring, and transition activities.\n- UK government extras such as GDS Service Standard, Technology Code of Practice, and GOV.UK Pay/Notify dependencies when relevant.\n\nFor full outputs, explore the public demos (for example `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11`) where the generated ServiceNow design files and checklists are published end-to-end.\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nKey references live in `docs/` and top-level guides:\n- Quick tour: [docs/index.html](docs/index.html) mirrors the public landing page.\n- Lifecycle visuals: [WORKFLOW-DIAGRAMS.md](WORKFLOW-DIAGRAMS.md) and [DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md](DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md) cover command flow and relationships.\n- Core guides: [docs/guides/principles.md](docs/guides/principles.md), [docs/guides/requirements.md](docs/guides/requirements.md), [docs/guides/procurement.md](docs/guides/procurement.md), [docs/guides/design-review.md](docs/guides/design-review.md).\n- Traceability: [docs/guides/traceability.md](docs/guides/traceability.md) documents end-to-end coverage patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison to Other Tools\n\n| Feature | ArcKit | Sparx EA | Ardoq | LeanIX | Confluence |\n|---------|--------|----------|-------|--------|------------|\n| **AI-Assisted** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Wardley Mapping** | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Version Control** | ✅ Git | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited |\n| **Vendor RFP** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Manual |\n| **Design Review Gates** | ✅ | ⚠️ Manual | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Manual |\n| **Traceability** | ✅ Automated | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ |\n| **Cost** | Free | $$$$ | $$$$ | $$$$ | $$ |\n| **Learning Curve** | Low | High | Medium | Medium | Low |\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Python 3.11+**\n- **Git** (optional but recommended)\n- **AI Coding Agent**: [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) (via plugin), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (via extension), or [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex) (via CLI)\n- **uv** for package management: [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)\n\n---\n\n## Installation from Source\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git\ncd arc-kit\n\n# Install in development mode\npip install -e .\n\n# Run the CLI\narckit init my-project\n```\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull guidance lives in `docs/` and the static site.\n- Quick tour: [docs/index.html](docs/index.html) (mirrors the public landing page).\n- Core guides: [docs/guides/principles.md](docs/guides/principles.md), [docs/guides/requirements.md](docs/guides/requirements.md), [docs/guides/procurement.md](docs/guides/procurement.md), [docs/guides/design-review.md](docs/guides/design-review.md).\n- Reference packs: [WORKFLOW-DIAGRAMS.md](WORKFLOW-DIAGRAMS.md) and [DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md](DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md) cover lifecycle visualisations and the 48×48 command matrix.\n- Traceability: [docs/guides/traceability.md](docs/guides/traceability.md) documents end-to-end requirements coverage.\n\n## Relationship to Spec Kit\n\nArcKit is inspired by [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) but targets a different audience:\n\n| | Spec Kit | ArcKit |\n|---|----------|--------|\n| **Audience** | Product Managers, Developers | Enterprise Architects, Procurement |\n| **Focus** | Feature development (0→1 code generation) | Architecture governance & vendor management |\n| **Workflow** | Spec → Plan → Tasks → Code | Requirements → RFP → Design Review → Traceability |\n| **Output** | Working code | Architecture documentation & governance |\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

        "arckit-plugin/README.md": "# ArcKit Plugin for Claude Code\n\nEnterprise Architecture Governance & Vendor Procurement Toolkit - a Claude Code plugin providing 45 slash commands for generating architecture artifacts.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Step 1: Add the marketplace\n\nIn Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add tractorjuice/arc-kit\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install the plugin\n\n```\n/plugin\n```\n\nGo to the **Discover** tab, find **arckit**, and install it. Or via CLI:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install arckit@arc-kit\n```\n\n### Alternative: Load for a single session\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/arc-kit/arckit-plugin\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Claude Code** v1.0.0 or later\n- **Bash** shell (for helper scripts)\n- For `/arckit:aws-research`: AWS Knowledge MCP server (included)\n- For `/arckit:azure-research`: Microsoft Learn MCP server (install separately)\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAfter installing the plugin:\n\n1. **Initialize a project** (optional - commands will create structure automatically):\n   ```\n   /arckit:init\n   ```\n\n2. **Create architecture principles**:\n   ```\n   /arckit:principles\n   ```\n\n3. **Create requirements for a project**:\n   ```\n   /arckit:requirements NHS appointment booking system\n   ```\n\n## What's Included\n\n| Component | Count | Description |\n|-----------|-------|-------------|\n| Commands | 48 | Slash commands for architecture artifacts |\n| Skills | 1 | Conversational Wardley Mapping with interactive guidance |\n| Agents | 5 | Autonomous research agents |\n| Templates | 45 | Document templates with UK Government compliance |\n| Scripts | 6 | Helper bash scripts |\n| Guides | 51 | Command usage documentation |\n\n## Template Customization\n\nArcKit templates can be customized per-project to match your organization's requirements, branding, or compliance frameworks.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **User templates override plugin templates**: If a template exists in `.arckit/templates/`, it takes precedence over the plugin's default template.\n\n2. **Copy and customize**: Use `/arckit:customize` to copy templates to your project for editing.\n\n### Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# List available templates\n/arckit:customize list\n\n# Copy a template to customize\n/arckit:customize requirements\n\n# Copy all templates\n/arckit:customize all\n```\n\n### Common Customizations\n\n**For non-UK Government projects:**\n- Remove \"UK Government Alignment\" sections\n- Change classification scheme from OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE to your organization's scheme\n- Remove TCoP, GDS Service Standard references\n\n**For your organization:**\n- Add custom Document Control fields (Cost Centre, Programme, Department)\n- Change requirement ID prefixes (BR/FR/NFR → your taxonomy)\n- Add organization branding and headers\n- Modify compliance frameworks (ISO27001, SOX, HIPAA instead of UK Gov)\n\n### Template Location\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── .arckit/\n│   └── templates/              # Your customized templates\n│       ├── requirements-template.md\n│       ├── risk-register-template.md\n│       └── ...\n└── projects/\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### Keeping Templates Updated\n\nWhen ArcKit plugin updates with new features:\n- Your customized templates are **not** automatically updated\n- Compare your templates with plugin versions periodically\n- Merge new sections you want to adopt\n\n## Skills\n\nThe plugin includes conversational skills that activate automatically when you ask relevant questions:\n\n- **Wardley Mapping** — Ask about evolution stages, doctrine maturity, build vs. buy decisions, gameplay patterns, or create interactive maps. For formal documents, use `/arckit:wardley` instead.\n\n## Commands Overview\n\n### Core Governance\n- `/arckit:principles` - Create architecture principles\n- `/arckit:stakeholders` - Analyze stakeholders and goals\n- `/arckit:requirements` - Generate comprehensive requirements\n- `/arckit:risk` - Create risk register (Orange Book)\n- `/arckit:sobc` - Strategic Outline Business Case (Green Book)\n\n### Technical Design\n- `/arckit:data-model` - Data model with GDPR compliance\n- `/arckit:diagram` - Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)\n- `/arckit:wardley` - Wardley Maps for strategy\n- `/arckit:adr` - Architecture Decision Records\n\n### Research & Procurement\n- `/arckit:research` - Technology market research\n- `/arckit:aws-research` - AWS service research (MCP)\n- `/arckit:azure-research` - Azure service research (MCP)\n- `/arckit:datascout` - External data source discovery\n- `/arckit:evaluate` - Vendor evaluation framework\n- `/arckit:sow` - Statement of Work / RFP\n- `/arckit:gcloud-search` - G-Cloud marketplace search\n- `/arckit:dos` - Digital Outcomes & Specialists\n\n### UK Government Compliance\n- `/arckit:tcop` - Technology Code of Practice review\n- `/arckit:secure` - Secure by Design assessment\n- `/arckit:dpia` - Data Protection Impact Assessment\n- `/arckit:ai-playbook` - AI Playbook compliance\n- `/arckit:service-assessment` - GDS Service Standard\n\n### Operations & Delivery\n- `/arckit:devops` - DevOps strategy\n- `/arckit:finops` - FinOps cloud cost management\n- `/arckit:mlops` - MLOps strategy\n- `/arckit:operationalize` - Operational readiness\n- `/arckit:backlog` - Product backlog generation\n- `/arckit:roadmap` - Architecture roadmap\n\nSee the full command list with `/help arckit`.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nArcKit creates this structure in your project:\n\n```\nprojects/\n├── 000-global/           # Cross-project artifacts\n│   ├── policies/         # Organization policies\n│   └── ARC-000-PRIN-*.md # Architecture principles\n└── 001-project-name/     # Project artifacts\n    ├── ARC-001-REQ-*.md  # Requirements\n    ├── ARC-001-STKE-*.md # Stakeholders\n    ├── vendors/          # Vendor evaluations\n    └── external/         # External documents\n```\n\n## MCP Servers\n\nThe plugin includes configuration for:\n- **AWS Knowledge MCP** - Official AWS documentation for `/arckit:aws-research`\n- **Microsoft Learn MCP** - Official Azure documentation for `/arckit:azure-research`\n\n## Migration from CLI\n\nIf you previously used `arckit init --ai claude`:\n\n```bash\n# Remove CLI-generated files (plugin replaces them)\nrm -rf .claude/commands/arckit.*.md\nrm -rf .claude/agents/arckit-*.md\nrm -rf .arckit/templates/\nrm -rf .arckit/scripts/\n\n# Keep your project data\n# projects/ directory stays (user data)\n```\n\n> **Note:** The ArcKit CLI no longer distributes Claude Code commands. Claude Code users should use this plugin instead.\n\n## For Gemini/Codex Users\n\nThis plugin is for Claude Code. For other AI assistants:\n\n- **Gemini CLI**: Install the [ArcKit Gemini extension](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini) (`gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini`)\n- **Codex CLI**: Install the ArcKit CLI (`pip install arckit-cli && arckit init --ai codex`)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Repository](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit)\n- [Documentation](https://tractorjuice.github.io/arc-kit)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
