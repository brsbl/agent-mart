        "README.md": "# claude-code-flow\n\nA Claude Code plugin providing developer workflow utilities to keep in the flow.\n\n## Skills\n\n| Skill | Command | Description |\n| ----- | ------- | ----------- |\n| **pr** | `/flow:pr` | Create a pull request with auto-generated title and body from branch context |\n| **pr-desc** | `/flow:pr-desc` | Update an existing PR's description from current branch context |\n| **pr-title** | `/flow:pr-title` | Update an existing PR's title from current branch context |\n| **create-git-worktree** | `/flow:create-git-worktree` | Create an isolated git worktree with config syncing and post-create hooks |\n\n## Installation\n\n### From marketplace\n\n```\nclaude plugin install claude-code-flow\n```\n\n### Local development\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/salimhamed/claude-code-flow.git\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-code-flow\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a PR\n\n```\n/flow:pr\n```\n\nGathers branch context (commits, diff, changed files), generates a title and body, then creates the PR via `gh pr create`. Refuses if on the base branch, no commits exist, or a PR already exists.\n\n### Update PR description\n\n```\n/flow:pr-desc\n```\n\nUpdates the body of an existing PR based on the current branch context. Accepts optional instructions:\n\n```\n/flow:pr-desc include a ## Usage section showing how to use each skill\n```\n\n### Update PR title\n\n```\n/flow:pr-title\n```\n\nUpdates the title of an existing PR based on current branch context.\n\n### Create a git worktree\n\n```\n/flow:create-git-worktree feature-branch\n```\n\nCreates an isolated git worktree in a sibling directory. Handles branch verification, freshness checks against origin, config file syncing (via `.worktreerc.yml`), and post-create hooks.\n\n#### Configuring worktrees\n\nAdd an optional `.worktreerc.yaml` file to your repo root to control file syncing and post-create hooks:\n\n```yaml\nworktree:\n  # Glob patterns matched against the main worktree root.\n  # Matched files are copied into new worktrees (existing files are not overwritten).\n  copy:\n    - .env\n    - .env.local\n    - .direnv\n\n  # Shell commands run sequentially in the new worktree directory.\n  # Stops on first failure.\n  post_create:\n    - uv sync\n    - pre-commit install\n```\n\nBoth sections are optional. Omit either one and it becomes a no-op.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Git** — all skills\n- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — PR skills (`pr`, `pr-desc`, `pr-title`)\n- **`uv`** — worktree skill (`create-git-worktree`)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
