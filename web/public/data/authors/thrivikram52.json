        "README.md": "# QuickLearn\n\nRapidly master any technical concept through progressive complexity — from intuition to implementation.\n\nA Claude Code plugin that generates structured learning paths with markdown notes, Mermaid diagrams, runnable Python code, quizzes, and flashcards. Designed for learners and educators (especially for IIT-level teaching).\n\n## Features\n\n- **7-Level Progressive Learning**: Intuition → Overview → Walkthrough → Math → Code (High-Level) → Code (From Scratch) → Teaching Notes\n- **Separate Outputs**: `.md` files for study, `.py` files for code — clean and organized\n- **Research-Backed Techniques**: Feynman Method, Spiral Learning, Analogy Bridges, Active Recall\n- **Web-Enhanced**: Uses web search to enrich content with latest papers and resources\n- **Teaching Materials**: Lecture plans, assignments, assessments designed for IIT students\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin add https://github.com/thrivikram52/QuickLearn\n```\n\nOr install locally for development:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/thrivikram52/QuickLearn.git\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/QuickLearn\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/quicklearn <concept>` | Generate full 7-level learning path with code |\n| `/quicklearn:deep-dive <sub-topic>` | Drill deeper into a specific sub-topic |\n| `/quicklearn:teach <concept>` | Generate IIT-student-ready teaching materials |\n| `/quicklearn:quiz <concept>` | Generate active recall quiz (21 questions, 7 levels) |\n| `/quicklearn:flashcards <concept>` | Generate 30-40 flashcards for spaced repetition |\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```\n/quicklearn auto-encoders\n```\n\nThis generates:\n\n```\nquicklearn/auto-encoders/\n├── 01-intuition.md          # Why auto-encoders exist (analogy-driven)\n├── 02-overview.md           # Architecture diagrams and component breakdown\n├── 03-walkthrough.md        # Step-by-step with concrete numbers\n├── 04-math.md               # Loss functions, derivations, formal notation\n├── 05-code-highlevel.md     # PyTorch implementation explained\n├── 06-code-from-scratch.md  # NumPy implementation explained\n├── 07-teach-notes.md        # Lecture plan, misconceptions, exam questions\n└── code/\n    ├── 01_autoencoder_highlevel.py\n    ├── 02_autoencoder_from_scratch.py\n    └── 03_variational_ae.py\n```\n\nThen deepen your understanding:\n\n```\n/quicklearn:deep-dive KL divergence in VAEs\n/quicklearn:quiz auto-encoders\n/quicklearn:flashcards auto-encoders\n/quicklearn:teach auto-encoders\n```\n\n## Learning Methodology\n\nQuickLearn applies proven learning techniques at every level:\n\n| Technique | Application |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Feynman Method** | Level 1 — explain simply, find gaps, add complexity |\n| **Spiral Learning** | All levels — revisit concepts at increasing depth |\n| **Analogy Bridges** | Levels 1,3 — connect new ideas to known concepts |\n| **Visual Thinking** | All levels — Mermaid diagrams throughout |\n| **Active Recall** | Every level ends with checkpoint questions |\n| **Concrete Before Abstract** | Levels 3,5,6 — examples before generalization |\n\n## Progressive Complexity\n\nThe philosophy: **breadth first, then depth**.\n\n1. **Use existing tools first** — Level 5 builds with PyTorch/sklearn\n2. **Then build from scratch** — Level 6 rebuilds with only NumPy\n3. **Then teach others** — Level 7 synthesizes into teaching materials\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Claude Code CLI\n- Python 3.8+ (for running generated code)\n- Common ML libraries: `pip install torch numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`\n\n## Author\n\n**Thrivikram** — [GitHub](https://github.com/thrivikram52)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
