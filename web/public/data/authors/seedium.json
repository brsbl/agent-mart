Add the marketplace\n\n```shell\n/plugin marketplace add seedium/skills\n```\n\n### 2. Install a plugin\n\n```shell\n/plugin install engineering@seedium\n```\n\n### 3. Use a skill\n\n```shell\n/create-commit\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|---|---|\n| [engineering](plugins/engineering) | Engineering workflow skills (commit automation, and more to come) |\n\n## Contributing\n\nEach plugin lives under `plugins/<name>/` and follows the [Claude Code plugin structure](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins):\n\n```\nplugins/<name>/\n  .claude-plugin/\n    plugin.json\n  skills/\n    <skill-name>/\n      SKILL.md\n```\n\nTo add a new skill to an existing plugin, create a directory under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file.

        "plugins/engineering/README.md": "# Engineering Plugin\n\nEngineering workflow skills for Claude Code.\n\n## Skills\n\n### `/create-commit`\n\nCreates a conventional commit from staged changes. Analyzes your diff, determines the commit type and scope, composes a message, and handles the full commit flow.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. Reads staged changes and current branch\n2. Guards against accidental commits to `main`/`master` (offers to create a branch)\n3. Picks the commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.) and scope based on the diff\n4. Presents the commit message for your approval\n5. Runs `git commit` and auto-fixes pre-commit hook failures\n6. Optionally pushes and creates a PR via `gh`\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```shell\ngit add <files>\n/create-commit\n```\n"
