        "README.md": "# Storm Claude Marketplace\n\nA curated collection of Claude Code plugins, featuring the **Product Management Toolkit** - a suite of plugins that help you go from idea to implementation with structured product development practices.\n\n## Product Management Toolkit\n\nBuild products systematically with Claude as your PM partner. The toolkit guides you through the entire product development lifecycle:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Strategy [\"Strategy & Foundation\"]\n        V[\"/vision\"]\n        A[\"/architecture\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Understanding [\"Domain Understanding\"]\n        D[\"/domain\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Planning [\"What to Build\"]\n        B[\"/backlog\"]\n        R[\"/requirements\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Execution [\"Building It\"]\n        P[\"/plan\"]\n        E[\"/execute\"]\n    end\n\n    V --> B\n    A --> P\n    D --> R\n    B --> P\n    R --> P\n    P --> E\n```\n\n### The Workflow\n\n**1. Start with Strategy**\n\n- `/vision` - Define who you're building for and why it matters\n- `/architecture` - Document your tech stack and key decisions (ADRs)\n\n**2. Understand Your Domain**\n\n- `/domain` - Capture domain knowledge: entities, processes, and glossary terms\n\n**3. Decide What to Build**\n\n- `/backlog` - Manage your product backlog as an ordered priority list\n- `/requirements` - Write BDD requirements in Gherkin (Given-When-Then)\n\n**4. Plan and Execute**\n\n- `/plan` - Create implementation plans from backlog items\n- `/execute` - Implement the plan step by step\n\n### How Things Connect\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Inputs\n        DK[\"Domain Knowledge\"]\n        BL[\"Backlog Item\"]\n        REQ[\"Requirements\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Output\n        PLAN[\"Implementation Plan\"]\n    end\n\n    DK -->|informs| REQ\n    REQ -->|linked to| BL\n    BL -->|becomes| PLAN\n    REQ -->|acceptance criteria| PLAN\n```\n\n- **Domain Knowledge** helps you write accurate requirements (you understand the entities and rules)\n- **Requirements** get linked to **Backlog Items** (what work implements what requirement)\n- **Planning** pulls from both - the backlog item tells you *what* to build, requirements tell you *how it should behave*\n\n### Domain Model\n\nThe toolkit uses a structured hierarchy for organizing domain knowledge and requirements:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph \"Domain Knowledge\"\n        DOM[Domain]\n        SUB[Subdomain]\n        ENT[Entity]\n        PROC[Process]\n        GLOSS[Glossary]\n\n        DOM --> SUB\n        SUB --> ENT\n        SUB --> PROC\n        SUB --> GLOSS\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Requirements\"\n        DOM2[Domain]\n        SUB2[\"Subdomain (3-letter prefix)\"]\n        CAP[\"Capability (3-letter prefix)\"]\n        REQ2[\"Requirement (ID: DOM-SUB-CAP-NNN)\"]\n\n        DOM2 --> SUB2\n        SUB2 --> CAP\n        CAP --> REQ2\n    end\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nDomain: Admission\n└── Subdomain: Admission Rules (ADM)\n    └── Capability: Grade Calculation (GRD)\n        └── Requirement: ADM-GRD-001 - Calculate weighted average\n```\n\n### File Structure\n```\nyour-project/\n└── docs/\n    ├── strategy/\n    │   ├── vision.md\n    │   ├── tech-stack.md\n    │   ├── backlog.md\n    │   └── architecture/\n    │       └── 001-use-postgres.md\n    ├── domains/\n    │   └── admission/\n    │       └── admission-rules/\n    │           ├── entities/\n    │           ├── processes/\n    │           └── glossary/\n    ├── requirements/\n    │   ├── registry.md\n    │   └── admission/\n    │       └── admission-rules/\n    │           └── grade-calculation/\n    │               └── weighted-average.feature\n    └── plans/\n        └── user-registration.md\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Add the Marketplace\n\nIn Claude Code, run:\n\n```\n/plugins\n```\n\nSelect \"New marketplace\", then paste:\n\n```\ngit@github.com:SmidigStorm/storm-claude-marketplace.git\n```\n\n### Option 2: Command Line\n\n```bash\nclaude /plugin marketplace add SmidigStorm/storm-claude-marketplace\n```\n\n### Browse and Install Plugins\n\nAfter adding the marketplace:\n\n```bash\n/plugins\n```\n\nInstall a specific plugin:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install pm-vision@storm-claude-marketplace\n```\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n### Product Management Toolkit\n\n| Plugin | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| [pm-vision](./plugins/pm-vision) | Create and maintain product vision documentation |\n| [pm-architecture](./plugins/pm-architecture) | Manage tech stack and architecture decisions (ADRs) |\n| [pm-domain-knowledge](./plugins/pm-domain-knowledge) | Document domain entities, processes, and glossary |\n| [pm-prioritization](./plugins/pm-prioritization) | Manage product backlog as an ordered priority list |\n| [pm-requirements](./plugins/pm-requirements) | BDD requirements with Gherkin feature files |\n| [pm-planning](./plugins/pm-planning) | Create and execute implementation plans |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Starting a new project?** Run these in order:\n\n1. `/vision` - Define your product vision\n2. `/architecture` - Document initial tech decisions\n3. `/domain` - Start capturing domain knowledge as you learn\n4. `/backlog` - Add your first features\n5. `/requirements` - Write requirements for a backlog item\n6. `/plan` - Plan the implementation\n7. `/execute` - Build it!\n\n**Joining an existing project?** Start with `/domain` to explore what's documented, then pick up wherever the team is in the workflow.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

        "plugins/pm-planning/README.md": "# PM Planning\n\nCreate implementation plans from backlog items and execute them with confidence. This plugin uses specialized agents for thorough codebase exploration, architecture design, and code review.\n\n## Commands\n\n### `/plan [backlog item]`\n\nCreates an implementation plan through a guided 6-phase process:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    D[Discovery] --> R[Requirements]\n    R --> E[Explore]\n    E --> Q[Questions]\n    Q --> A[Architecture]\n    A --> Doc[Document]\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/plan Add user authentication with OAuth\n```\n\n### `/execute [plan-name]`\n\nExecutes a plan from `docs/plans/` with built-in code review:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    L[Load] --> C[Check]\n    C --> I[Implement]\n    I --> R[Review]\n    R --> V[Verify]\n    V --> Done[Complete]\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\n/execute user-authentication\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Planning Phase\n\n1. **Discovery** - Understand what needs to be built\n2. **Requirements Mapping** - Link to existing requirements (DOM-SUB-CAP-NNN format)\n3. **Codebase Exploration** - Launch `code-explorer` agents to understand patterns\n4. **Clarifying Questions** - Resolve all ambiguities before designing\n5. **Architecture Design** - Launch `code-architect` agents to propose approaches\n6. **Document Plan** - Create plan file in `docs/plans/`\n\n### Execution Phase\n\n1. **Load Plan** - Read and summarize the plan\n2. **Pre-Implementation Check** - Verify codebase matches assumptions\n3. **Implementation** - Execute steps autonomously (stops on roadblocks)\n4. **Quality Review** - Launch `code-reviewer` agents to catch issues\n5. **Verification** - Check acceptance criteria\n6. **Completion** - Update plan, offer to commit\n\n## Agents\n\nThe plugin includes three specialized agents:\n\n| Agent | Purpose | Used In |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| `code-explorer` | Traces execution paths, maps architecture, identifies patterns | `/plan` Phase 3 |\n| `code-architect` | Designs implementation approaches with trade-offs | `/plan` Phase 5 |\n| `code-reviewer` | Reviews for bugs, quality, and conventions | `/execute` Phase 4 |\n\n### Using Agents Manually\n\nYou can also invoke agents directly:\n\n```\n\"Launch code-explorer to trace how the payment system works\"\n```\n\n```\n\"Launch code-architect to design a caching layer\"\n```\n\n```\n\"Launch code-reviewer to check my recent changes\"\n```\n\n## Output\n\nPlans are saved to `docs/plans/[name].md` with:\n\n- Summary of what's being built\n- Requirements being implemented (with IDs)\n- Architecture approach chosen\n- Codebase patterns to follow\n- Step-by-step implementation guide\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Decisions made with rationale\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```\n# 1. Create a plan\n/plan Add rate limiting to API endpoints\n\n# Claude will:\n# - Ask clarifying questions about requirements\n# - Launch explorers to understand the codebase\n# - Present architecture options\n# - Create docs/plans/rate-limiting.md\n\n# 2. Review the plan (it's just a markdown file)\ncat docs/plans/rate-limiting.md\n\n# 3. Execute when ready\n/execute rate-limiting\n\n# Claude will:\n# - Implement each step\n# - Run code review\n# - Verify acceptance criteria\n# - Offer to commit\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Be specific** in your initial request to reduce clarifying questions\n- **Review the plan** before executing - it's a checkpoint\n- **Trust the agents** - they explore thoroughly so you don't have to\n- **Don't skip code review** - it catches real issues\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use `/plan` for:**\n- Features touching multiple files\n- Work requiring architectural decisions\n- Complex integrations\n- Unclear requirements that need exploration\n\n**Skip planning for:**\n- Single-line fixes\n- Well-defined simple tasks\n- Urgent hotfixes\n",
