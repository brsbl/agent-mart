available plugins\n/plugin list\n\n# Install the plugin\n/plugin install zeff-claude-setup\n```\n\n### Method 3: Manual Clone\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository to your Claude plugins directory\ngit clone https://github.com/Zeff01/zeff-claude-setup.git ~/.claude/plugins/zeff-claude-setup\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, verify the plugin is installed:\n\n```bash\n/plugin list\n```\n\nThe agents will be automatically available in Claude Code and activate based on your task context.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Mobile Development\n```\nUser: \"I need to build a React Native app with offline-first architecture\"\n→ mobile-architect agent activates\n→ Provides guidance on React Native, local storage, sync strategies\n```\n\n### Backend API Design\n```\nUser: \"Design a REST API for user authentication with rate limiting\"\n→ backend-architect agent activates\n→ Provides API specs, security patterns, rate limiting implementation\n```\n\n### Performance Optimization\n```\nUser: \"My React app is slow, help me optimize it\"\n→ performance-engineer agent activates\n→ Profiles app, identifies bottlenecks, provides optimization strategies\n```\n\n### Security Review\n```\nUser: \"Review this authentication code for security issues\"\n→ security-engineer agent activates\n→ Performs vulnerability assessment, provides remediation guidance\n```\n\n##
