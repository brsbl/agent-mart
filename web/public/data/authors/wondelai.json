Christensen co-founded Innosight (growth strategy consultancy), Rose Park Advisors (investment firm), and the Christensen Institute (non-profit think tank). His JTBD framework, detailed in [*\"Competing Against Luck\"*](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612?tag=wondelai00-20), has been adopted by companies like Netflix, Intuit, and countless startups worldwide.\n\n**Use when you need to:**\n- Understand why customers really buy (or don't buy) your product\n- Design a new product or feature from scratch\n- Write customer discovery interview questions\n- Analyze competition beyond obvious product categories\n- Diagnose why a product isn't selling or customers are churning\n- Create positioning and messaging strategy\n- Reframe product metrics around customer progress\n\n**Example prompts:**\n- *\"Help me write interview questions to discover the job our customers hire our app for.

Their client list includes Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, and many other leading tech companies. Their methodology has generated billions in additional revenue. [*\"Making Websites Win\"*](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Websites-Win-Customer-Centric-Methodology/dp/1544500513?tag=wondelai00-20) became an Amazon #1 bestseller in 15 categories.
