Now it needs management.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  Claude Code isn't just a tool. It's your personal employee.<br>\n  A brilliant, tireless, and - more often than not - occasionally chaotic employee.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <em>Compliance Officer. Accountant. Project Manager. Receptionist. Mentor. Librarian. Taskmaster.<br>\n  These plugins handle most of that - so you can focus on building.</em>\n</p>\n\n## Why?\n\nYou asked Claude to commit your changes. He force-pushed to main. On Friday. At 5pm.\n\nYou ran out of API tokens mid-task. No warning. Context gone.\n\nMain agent working hard but starts degrading after 50% context window? Hooks with subagents and Hydra with parallel work save your day.\n\nYou needed parallel work. Git conflicts everywhere.\n\nYou left Claude alone for 5 minutes. He's been \"thinking\" ever since - and you only know if you check yourself (Schroedinger's Claude).\n\nClaude is brilliant. Claude is also a golden retriever with a keyboard - enthusiastic, helpful, and completely unsupervised with root access.\n\n**These plugins add the leash.**\n\n(Yes, I know full well you're all bypassing permissions because it's FAST. But you should at least put in SOME form of guardrails and check in occasionally to guarantee quality - not just blindly let it run and hope for the best, only to end up with buggy or even insecure AI slop.)\n\nWithout guardrails:\n- Context dies mid-task? Start over.\n- API limit hit? Surprise!\n- Need parallel work? Git conflicts incoming.\n- Was that commit good? Who knows, Claude already pushed.\n\n## The Solution\n\nA growing collection of plugins, continuously developed to meet my extremely high expectations for AI-assisted development.\n\nBorn from real pain points. Built for developers who learned the hard way - since Claude Code exists.\n\n**Each plugin works independently - pick what you need. But together, they form a solid framework for developers who want control, quality, and security over pure YOLO mode.**\n\nThey don't replace Claude. They make Claude manageable.\n\n| Plugin | Role | What they do |\n|--------|------|--------------|\n| [**dogma**](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace/wiki/Claude-Code-Dogma-Plugin) | The Compliance Officer | Flexible rule sync from any source, with enforcement hooks.

These are patterns refined through daily use - a belief system for productive development.\n\nInstead of wandering in darkness, follow the proven path:\n- Project setup (greenfield and brownfield)\n- Plugin integration\n- Parallel development with hydra\n- Code quality automation\n- And more\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis plugin represents the preacher's continuously refined approach. It's opinionated by design - not trying to cover every possible workflow, but providing clear guidance for what works.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd to your marketplace or copy to `.claude-plugin/`.\n",
        "plugins/dogma/README.md": "# dogma\n\nFlexible sync of Claude instructions from any source, with enforcement hooks for security and consistency. Use the opinionated [default rules](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-dogma) or bring your own.\n\n## Why dogma?\n\nClaude Code is powerful, but without guardrails it's YOLO mode - and many developers (or their employers) don't want that.\n\n### For Teams and Enterprises\n\n**Single Source of Truth**: Define your coding standards, security rules, and AI guidelines once. Use the [default source repository](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-dogma) or create your own - every team member syncs from the same source, ensuring consistency across the organization.\n\n**Custom Rules, Your Way**: dogma doesn't force you to use anyone's defaults. Point it at your own private repository with your company's specific guidelines. The only requirement: a similar structure to the [default source repository](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-dogma).\n\n**No AI Traces in Code**: Many companies prohibit AI-generated artifacts in their codebase. dogma's hooks and cleanup commands help detect and remove typical AI patterns (curly quotes, em-dashes, AI phrases) before they reach your commits.\n\n**Smart Merging**: When syncing rules, dogma doesn't blindly overwrite your local customizations. It handles merging intelligently, so project-specific rules stay intact while shared standards get updated.\n\n### For Individual Developers\n\n**Sync Across Projects**: Same rules everywhere. Whether you have 5 or 50 repositories, one `/dogma:sync` keeps them all aligned with your personal standards.\n\n**Sync Across Devices**: Work on multiple machines? Your rules live in a source repository - sync them wherever you need them.\n\n### Continuously Maintained\n\nThe [default source repository](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-dogma) is actively developed and used by the author across all personal and professional projects. Strong self-interest ensures it stays functional and up-to-date.\n\n## Features\n\n### Slash Commands\n\n- `/dogma:sync` - Sync Claude instructions from any source with interactive review\n- `/dogma:cleanup` - Find and fix AI-typical patterns in code\n- `/dogma:lint` - Project-agnostic linting and formatting on staged files (non-interactive)\n- `/dogma:lint:setup` - Interactive setup for linting/formatting tools\n- `/dogma:versioning` - Check and sync version numbers across all config files\n- `/dogma:permissions` - Create or update DOGMA-PERMISSIONS.md interactively\n- `/dogma:force` - Interactively collect and apply CLAUDE rules to the project\n- `/dogma:sanitize-git` - Sanitize git history from Claude/AI traces and fix tracking issues\n- `/dogma:docs-update` - Sync documentation across README files and wiki articles\n- `/dogma:ignore` - Add ignore patterns to multiple locations at once (.gitignore, .git/info/exclude)\n- `/dogma:ignore:audit` - Show which AI patterns are missing from ignore files\n- `/dogma:ignore:sync-all` - Sync AI patterns from sync.md to all local repos (marketplace only)\n- `/dogma:recommended:setup` - Check and install recommended plugins and MCP servers from a source\n\n### Permissions System\n\nControl Claude's autonomy with `DOGMA-PERMISSIONS.md` in your project root:\n\n```markdown\n<permissions>\n- [x] May run `git add` autonomously      # auto\n- [x] May run `git commit` autonomously   # auto\n- [?] May run `git push` autonomously     # ask first\n- [?] May delete files autonomously       # ask first\n</permissions>\n```\n\n| Marker | Mode | Behavior |\n|--------|------|----------|\n| `[x]` | auto | Claude does it automatically |\n| `[?]` | ask | Claude asks for confirmation |\n| `[ ]` | deny | Blocked (manual only) |\n\nRun `/dogma:permissions` to configure interactively.\n\n### Enforcement Hooks\n\n- Git permissions, secrets detection\n- File protection, prompt injection detection\n- AI traces validation, language rules reminders\n- Dependency verification (asks before package installs)\n- All hooks toggleable via environment variables\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch for all hooks |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_PRE_COMMIT_LINT` | `true` | Block git commit until /dogma:lint is run |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_SKIP_LINT_CHECK` | `false` | Skip pre-commit lint check (set by Claude after lint) |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_AUTO_FORMAT` | `true` | Allow automatic formatting of staged files |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_LINT_ON_STOP` | `true` | Run lint check when task completes (fallback) |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_MODEL_POLICY` | `true` | Toggle for model enforcement hook |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_FORCE_PARENT_MODEL` | `true` | Enforce parent model for all plugins |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_BUILTIN_INHERIT_MODEL` | `true` | Force built-in agents to inherit parent model |\n| `CLAUDE_MB_DOGMA_ALLOW_MODEL_DOWNGRADE` | `false` | Allow explicit model downgrades below parent |\n\n### Usage Warning\n\nThe enforcement hooks increase token consumption significantly. Recommended for Claude Max 20x (or minimum Max 5x). For sync-only usage without hooks, any plan works.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- `jq` - JSON processor (install: `sudo apt install jq`)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin marketplace add Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace\nclaude plugin install dogma@marcel-bich-claude-marketplace\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation, hook details, configuration, and customization options:\n\n**[View Documentation on Wiki](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace/wiki/Claude-Code-Dogma-Plugin)**\n\n## License\n\nMIT - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms.\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Keywords / Tags</summary>\n\nClaude Code, Claude Code Plugin, Claude Code Extension, Claude Code Hooks, Claude Code Rules, Claude Code Enforcement, Claude Code Security, Claude Code Git, Claude Code Secrets, Claude Code Dependencies, Claude Code AI Traces, Claude Code Prompt Injection, Claude Code Instructions, Claude Code CLAUDE.md, Claude Code Configuration, Claude Code Settings, Claude Code Customization, Claude Code Workflow, Claude Code Automation, Claude Code Best Practices, Claude Code Guidelines, Claude Code Standards, Claude Code Conventions, Claude Code Linting, Claude Code Validation, Claude Code Protection, Claude Code Safety, Claude Code Guard, Claude Code Filter, Claude Code Block, Claude Code Warn, Claude Code Remind, Claude Code Sync, Claude Code Merge, Claude Code Import, Claude Code Export, Anthropic CLI, Anthropic Plugin, Anthropic Extension, Anthropic Claude, Anthropic AI, AI Agent Rules, AI Agent Guidelines, AI Agent Instructions, AI Agent Configuration, AI Agent Customization, AI Code Assistant, AI Coding, AI Programming, AI Development, LLM Rules, LLM Guidelines, LLM Instructions, LLM Configuration, Git Hooks, Git Protection, Git Security, Git Secrets, Git Credentials, Git Add Protection, Git Commit Protection, Git Push Protection, Secret Detection, Credential Detection, API Key Protection, Environment Variables, Prompt Injection Detection, Prompt Injection Protection, Prompt Injection Guard, AI Traces Detection, AI Traces Removal, Git History Sanitization, Git History Cleanup, Force Push, Filter Branch, Curly Quotes, Em Dashes, Smart Quotes, Typography Cleanup, German Umlauts, Language Rules, Code Quality, Code Standards, Code Conventions, Code Review, Pre-commit Hooks, Post-commit Hooks, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop Hook, Marcel Bich, marcel-bich-claude-marketplace, dogma plugin, rules enforcement plugin\n\n</details>\n",

Your record only gets broken by higher usage\n- **Converges to real limit over time** - The more you work, the closer you get to the real API limit\n- **Separate highscores per plan** - Switching plans (max20/max5/pro) uses the correct highscore for each\n- **5h and 7d are independent records** - Each window has its own highscore\n\n**LimitAt Achievement:** If you push hard enough to reach >95% API utilization when breaking your highscore, you discover the real limit of your plan - like an Easter-Egg!\n\n**State file:** `~/.claude/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace/limit/limit-highscore-state.json`\n\n## Debug Scripts\n\nThe plugin includes debug scripts for troubleshooting:\n\n- `debug-progress.sh` - Debug progress bar rendering\n\nRun from the plugin scripts directory:\n\n```bash\n~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace/plugins/limit/scripts/debug-progress.sh\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor additional documentation, ccstatusline integration, and troubleshooting:\n\n**[View Documentation on Wiki](https://github.com/Marcel-Bich/marcel-bich-claude-marketplace/wiki/Claude-Code-Limit-Plugin)**\n\n## License\n\nMIT -

        "plugins/import/README.md": "# Import Plugin\n\nImport external documentation locally for Claude Code. Uses smart fallback chain to bypass AI-blocking sites.\n\n## Problem\n\nSome documentation sites (like Pimcore) block AI access via WebFetch. This plugin uses a priority chain:\n\n1. **Context7** - Check if library exists in Context7 database (fastest, structured)\n2. **WebFetch** - Direct fetch if not in Context7 (fast)\n3. **Playwright** - Browser automation if blocked (bypasses bot detection)\n\nUser is informed at each fallback step.\n\n## Dynamic Folder Structure\n\nImports are organized intelligently in `mabi-import/`:\n\n```\nmabi-import/\n  pimcore/                    # Library documentation\n    v2025.4/\n      datahub.md\n      data-importer.md\n  react/\n    v19/\n      hooks.md\n  website/                    # Regular websites\n    example.com/\n      api-docs.md\n  local/                      # Local file imports\n    myproject/\n      config.md\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/import:url-or-path <url\\|path>` | Import from URL or local path |\n| `/import:list` | List all cached documentation |\n| `/import:search <query>` | Search within cached docs |\n| `/import:update [pattern]` | Re-fetch from original source |\n\n## Usage\n\n### Import from URL\n\n```\n/import:url-or-path https://docs.pimcore.com/platform/Data_Importer/\n```\n\nThe plugin will:\n1. Check Context7 for \"pimcore\" documentation\n2. Detect version (e.g., v2025.4)\n3. Save to `mabi-import/pimcore/v2025.4/data-importer.md`\n\n### Import local files\n\n```\n/import:url-or-path /path/to/local/docs/config.md\n```\n\nYou will be asked to confirm and provide context for organization.\n\n### Search cached docs\n\n```\n/import:search CSV format\n```\n\n### Update cached docs\n\n```\n/import:update                 # List all, choose interactively\n/import:update pimcore         # Update all pimcore docs\n/import:update pimcore/v2025.4 # Update specific version\n```\n\nWhen a library has a new version online, the old version is preserved and a new folder is created. This keeps historical documentation available for users on older versions.\n\n## Stored Format\n\nImported docs include metadata:\n\n```markdown\n---\nsource: https://docs.pimcore.com/platform/Data_Importer/\nimported: 2026-01-17\nmethod: context7\nversion: v2025.4\n---\n\n# Document Title\n\nContent...\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Context7 MCP plugin (recommended, for structured docs)\n- Playwright MCP plugin (for blocked sites, runs visible - NOT headless to bypass bot detection)\n- WebFetch tool (built-in)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
