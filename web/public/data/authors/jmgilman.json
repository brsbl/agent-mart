        "plugin/commands/install.md": "# Install sow CLI\n\nYou are helping the user install the `sow` CLI tool on their local machine. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful installation.\n\n## Your Task\n\nGuide the user through installing the sow CLI, preferring Homebrew when available, falling back to direct binary download when necessary.\n\n## Step 1: Detect Platform and Environment\n\nFirst, gather information about the user's system:\n\n1. **Detect platform**: Run `uname -s` to determine OS (Darwin=macOS, Linux, MINGW/MSYS=Windows)\n2. **Detect architecture**: Run `uname -m` to determine architecture (x86_64, arm64, aarch64)\n3. **Check Homebrew availability**: Run `which brew` to see if Homebrew is installed (macOS/Linux only)\n4. **Fetch latest version**: Get the latest release from GitHub API:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jmgilman/sow/releases/latest | grep '\"tag_name\"' | sed -E 's/.*\"([^\"]+)\".*/\\1/'\n   ```\n\n## Step 2: Present Recommendation\n\nBased on your detection, present the user with:\n\n- Detected platform and architecture\n- Available installation methods\n- **Recommended method**:\n  - If Homebrew is available → **Homebrew installation** (easier, handles updates)\n  - Otherwise → **Direct binary download** (works everywhere)\n\n**Important**: Ask the user to confirm they want to proceed with the recommended method before continuing.\n\n## Step 3: Execute Installation\n\n### Option A: Homebrew Installation (Preferred)\n\nIf Homebrew is available and user confirmed:\n\n1. Run the installation command:\n   ```bash\n   brew install jmgilman/apps/sow\n   ```\n\n2. Wait for completion and show output to user\n\n3. Skip to Step 4 (Verification)\n\n### Option B: Direct Binary Download (Fallback)\n\nIf Homebrew is not available or user prefers direct download:\n\n1. **Construct download URL** based on detected platform:\n\n   Format: `https://github.com/jmgilman/sow/releases/download/{VERSION}/sow_{VERSION}_{OS}_{ARCH}.{EXT}`\n\n   Where:\n   - `{VERSION}` = latest version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)\n   - `{OS}` = Platform name:\n     - macOS: `Darwin`\n     - Linux: `Linux`\n     - Windows: `Windows`\n   - `{ARCH}` = Architecture:\n     - x86_64: `x86_64`\n     - arm64/aarch64: `arm64`\n   - `{EXT}` = Archive extension:\n     - macOS/Linux: `tar.gz`\n     - Windows: `zip`\n\n   Example URLs:\n   - macOS Intel: `https://github.com/jmgilman/sow/releases/download/v1.0.0/sow_v1.0.0_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`\n   - Linux ARM: `https://github.com/jmgilman/sow/releases/download/v1.0.0/sow_v1.0.0_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`\n   - Windows: `https://github.com/jmgilman/sow/releases/download/v1.0.0/sow_v1.0.0_Windows_x86_64.zip`\n\n2. **Download and extract**:\n   ```bash\n   # Create temp directory\n   TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)\n   cd $TEMP_DIR\n\n   # Download (replace URL with constructed URL)\n   curl -L -o archive.tar.gz \"https://github.com/jmgilman/sow/releases/download/{VERSION}/{FILENAME}\"\n\n   # Extract\n   tar -xzf archive.tar.gz  # Use 'unzip archive.zip' for Windows\n   ```\n\n3. **Install to ~/.local/bin**:\n   ```bash\n   # Create directory if it doesn't exist\n   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin\n\n   # Move binary\n   mv sow ~/.local/bin/sow\n\n   # Make executable (Unix-like systems)\n   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/sow\n\n   # Clean up\n   cd ~\n   rm -rf $TEMP_DIR\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PATH and update if needed**:\n\n   Check if `~/.local/bin` is in PATH:\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH | grep -q \"$HOME/.local/bin\" && echo \"In PATH\" || echo \"Not in PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   If NOT in PATH, ask the user which shell configuration file(s) to update:\n   - `.zshrc` (Zsh - default on modern macOS)\n   - `.bashrc` (Bash on Linux)\n   - `.bash_profile` (Bash on macOS)\n   - `.profile` (Generic POSIX shell)\n\n   For each selected file:\n   ```bash\n   # Add to shell config (only if not already present)\n   if ! grep -q 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' ~/.zshrc; then\n       echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n   fi\n   ```\n\n   **Inform the user** they need to either:\n   - Restart their terminal, OR\n   - Run `source ~/.zshrc` (or whichever file was modified)\n\n## Step 4: Verify Installation\n\n1. Run the version command:\n   ```bash\n   sow version\n   ```\n\n2. If successful, display:\n   - ✅ Installation successful!\n   - Installed version: `v1.0.0` (or whatever version)\n   - Location: `/path/to/sow` (from `which sow`)\n\n3. Show **Next Steps**:\n   ```\n   Next steps:\n   1. Navigate to your git repository\n   2. Run: sow init\n   3. Follow the prompts to initialize sow in your repository\n\n   For more information, visit: https://github.com/jmgilman/sow\n   ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nHandle these common issues gracefully:\n\n- **Network failures**: Suggest checking internet connection, trying again\n- **Permission errors**: Suggest using appropriate permissions or alternative install location\n- **Unsupported platform**: Inform user and suggest building from source\n- **Binary not found after install**: Check PATH configuration, suggest manual verification\n- **GitHub API rate limit**: Suggest waiting or using a specific version number\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Always show commands before running them (for transparency)\n- Use the Bash tool to execute commands, not echo\n- Check command exit codes and handle errors appropriately\n- Be conversational and explain what you're doing at each step\n- If something fails, explain clearly and suggest alternatives\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: You're helping the user install software on their machine. Be careful, transparent, and always confirm before making system changes.\n"
