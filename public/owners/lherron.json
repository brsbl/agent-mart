I'll iterate until the test passes.\"\n\n> \"I'll fix the bug by first writing a failing test that reproduces it, then modifying the code until the test passes.\"\n\n> \"I'll refactor the module, running the existing test suite after each change to ensure no regressions.\"\n\nThe loop terminates when the verification passes, not when the agent believes the work is done.\n\n## Example\n\n> **User**: \"I want to add some kind of caching\"\n>\n> **Agent**: \"It sounds like you want to reduce redundant computation or network calls by storing results temporarily. I'm assuming:\n> - In-memory cache (not distributed)\n> - Cache invalidation on write\n> - For the API layer, not the database layer\n>\n> If this is correct, I'll start by adding a simple LRU cache wrapper around the API client.\"\n\n## Context Grounding\n\nBefore proposing, orient to the environment:\n\n- Scan for existing patterns that inform reasonable defaults\n- Note what's present that the proposal should integrate with\n- Identify constraints the user may not have stated but likely expects"
