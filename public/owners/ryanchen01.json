                "content": "# Scientific Analysis & Reporting\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Project Exploration & Domain Mapping\nBefore analyzing data, map the scientific context of the repository:\n- **Dependency & Logic Scan**: Check `pyproject.toml` for libraries and `main.py` (or equivalent) for the execution flow.\n- **Consult References**: Check the `references/` directory for background materials, standard definitions (e.g., NEMA, IEC), or methodology specifications. Use these files to define terms and expected behaviors.\n- **Identify Physical Models**: Locate the core logic defining the system (constants, equations like Inverse Square Law, statistical models).\n- **Locate Data**: All experimental and simulation data is stored in `data/` with comprehensive filenames (e.g., `data/radial_positions_10min_run.csv`). Always inspect file headers to confirm units and column definitions. \n- **Locate Assets**: All assets like images or plots are stored in `assets/` with comprehensive filenames.\n\n### 2. Data Analysis & Verification\nDo not rely solely on existing summary text; verify findings by inspecting raw data or running code:\n- **Execution**: If the environment allows, run analysis scripts (e.g., `uv run main.py`) to generate the most recent metrics. You are also allowed to write new Python files/scripts for analyzing data. If a package you need does not exist, you are allowed to use `uv add <package>` to add it. \n- **Extract Key Metrics**:\n  - **Performance**: Efficiency, throughput, sensitivity, etc.\n  - **Signal Quality**: SNR, Contrast, Resolution, etc.\n  - **Statistics**: Mean, Standard Deviation, CV, etc.\n- **Cross-Reference**: Compare your calculated results against theoretical expectations found in `references/`.\n\n### 3. Goal Confirmation\n**Crucial Step**: Before generating the full text of the report, pause and present a brief plan to the user to ensure alignment:\n1.  **Objective**: State what you understand the primary goal to be (e.g., \"I will compare the sensitivity of X vs Y\").\n2.  **Data Sources**: List the specific files you intend to use (e.g., \"Using `data/contrast.csv` and `references/nema_standards.pdf`\").\n3.  **Proposed Structure**: Briefly outline the sections you will write.\n4.  **Action**: Ask the user, \"Does this plan match your requirements?\" and wait for their confirmation or correction.\n\n### 4. Report Generation\nUnless otherwise specified, always consolidate findings into a new file named `docs/analysis-report.md`.\n\n**Report Structure:**\n1.  **Objective**: Define the goal (e.g., \"Compare Method A vs. Method B\").\n2.  **Methodology**: Describe the experimental setup. Explicitly cite the specific data files used from `data/` and standards from `references/`.\n3.  **Quantitative Results**: Present data in Markdown tables. Compare distinct groups (e.g., Control vs. Variable).\n4.  **Discussion & Interpretation**:\n    - Explain *why* the results occurred using the identified physical/math models.\n    - Justify any approximations used in the code.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Summary of the primary findings.\n\n### 5. Writing Standards\n- **Quantify Everything**: Avoid vague terms. Use \"12.5% higher efficiency\" rather than \"better efficiency.\"\n- **Writing Style**: Use a professional tone. Lean towards writing in natural language paragraphs instead of using bullet points or lists. \n- **Visuals**: If plots are generated, reference their filenames in the report.\n- **Language**: Write in Simplified Chinese. For specific translations, see [translations.md](references/translations.md).\n- **Headings**: \n    - Do not number headings. \n    - The title should not be a heading, so sections should use heading 1 instead of 2.\n- **Formulas**: \n    - Use LaTex for isotopic notation (e.g., `^{99m}Tc`).\n    - Use LaTeX-style formulas (e.g., `$E = mc^2$`).\n    - Use `$$` to delimit multi-line formulas.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: General Performance Analysis\n**User:** \"Analyze the stability of the sensor data in this repo.\"\n**Action:**\n1.  Read `references/sensor_datasheet.md` to find the nominal operating range.\n2.  Load `data/sensor_stability_log_24hours.csv`.\n3.  Calculate mean and variance.\n4.  **Generate `docs/analysis-report.md`**:\n    - **Methods**: \"Compared observed variance in `data/sensor_stability_log_24hours.csv` against specs in `references/sensor_datasheet.md`.\"\n    - **Results**: Table showing stability metrics.\n    - **Discussion**: Explain deviations based on noise models found in `main.py`.\n\n### Example 2: Comparative Method Study\n**User:** \"Compare the simulation results between the 'Fast' and 'Accurate' algorithms.\"\n**Action:**\n1.  Locate `data/simulation_output_fast_algo.csv` and `data/simulation_output_accurate_algo.csv`.\n2.  Compare key metrics: Execution time vs. Error rate.\n3.  **Generate `docs/analysis-report.md`**:\n    - **Objective**: \"Evaluate trade-off between speed and precision.\"\n    - **Results**: \"The 'Fast' algorithm is 10x faster but introduces a 2.3% systematic error.\"\n    - **Discussion**: Link the error to the approximation found in the code logic."
