If it's a one-off analysis, don't create a framework.\n\n2. **Future Value Test:** Can you articulate a concrete future scenario where having this framework changes Claude's approach for the better?\n\n3. **Structure Test:** Does it have clear structure (criteria, steps, matrix, model)? Vague advice doesn't make a framework.\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Review** — Look at the recent conversation for patterns, decision criteria, or mental models that emerged.\n\n2. **Check for duplicates** — Read `.worldview/frameworks/index.txt`. If a similar framework exists, ask the user: update existing or create new?\n\n3. **Align terminology** — Read `.worldview/terminology.txt`. Use consistent terms from the existing terminology.\n\n4. **Write the framework** — Create `.worldview/frameworks/[framework-name].md` with:\n   - Clear title\n   - When to use this framework\n   - The framework structure (criteria, steps, decision matrix, etc.)\n   - Examples if helpful\n\n   Use kebab-case for framework name (e.g., `decision-matrix.md`, `error-handling-patterns.md`).\n\n5. **Update index** — Append to `.worldview/frameworks/index.txt`:\n   ```\n   [framework-name].md: One-line summary\n   ```\n\n6. **Extract terms** — If the framework introduces terms with non-obvious meanings, append to `.worldview/terminology.txt`:\n   ```\n   [YYYY-MM-DD] *Term*: Definition\n   ```\n   Apply the same bar: only add terms that will help Claude in future sessions.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Keep frameworks focused on a single problem type\n- Use the user's language and framing where possible\n- Reference existing terminology to maintain consistency\n- Keep framework files concise — capture the structure, not exhaustive explanation"

If it takes a paragraph to explain, it's not crisp enough.\n\n### → Anti-patterns\n- **Conceptual**: Wrong problem framing, misaligned assumptions — NOT code smells or tool misuse\n- **Specific**: Clear enough to recognize and avoid\n- **Recurring risk**: Likely to be attempted again without warning\n- **Concise**: One sentence.

Before proposing anything, ask:\n\n1. **Future Value Test:** Will this meaningfully help Claude in future sessions on this project? If you can't articulate a concrete scenario, skip it.\n\n2. **Relevance Test:** Does it connect to what this project is already about? Unrelated frameworks add noise.\n\n3. **Uniqueness Test:** Is this already captured in the worldview, or is it general knowledge Claude already has?\n\n---\n\n## Step 0: Get Source Path\n\nIf no path was provided as an argument, **ask the user** for the file or folder path to import from. Do not guess or scan for files.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Read Source + Project Context\n\n**Source:**\n1. If path is a file: read the file\n2. If path is a folder: use Glob to find `**/*.md` and `**/*.txt`, read all\n3. If >2000 lines: warn user and recommend splitting\n\n**Project context (for relevance checking):**\n- `.worldview/terminology.txt`\n- `.worldview/principles.txt`\n- `.worldview/frameworks/index.txt` (index only, not full frameworks)\n\n### 2. Detect Candidate Frameworks\n\nScan source for structured knowledge that could become frameworks:\n- Decision trees / evaluation criteria\n- Multi-step processes / workflows\n- Mental models with clear structure\n- Comparison matrices / trade-off analyses\n- Causal models / diagnostic frameworks\n\nFor each candidate, apply the bar:\n- **Duplicate check**: Does it already exist in frameworks index?\n- **Relevance check**: Does it connect to project terminology, principles, or existing frameworks?\n- **Future value check**: Will having this framework change Claude's approach in future sessions?\n\nSkip anything that doesn't clearly pass all three.\n\n### 3. Extract Supporting Items\n\nFor each candidate framework, extract:\n\n**Terminology** — Terms central to that framework with non-obvious meanings\n- Must be: Relevant to project, non-obvious, will help Claude in future sessions\n- Format: `*Term*: Definition`\n- Be selective — only terms that genuinely aid understanding\n\n**Insights** — Empirical findings from that framework\n- Must be: Empirical (not normative), project-specific, informative\n- Format: One to two sentences max\n- Be selective — only insights that change how we think about the project\n\n**Note:** Principles and Anti-patterns are excluded from import — they should emerge through distill from conversation context.\n\n### 4. Present Import Plan\n\n**Output ONLY the import plan below — no preamble, no thinking, no commentary.**\n\n```markdown\n## Import Plan\n\n**Source:** [path] ([X files, Y lines])\n\n### Proposed Frameworks\n\n1. **framework-name.md** — One-line purpose\n   Why: Brief reasoning on relevance to project\n   Terms: *Term1*, *Term2*\n\n2. **another-framework.md** — One-line purpose\n   Why: Brief reasoning on relevance\n   Terms: (none)\n\n### Skipped\n\n- **skipped-framework.md** — reason (e.g., \"not relevant to project\", \"duplicate\", \"no clear future value\")\n```\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Keep framework descriptions to ONE line\n- \"Why\" must reference project relevance — connect to existing terminology, principles, or frameworks\n- Only list terminology if the framework introduces terms with non-obvious meanings\n- Show skipped frameworks with brief reason\n- Err on the side of skipping — quality over quantity\n\n**STOP and WAIT for user approval.**\n\n### 5. Execute Approved Imports\n\nOn user approval:\n\n1. **Read schema**: Load `scripts/context-schema.json` to get locations and formats\n2. **Frameworks**: For each approved framework:\n   - Create `.worldview/frameworks/[framework-name].md` (use kebab-case)\n   - Append to index: `[framework-name].md: One-line summary`\n3. **Terminology**: Append terms using schema's `Terminology.location` and `lineFormat`\n4. **Insights**: Append insights using schema's `Insights.location` and `lineFormat`\n5. **Report summary**:\n   ```\n   ## Import Complete\n\n   - frameworks: +N\n   - terminology.txt: +N terms\n   - insights.txt: +N insights\n\n   Total: X items imported from [source]\n   ```\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Few/no relevant frameworks found**: This is fine — report what was skipped and why\n- **All duplicates**: Report \"All frameworks already exist or don't pass the bar\"\n- **User removes all items**: Report \"No items approved for import\"\n- **Path not found**: Report error and stop"
