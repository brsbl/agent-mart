Skipping steps or deviating from the procedure will result in incomplete analysis. This is non-negotiable.\n\n## File Structure\n\n- **SKILL.md** (this file): Main instructions and MANDATORY workflow\n- **examples.md**: Usage scenarios with different diff types\n- **../../context/git/**: Shared git context files\n  - `git_diff_reference.md`: Unified diff format reference and best practices\n  - `diff_patterns.md`: Common patterns to identify in code changes\n- **../../memory/skills/get-git-diff/**: Project-specific diff analysis memory\n  - `{project-name}/`: Per-project diff patterns and insights\n- **scripts/**:\n  - `README.md`: Complete documentation for all helper scripts\n  - `validate.sh`: Git repository and commit validation functions\n  - `commit_info.sh`: Commit metadata retrieval (hash, author, date, message)\n  - `diff_stats.sh`: Diff statistics and line count analysis\n  - `file_operations.sh`: File operation detection (add, modify, delete, rename)\n  - `utils.sh`: General utilities (branch detection, formatting, repo info)\n- **templates/**:\n  - `output_template.md`: Standard output format template\n\n## Analysis Focus Areas\n\nGit diff analysis evaluates 7 critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Change Scope**: Files affected, lines modified, overall impact radius\n2. **Change Type**: Feature addition, bug fix, refactoring, configuration change\n3. **Structural Changes**: File renames, moves, deletions, additions\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Breaking changes, API modifications, database migrations\n5. **Code Quality Impact**: Complexity changes, test coverage changes\n6. **Merge Conflicts**: Merge commit analysis, conflict resolution patterns\n7. **Performance Impact**: Algorithm changes, database query modifications, resource usage\n\n**Note**: Analysis depth is summary-level, focusing on what changed and high-level impact.\n\n---\n\n## MANDATORY WORKFLOW (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)\n\n### �\u000f STEP 1: Commit Identification (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. Check if commit hashes/branch names were provided in the triggering prompt\n2. If NOT provided, ask the user with these options:\n   - **Option A**: Compare specific commit hashes (ask for two commit SHAs)\n   - **Option B**: Compare HEAD of current branch to main/master\n   - **Option C**: Compare two branch names\n   - **Option D**: Compare current changes to a specific commit\n3. Validate that provided commits/branches exist in the repository\n4. Use `git rev-parse` to verify and get full commit hashes\n5. Get commit metadata (author, date, message) for both commits\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT VALID COMMITS**\n\n### �\u000f STEP 2: Execute Git Diff with Special Handling (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. Execute `git diff [commit1]...[commit2]` to get the unified diff\n2. Check for and handle special cases:\n   - **Large diffs** (>1000 lines): Warn user, offer to summarize only or proceed\n   - **Renamed files**: Use `git diff -M` to detect renames\n   - **Merge commits**: Use `git diff [commit]^...[commit]` for merge commit analysis\n   - **Binary files**: Note binary file changes separately\n3. Get diff statistics with `git diff --stat`\n4. Get file list with `git diff --name-status` to identify A/M/D/R operations\n\n**DO NOT SKIP SPECIAL CASE DETECTION**\n\n### �\u000f STEP 3: Analyze and Summarize (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST analyze and document**:\n1. **Commit Metadata**:\n   - Commit hashes (full and short)\n   - Author and date for both commits\n   - Commit messages\n   - Number of commits between the two refs (if applicable)\n\n2. **Change Statistics**:\n   - Total files changed\n   - Total insertions (+)\n   - Total deletions (-)\n   - Net change\n\n3. **File Operations**:\n   - Added files (A)\n   - Modified files (M)\n   - Deleted files (D)\n   - Renamed files (R) - show old vs new\n   - Copied files (C)\n\n4. **Change Categorization**:\n   - Group files by type (source code, tests, docs, config)\n   - Identify potential areas of impact\n   - Flag potentially risky changes\n\n5. **Special Notes**:\n   - Merge commit indicator (if applicable)\n   - Large diff warning (if >1000 lines)\n   - Binary file changes\n   - Submodule changes\n\n**DO NOT SKIP ANALYSIS**\n\n### � STEP 4: Generate Output & Update Project Memory (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. Use the template from `templates/output_template.md`\n2. Create filename: `diff_{short_hash1}_{short_hash2}.md`\n3. Include all components:\n   - Header with commit information\n   - Summary section with all statistics and analysis\n   - Full unified diff wrapped in markdown code blocks\n4. Save to `/claudedocs/` directory\n5. Confirm file was written successfully\n\n**Output Format Requirements**:\n- Unified diff must be in triple-backtick code blocks with `diff` language tag\n- Summary must be in clear markdown sections\n- File paths must use code formatting\n- Statistics must be in tables or lists\n- All sections must be clearly labeled\n\n**DO NOT OMIT ANY REQUIRED SECTIONS**\n\n**OPTIONAL: Update Project Memory**\n\nIf patterns emerge during analysis, consider storing insights in `../../memory/skills/get-git-diff/{project-name}/`:\n- Common file change patterns\n- Frequently modified areas\n- Notable commit patterns or conventions\n\n---\n\n## Special Case Handling\n\n### Large Diffs (>1000 lines)\n\nWhen encountering large diffs:\n1. Calculate total line count\n2. Warn user: \"This diff contains [N] lines across [M] files\"\n3. Ask user: \"Would you like to proceed with full diff or summary only?\"\n4. If summary only:\n   - Include all metadata and statistics\n   - List all changed files with their line counts\n   - Omit the detailed unified diff\n   - Note: \"Full diff omitted due to size. Use `git diff [hash1]...[hash2]` to view.\"\n\n### Renamed/Moved Files\n\nFor file renames:\n1. Use `git diff -M` flag to detect renames (default similarity index: 50%)\n2. In summary, clearly show: `old/path/file.py � new/path/file.py`\n3. Indicate if content was also modified: `R+M` (renamed and modified)\n4. In unified diff, show rename header: `rename from/to`\n\n### Merge Commits\n\nFor merge commits:\n1. Detect with `git rev-list --merges`\n2. Note in summary: \"This is a merge commit\"\n3. Show both parent commits\n4. Use `git diff [commit]^...[commit]` to show changes introduced by merge\n5. Optionally offer to show diff against each parent separately\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Checklist\n\nBefore completing ANY diff analysis, verify:\n- [ ] Step 1: Commits identified and validated\n- [ ] Step 2: Git diff executed with special case detection\n- [ ] Step 3: Complete analysis with all statistics and categorization\n- [ ] Step 4: Output generated in correct format and saved to /claudedocs\n\n**FAILURE TO COMPLETE ALL STEPS INVALIDATES THE ANALYSIS**\n\n---\n\n## Output File Naming Convention\n\n**Format**: `diff_{short1}_{short2}.md`\n\nWhere:\n- `{short1}` = First 7 characters of first commit hash\n- `{short2}` = First 7 characters of second commit hash\n\n**Examples**:\n- `diff_a1b2c3d_e4f5g6h.md` (commit to commit)\n- `diff_main_feature-branch.md` (branch comparison, if hashes not available)\n\n**Alternative for branches**: If comparing branch tips, you may use branch names if they're short and filesystem-safe.\n\n---\n\n## Git Commands Reference\n\n### Core Commands Used:\n```bash\n# Get commit info\ngit rev-parse [commit]\ngit log -1 --format=\"%H|%h|%an|%ae|%ad|%s\" [commit]\n\n# Generate diff\ngit diff [commit1]...[commit2]\ngit diff --stat [commit1]...[commit2]\ngit diff --name-status [commit1]...[commit2]\ngit diff -M [commit1]...[commit2]  # Detect renames\n\n# Special cases\ngit rev-list --merges [commit]  # Check if merge commit\ngit diff [commit]^1..[commit]   # Merge commit against first parent\n```\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\nRefer to official documentation:\n- **Git Documentation**:\n  - Git Diff: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff\n  - Diff Format: https://git-scm.com/docs/diff-format\n- **Best Practices**:\n  - Pro Git Book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2\n  - Understanding Git Diff: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_generating_patches_with_p\n\n---\n\n## Version History\n\n- v1.1.0 (2025-01-XX): Centralized context and project memory\n  - Context files moved to ../../context/git/\n  - Project-specific memory system in ../../memory/skills/get-git-diff/\n  - Optional memory updates for common patterns\n- v1.0.0 (2025-11-13): Initial release\n  - Mandatory 4-step workflow\n  - Summary-level analysis with statistics\n  - Special handling for large diffs, renames, and merge commits\n  - Unified diff output to /claudedocs"

                "content": "# Python Code Review Expert\n\n## ⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE ⚠️\n\n**CRITICAL**: The 5-step workflow outlined in this document MUST be followed in exact order for EVERY code review. Skipping steps or deviating from the procedure will result in incomplete and unreliable reviews. This is non-negotiable.\n\n## File Structure\n\n- **SKILL.md** (this file): Main instructions and MANDATORY workflow\n- **examples.md**: Review scenarios with before/after examples\n- **../../context/python/**: Framework patterns and detection logic\n  - `context_detection.md`, `common_issues.md`, `{framework}_patterns.md`\n- **../../context/security/**: Security guidelines and OWASP references\n  - `security_guidelines.md`, `owasp_python.md`\n- **../../memory/skills/python-code-review/**: Project-specific memory storage\n  - `{project-name}/`: Per-project learned patterns and context\n- **templates/**: `report_template.md`, `inline_comment_template.md`\n\n## Review Focus Areas\n\nDeep reviews evaluate 8 critical dimensions **in the changed code**:\n\n1. **Production Quality**: Correctness, edge cases, error recovery, resilience\n2. **Deep Bugs**: Race conditions, memory leaks, resource exhaustion, subtle logic errors\n3. **Security**: Injection flaws, auth bypasses, insecure deserialization, data exposure\n4. **Performance**: Algorithmic complexity, N+1 queries, memory inefficiency, I/O blocking\n5. **Architecture**: Tight coupling, missing abstractions, SOLID violations, circular deps\n6. **Reliability**: Transaction safety, error handling, resource leaks, idempotency\n7. **Scalability**: Concurrency issues, connection pooling, pagination, unbounded consumption\n8. **Testing**: Missing critical tests, inadequate edge case coverage\n\n**Note**: Focus on substantive issues requiring human judgment, not style/formatting details. Reviews are performed on changed code only, using the `get-git-diff` skill to identify modifications.\n\n---\n\n## MANDATORY WORKFLOW (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 1: Identify Changed Files via Git Diff (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. **Invoke the `get-git-diff` skill** to identify changed Python files\n2. Ask clarifying questions to determine comparison scope:\n   - Which commits/branches to compare? (e.g., `HEAD^ vs HEAD`, `main vs feature-branch`)\n   - If not specified, default to comparing current changes against the default branch\n   - Use the diff output to extract the list of modified Python files (`.py` extension)\n3. If no Python files were changed, inform the user and exit gracefully\n4. Focus subsequent review ONLY on the files identified in the diff\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT GIT DIFF ANALYSIS**\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 2: Load Project Memory & Context Detection (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. **CHECK PROJECT MEMORY FIRST**: \n   - Identify the project name from the repository root or ask the user\n   - Check `../../memory/skills/python-code-review/{project-name}/` for existing project memory\n   - If memory exists, read all files to understand previously learned patterns, frameworks, and project-specific context\n   - If no memory exists, you will create it later in this process\n2. Analyze changed files' structure and imports\n3. **READ** `../../context/python/context_detection.md` to identify framework\n4. Determine which framework-specific patterns file(s) to load\n5. Ask clarifying questions in Socratic format:\n   - What is the purpose of these changes?\n   - Specific concerns to focus on?\n   - Deployment environment?\n   - Any project-specific conventions or patterns to be aware of?\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS STEP**\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 3: Read Pattern Files (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST read these files based on context**:\n\n1. **ALWAYS**: `../../context/python/common_issues.md` (universal anti-patterns and deep bugs)\n2. **If Django detected**: `../../context/python/django_patterns.md`\n3. **If Flask detected**: `../../context/python/flask_patterns.md`\n4. **If FastAPI detected**: `../../context/python/fastapi_patterns.md`\n5. **If data science detected**: `../../context/python/datascience_patterns.md`\n6. **If ML detected**: `../../context/python/ml_patterns.md`\n7. **For security reviews**: `../../context/security/security_guidelines.md` AND `../../context/security/owasp_python.md`\n\n**Progressive loading**: Only read framework files when detected. Don't load all upfront.\n\n**DO NOT SKIP PATTERN FILE READING**\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 4: Deep Manual Review of Changed Code (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST examine ONLY the changed code for ALL categories below**:\n\n**Important**: While reviewing changed lines, consider the surrounding context to understand:\n- How changes interact with existing code\n- Whether changes introduce regressions\n- Impact on callers and dependent code\n- Whether the change addresses the root cause or masks symptoms\n\n**Review Categories**:\n\n**Production Readiness**: Edge cases, input validation, error recovery, resource cleanup, timeouts\n**Deep Bugs**: Race conditions, memory leaks, off-by-one errors, unhandled exceptions, state corruption, infinite loops, integer overflow, timezone issues\n**Architecture**: Tight coupling, missing abstractions, SOLID violations, global state, circular dependencies\n**Security**: SQL/NoSQL/Command injection, auth bypasses, insecure deserialization, SSRF, XXE, crypto weaknesses, data exposure, missing rate limiting\n**Performance**: O(n²) complexity, N+1 queries, memory leaks, blocking I/O in async, missing indexes, inefficient data structures, cache stampede\n**Scalability**: Connection pool exhaustion, lock contention, deadlocks, missing pagination, unbounded consumption\n**Reliability**: Transaction boundaries, data races, resource leaks, missing idempotency\n\n**DO NOT SKIP ANY CATEGORY**\n\n### ⚠️ STEP 5: Generate Output & Update Project Memory (REQUIRED)\n\n**YOU MUST ask user for preferred output format**:\n\n- **Option A**: Structured report (`templates/report_template.md`) → executive summary, categorized findings, action items → output to `claudedocs/`\n- **Option B**: Inline comments (`templates/inline_comment_template.md`) → file:line feedback, PR-style\n- **Option C (Default)**: Both formats\n\n**DO NOT CHOOSE FORMAT WITHOUT USER INPUT**\n\n**For EVERY issue in the output, YOU MUST provide**:\n1. **Severity**: Critical / Important / Minor\n2. **Category**: Security / Performance / Code Quality / Architecture / Reliability\n3. **Description**: What is wrong and why it matters\n4. **Fix**: Concrete code example with improvement\n5. **Reference**: Link to PEP, OWASP, or framework docs\n6. **File:line**: Exact location (e.g., `auth.py:142`)\n\n**Format guidelines**:\n- Explain WHY (not just what)\n- Show HOW to fix with examples\n- Be specific with file:line references\n- Be balanced (acknowledge good patterns)\n- Educate, don't criticize\n\n**DO NOT PROVIDE INCOMPLETE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**After completing the review, UPDATE PROJECT MEMORY**:\n\nCreate or update files in `../../memory/skills/python-code-review/{project-name}/`:\n\n1. **project_overview.md**: Framework, architecture patterns, deployment info\n2. **common_patterns.md**: Project-specific coding patterns and conventions discovered\n3. **known_issues.md**: Recurring issues or anti-patterns found in this project\n4. **review_history.md**: Summary of reviews performed with dates and key findings\n\nThis memory will be consulted in future reviews to provide context-aware analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Checklist\n\nBefore completing ANY review, verify:\n- [ ] Step 1: Git diff analyzed using `get-git-diff` skill and changed Python files identified\n- [ ] Step 2: Project memory checked in `../../memory/skills/python-code-review/{project-name}/` and context detected\n- [ ] Step 3: All relevant pattern files read from `../../context/python/` and `../../context/security/`\n- [ ] Step 4: Manual review completed for ALL categories on changed code only\n- [ ] Step 5: Output generated with all required fields AND project memory updated\n\n**FAILURE TO COMPLETE ALL STEPS INVALIDATES THE REVIEW**\n\n## Further Reading\n\nRefer to the official documentation:\n- **Python Standards**:\n  - Python PEPs: https://peps.python.org/\n  - OWASP Python Security: https://owasp.org/www-project-python-security/\n- **Frameworks**:\n  - Django, Flask, FastAPI official documentation\n- **Best Practices**:\n  - Real Python: https://realpython.com/\n\n## Version History\n\n- v2.1.0 (2025-11-14): Refactored to use centralized context and project-specific memory system\n  - Context files moved to `forge-plugin/context/python/` and `forge-plugin/context/security/`\n  - Project memory stored in `forge-plugin/memory/skills/python-code-review/{project-name}/`\n  - Added project memory loading and persistence in workflow\n- v2.0.0 (2025-11-13): Changed to diff-based review using `get-git-diff` skill - reviews only changed code\n- v1.1.0 (2025-11-13): Removed automated analysis and linting/formatting tools\n- v1.0.0 (2025-11-13): Initial release"
