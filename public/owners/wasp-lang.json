Verify user is in the app directory (check for wasp config file: `main.wasp` or `main.wasp.ts`)\n\n## Available Wasp Features\n\nPresent these features to the user and let them choose ONE to configure:\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **App Branding** | Set your app's name, description, and meta tags |\n| **Authentication** | Add login methods (Email, Google, GitHub, etc.) |\n| **Email Provider** | Configure email sending (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) |\n| **Database** | Set up your database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) |\n| **Styling (CSS, UI)** | Add Tailwind CSS or ShadCN UI (on top of Tailwind CSS) |\n| **Verify Setup** | Test that your app compiles and runs correctly |\n\n## Feature Selection\n\nUsing the `AskUserQuestion` tool, ask the user which Wasp feature they'd like to configure:\n- Use the most relevant options as selectable choices (limited to 2-4 options)\n- Remind users they can select \"Other\" to choose from additional features\n\n## Execute Selected Feature\n\nBased on the user's selection, follow the corresponding guides below.\nALWAYS follow the feature guide's corresponding raw text documentation URLs and use it as the basis for assisting the user.\n\n- **App Branding** → [app-branding.md](./app-branding.md)\n- **Authentication** → [authentication.md](./authentication.md)\n- **Email Provider** → [email-provider.md](./email-provider.md)\n- **Database** → [database.md](./database.md)\n- **Styling (CSS, UI)** → [styling.md](./styling.md)\n- **Verify Setup** → [verify-setup.md](./verify-setup.md)\n\n## Guidelines for Using AskUserQuestion with Lists\n\nWhen asking the user to choose from fetched lists (e.g., auth methods, email providers):\n\n1. **Always display the full list** to the user before asking them to choose, so they know all available options.\n2. **Use the most popular/common options** as the selectable choices in `AskUserQuestion` (limited to 2-4 options).\n3. **Remind users** they can select \"Other\" to specify any option from the full list that isn't shown in the quick-select options.\n4. **Example format:**\n   ```\n   Available auth methods: Username & Password, Email, Google, GitHub, Discord, Keycloak, Slack\n\n   [AskUserQuestion with 3-4 most common options]\n\n   Note: Select \"Other\" to choose from additional options like Discord, Keycloak, or Slack.\n   ```\n\n## After Feature Completion\n\nAfter completing a feature configuration:\n1. Summarize the changes made\n2. If applicable, let them know if there are any environment variables they need to set and ask them if they need guidance on how to set them\n  - if so, fetch the raw github doc file URL for the environment variables and guide the user through the process\n3. Ask if the user would like to configure another feature\n3. If yes, return to Feature Selection\n4. If no, suggest running \"Verify Setup\" if they haven't already"

Server logs are only visibile to the user from within the `background tasks` tab.\n  - Starting externally (User)\n    - Pros: The user has more direct control over app development and the Wasp CLI commands. Can be advantageous for more advanced users.\n    - Cons: Debugging and feature discovery can be slower, as Claude doesn't have direct access to dev server logs (warnings, errors) or Wasp CLI commands.\n- [ ] Depending on the user's choice, follow the steps below and run the commands for the user as background tasks, or guide them through running them manually in a separate terminal.\n\n### Step 1: Ensure the Development Database is Running\n\nGrep the `.env.server` file for `DATABASE_URL`. If no line starts with `DATABASE_URL`, continue following this step.\nIf the user does have their own DATABASE_URL env var set, move on to [Step 2](#step-2-start-dev-server).\n\nCheck the `schema.prisma` file in the project root for the `datasource` block to see which database is being used.\n\n#### SQLite\n**Skip to [Step 2](#step-2-start-dev-server):** SQLite stores data in a local file, no database server needed.\n\n#### PostgreSQL\nStart the managed database container as a background task:\n```bash\nwasp start db\n```\n\n**Docker needs to be installed and running** for the managed Postgres database container (`wasp start db`) to work.\n\nRun this as a background task in the current claude code session.\nWait 5-15 seconds for the database to be ready.\n\n\n### Step 2: Start Dev Server\n\nRun as a background task:\n```bash\nwasp start\n```\n\nListen to the output from `wasp start` and if it gives a prisma **db migration warning**, follow the [running-db-migrations.md](./running-db-migrations.md) reference.\n\n\n### Step 3: Verify Server is Running\n\nConfirm client (`localhost:3000`) and server (`localhost:3001`) are running by checking the background task output.\n\n**If started as background task in current session:** Listen to the output for development and debugging information.\n**If started externally:** Instruct the user to check the output of the external terminal and share its output with you.\n\n### Step 4: Connect Browser Console Access (Important!)\n\n**This step is critical for effective development and debugging.** Without browser console access, Claude cannot see client-side errors, warnings, or React issues that occur in the browser.\n\nAsk the user (via the AskUserQuestion tool) which method they'd like to use for giving Claude visibility into the browser console:\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Chrome DevTools MCP (recommended)** | Use the `mcp__plugin_wasp_chrome-devtools` tool (bundled with the plugin) |\n| **Built-in Chrome** | Use Claude Code's built-in browser connection (check status with `/chrome` command) |\n| **Manual** | User will manually copy/paste console output when needed |\n| **Other** | User has another preference |"
