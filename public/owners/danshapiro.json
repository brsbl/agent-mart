If nothing is staged, review the most recent commit using git show HEAD.\"\n{{/if}}\n\nThe scope should be a clear, specific instruction telling the reviewer what to examine.\n\n**Good scope examples:**\n- `Review the staged changes using git diff --cached. If nothing is staged, review the most recent commit.`\n- `Review commit abc1234 using git show abc1234.`\n- `Review the files in src/auth/.`\n- `Review the plan in docs/plans/2025-01-03-feature.md.`\n- `Review the changes between main and this branch using git diff main...HEAD.`\n\n**Bad scope examples:**\n- `check out what we just did` (the reviewer has no context for what has happened other than the repo and what you tell it)\n- `review the files in src/auth/ for security issues` (NEVER describe what to look for - the reviewer has independence)\n\n### Step 2: Invoke the independent reviewer\n\nRun the fresheyes script with the scope as the argument:\n\n```bash\n\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/fresheyes/fresheyes.sh\" \"<scope from step 1>\"\n```\n\nIf no scope is provided, it defaults to reviewing staged changes or HEAD.\n\n**Timeout handling:** This skill has a 15-minute timeout. If the review times out, retry the command with a 30-minute timeout (1800000ms).\n\n### Step 3: Report results\n\nOutput the Codex response exactly as returned."
