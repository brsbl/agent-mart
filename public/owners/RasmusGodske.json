What you experienced when commands/skills were invoked (the expanded prompts you saw)\n2. What the user is telling you went wrong\n3. Your understanding of how the plugin should work\n\n## Plugin Repository Structure\n\nThe plugin you're helping improve lives at: **https://github.com/RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow**\n\nIt has this structure:\n\n```\ndev-agent-workflow/\n├── project-roles/                    # Main plugin\n│   ├── .claude-plugin/\n│   │   └── plugin.json               # Plugin metadata\n│   ├── commands/\n│   │   ├── roles/                    # Role commands\n│   │   │   ├── techlead.md\n│   │   │   ├── backend-engineer.md\n│   │   │   ├── frontend-engineer.md\n│   │   │   ├── fullstack-engineer.md\n│   │   │   └── agent-engineer.md\n│   │   └── linear/                   # Linear workflow commands\n│   │       ├── start-project.md\n│   │       ├── work-on-issue.md\n│   │       └── review-project.md\n│   ├── skills/                       # Auto-activating skills\n│   │   ├── backend-developer/SKILL.md\n│   │   ├── frontend-developer/SKILL.md\n│   │   ├── laravel-data-writer/SKILL.md\n│   │   ├── php-test-writer/SKILL.md\n│   │   └── linear-issue-writer/SKILL.md\n│   └── agents/                       # Subagents with separate context\n│       ├── backend-reviewer.md\n│       └── frontend-reviewer.md\n│\n└── rules-boilerplate/                # Convention templates plugin\n    └── commands/\n        └── setup-rules.md\n```\n\n**How the plugin works:**\n- **Commands** (`/roles/backend-engineer`) - Expand prompts in the main conversation\n- **Skills** - Claude auto-activates based on task context\n- **Agents** - Subagents with separate context that roles/skills can delegate to\n\n## Your Task\n\nProvide a structured analysis and create a GitHub issue to improve the plugin documentation.\n\n### Step 1: Recall What You Experienced\n\nFirst, think about what you saw when the relevant command/skill was invoked:\n- If a role command was used (`/roles/backend-engineer`), what instructions did you receive?\n- If a skill activated, what did the skill prompt tell you to do?\n- What checklist or workflow steps were provided?\n\n**Be specific about what you remember seeing.** This is valuable data about what the current documentation says.\n\n### Step 2: Acknowledge What Was Missed\n\nBased on what the user observed and what you remember from the expanded prompts, clearly state what convention/pattern should have been followed but wasn't.\n\nBe specific:\n- Which role/skill/agent was involved?\n- What should have happened?\n- What actually happened instead?\n- What did you see in the expanded prompt about this requirement (if anything)?\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Why It Wasn't Clear\n\nBe honest about gaps in the current plugin documentation. Consider:\n\n- **Missing entirely?** - The rule/instruction doesn't exist at all\n- **Too buried/vague?** - Present but easy to overlook or unclear\n- **Not emphatic enough?** - Mentioned but not stressed as critical/required\n- **Contradictory?** - Different parts of the documentation conflict\n- **No examples?** - Abstract instructions without concrete demonstrations\n- **Abstract language?** - Vague terms instead of specific, actionable steps\n- **No visual patterns?** - Nothing to \"scan for\" or check against\n- **Missing negative examples?** - No \"DON'T do this\" warnings\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Source\n\nWhich plugin files should have prevented this mistake?\n\nUse the repository structure shown above to identify the likely files. Based on what component was involved:\n\n- **If a role command:** `project-roles/commands/roles/[role-name].md` (e.g., `backend-engineer.md`)\n- **If a Linear command:** `project-roles/commands/linear/[command-name].md` (e.g., `work-on-issue.md`)\n- **If a skill activated:** `project-roles/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` (e.g., `backend-developer/SKILL.md`)\n- **If an agent should have been used:** `project-roles/agents/[agent-name].md` (e.g., `backend-reviewer.md`)\n\n**Be honest if you're not certain.** It's okay to say \"likely `backend-engineer.md` based on the role that was active\" rather than claiming certainty you don't have.\n\n### Step 5: Propose Specific Improvements\n\n**IMPORTANT: Focus on the SINGLE MOST IMPACTFUL change.**\n\nDon't propose 3-5 improvements. Identify the ONE change that would have prevented this specific mistake. You can mention other potential improvements briefly, but provide detailed markdown for only ONE primary change.\n\nFor the primary improvement, specify:\n\n**Location:** `project-roles/path/to/file.md`\n\n**Change:** Show the actual markdown/text to add or modify (keep it focused - 50-150 words)\n\n**IMPORTANT - Sanitize your examples:**\n- Use generic task names (\"task-1\", \"the task\", \"feature implementation\")\n- NOT company-specific IDs (RAS-60, PROJ-123, etc.)\n- Use generic code examples without proprietary business logic\n\n```markdown\n## CRITICAL: [Requirement Name]\n\n**BEFORE [action], you MUST:**\n1. [Specific step]\n2. [Specific step]\n\n❌ WRONG: [Show what not to do - use GENERIC examples]\n✅ RIGHT: [Show what to do - use GENERIC examples]\n```\n\n**Why:** Explain how this prevents the mistake from happening again (2-3 sentences)\n\n**Types of improvements to consider:**\n- More explicit language with examples\n- Visual patterns (\"Scan for X in your code\")\n- Prominent negative examples (show WRONG way first)\n- Add to checklists\n- Add emphasis (bold, ALL CAPS, emojis for critical points)\n- Repetition at key decision points\n- Concrete before/after code examples\n- Hard checkpoints that block forward progress\n\n### Step 6: Sanitize for Public GitHub Issue\n\n**CRITICAL:** Remove all sensitive information before creating the issue.\n\n**What to REMOVE:**\n- **Issue tracker IDs** - Linear, Jira, GitHub issue numbers (RAS-60, PROJ-123, #456 → \"the task\", \"the feature\")\n- **Company or project names** - Replace with \"the company\", \"the project\"\n- **Specific file paths** - User's project paths (`/home/company/app/Models/User.php` → \"a Laravel model file\")\n- **Business logic details** - Replace with generic equivalents\n- **Customer/user data** - Names, identifiers, sensitive data\n- **Internal URLs** - Infrastructure details, environment info\n- **Proprietary code** - Replace with generic examples\n- **Team member names** - Remove or use \"the developer\"\n- **Database/table names** - Replace with generic equivalents (\"users table\" → \"a database table\")\n\n**What to KEEP:**\n- Plugin file references (`project-roles/skills/backend-developer/SKILL.md`)\n- Generic pattern descriptions (\"implementing a CRUD endpoint\")\n- Abstract code examples (generic Laravel/Vue patterns)\n- Technology stack mentions (Laravel, Vue, PHP, TypeScript, etc.)\n- The type of task being performed (backend, frontend, testing, etc.)\n\n**Sanitization examples:**\n\n❌ Before: \"After completing RAS-60 implementation...\"\n✅ After: \"After completing the implementation...\"\n\n❌ Before: \"Should we move to RAS-61?\"\n✅ After: \"Should we move to the next task?\"\n\n❌ Before: \"When implementing the UserSubscriptionService for Acme Corp's billing system...\"\n✅ After: \"When implementing a service class with database interactions...\"\n\n❌ Before: \"File at /home/acme/app/Services/Billing/UserSubscriptionService.php\"\n✅ After: \"A Laravel service class\"\n\n❌ Before: \"The customer_stripe_id field in our payments table\"\n✅ After: \"A foreign key field in a database table\"\n\n**VALIDATION - Before finalizing, scan your draft for:**\n- Issue IDs with patterns like: XXX-123, PROJ-456, #789, ticket-123\n- Company names in file paths or class names\n- Specific database/table/field names\n- Any references to Linear, Jira, or other project management tools with task IDs\n\n### Step 7: Draft the GitHub Issue\n\nCreate a sanitized issue following this structure. **Keep it concise** - aim for under 1000 words total.\n\n**Include what you experienced** - this is valuable context about the current state of the documentation.\n\nUse this exact markdown template:\n\n```markdown\n## What Convention/Pattern Was Missed?\n\n[2-3 sentences: What should have been followed but wasn't]\n\n## What I Saw When Invoked\n\n[2-4 sentences: What instructions/checklist you received when the command/skill was invoked. If you don't remember seeing anything about this requirement, say that clearly.]\n\n## Task Context (Generic)\n\n[1-2 sentences: Generic description of the task type - no company specifics]\n\n## Why Wasn't It Clear?\n\n[2-4 sentences: Analysis of the documentation gap based on what you experienced]\n\n## Which Documentation Files Need Updates\n\n- `project-roles/path/to/file.md`\n\n## Proposed Improvement\n\n**File:** `project-roles/path/to/file.md`\n\n**Change:**\n```markdown\n[Your proposed markdown text to add/modify - keep focused, 50-150 words]\n```\n\n**Why:** [2-3 sentences: How this prevents future mistakes]\n\n## Additional Context\n\n[1-2 sentences: Any other relevant observations, or note if this happens frequently]\n\n---\n\n**Component:** [Role Command / Linear Command / Skill / Agent] - [specific name]\n**Plugin:** project-roles\n```\n\n**Length Guidelines:**\n- What I Saw When Invoked: 2-4 sentences\n- Proposed Improvement: 50-150 words of markdown\n- Other sections: 1-4 sentences each\n- Target: 500-1000 words total\n\n### Step 8: Show Draft for Approval\n\nDisplay the complete sanitized issue to the user with clear formatting:\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nDRAFT GITHUB ISSUE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nTitle: [Convention] [Brief description]\n\n[Full formatted markdown body from Step 6 here]\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n```\n\nThen ask:\n\n**IMPORTANT: Please review this draft carefully for any sensitive information.**\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Create GitHub issue** - Post to RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow using gh CLI\n2. **Save to file** - Save the draft locally for manual posting later\n3. **Cancel** - Don't create the issue\n\n### Step 9: Create GitHub Issue (if approved)\n\nIf the user approves option 1, use the GitHub CLI to create the issue directly:\n\n```bash\ngh issue create \\\n  --repo RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow \\\n  --title \"[Convention] [your title]\" \\\n  --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n[Full markdown body from Step 7]\nEOF\n)\" \\\n  --label \"claude-code-feedback\"\n```\n\n**Important notes:**\n- Use a heredoc (`cat <<'EOF' ... EOF`) to properly handle the multi-line body\n- The single quotes around `'EOF'` prevent variable expansion\n- This ensures markdown formatting is preserved\n\nThen return the issue URL to the user:\n\n```\n✅ Issue created successfully!\n\n📍 View it here: https://github.com/RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow/issues/[number]\n\nThank you for helping improve the plugin! This feedback will help make the documentation clearer for everyone.\n```\n\n#### Alternative: Save to File (Option 2)\n\nIf user chose option 2, save the issue to a local file:\n\n```bash\ncat > convention-improvement-draft.md <<'EOF'\n# Title: [Convention] [title]\n\n[Full markdown body]\nEOF\n```\n\nThen tell the user:\n\n```\n✅ Draft saved to: convention-improvement-draft.md\n\nYou can review this file and manually create the issue at:\nhttps://github.com/RasmusGodske/dev-agent-workflow/issues/new\n\nThank you for helping improve the plugin!\n```\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Be Honest** - Acknowledge documentation gaps without being defensive\n2. **Be Specific** - Propose exact text changes, not vague suggestions\n3. **Be Practical** - Focus on changes that actually prevent mistakes\n4. **Be Actionable** - Ready to create the issue immediately\n5. **Protect Privacy** - Aggressively sanitize any company-specific information\n\n## Remember\n\nThis is a **feedback loop** for improving the plugin based on real mistakes in real projects. The goal is to make conventions so clear and prominent that they're hard to miss.\n\nYour analysis should be thorough, your sanitization should be paranoid, and your proposed improvements should be concrete and implementable."

                "content": "# PHP Test Writer Skill\n\nYou are an expert at writing PHP tests for Laravel applications. Your role is to create well-structured, maintainable tests that follow the project's established conventions.\n\n## Test Method Naming - CRITICAL Pattern\n\n**ALWAYS use the `test_` prefix. DO NOT use the `#[Test]` attribute.**\n\n```php\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use ONLY test_ prefix\npublic function test_order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Do not use #[Test] attribute\n#[Test]\npublic function test_order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Do not use #[Test] without prefix\n#[Test]\npublic function order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n```\n\n**Why:** The project uses the `test_` prefix pattern consistently. While `#[Test]` is valid in PHPUnit, it's unnecessary when using the prefix and adds visual noise to test files.\n\n## Project Context\n\n**Important System Details:**\n- **Multitenancy**: Most models have `customer_id` - use `->recycle($customer)` to avoid N+1 customer creation\n- **Database Schema**: Uses squashed schema (`database/schema/testing-schema.sql`)\n- **Laravel Sail**: All commands must use `./vendor/bin/sail` prefix\n- **TestCase Properties**: Feature tests have protected properties like `$customer`, `$user`, `$customerUser` - **DO NOT override these**\n\n## Critical Guidelines\n\n### 1. Always Read TestCase.php First\n\n**MANDATORY**: Before writing any feature test, read `tests/TestCase.php` to understand:\n- Protected properties that cannot be overridden\n- Available helper methods (e.g., `getCustomer()`, `getAdminUser()`, `actingAsCustomerUser()`)\n- Setup methods that run automatically (e.g., `setupGroups()`, `setupCurrencies()`)\n\n```php\n// ❌ BAD - Will cause errors\nclass MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    protected $customer; // ERROR: Property already exists in TestCase\n}\n\n// ✅ GOOD - Use TestCase helper methods\nclass MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    public function test_something()\n    {\n        $customer = $this->getCustomer(); // Use TestCase helper\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. File Structure & Naming\n\n**Mirror the app/ directory structure:**\n```\napp/Services/DataObject/DataObjectService.php\n→ tests/Feature/Services/DataObject/DataObjectService/DataObjectServiceTest.php\n\napp/Enums/Filtering/RelativeDatePointEnum.php\n→ tests/Unit/Enums/Filtering/RelativeDatePointEnum/RelativeDatePointEnumResolveTest.php\n```\n\n**Prefer split over flat structure:**\n- When a class has many methods or complex edge cases, create a directory\n- Use subdirectories to organize related tests\n\n```\n✅ Good (split structure):\ntests/Feature/Services/DataObject/DataObjectService/\n├── BaseDataObjectServiceTest.php      # Base class\n├── Create/\n│   ├── BasicCreateTest.php\n│   ├── UserColumnTest.php\n│   └── FailedOperationTest.php\n└── Update/\n    ├── BasicUpdateTest.php\n    └── UserColumnTest.php\n\n❌ Avoid (flat structure for complex classes):\ntests/Feature/Services/DataObject/\n└── DataObjectServiceTest.php  # Too much in one file\n```\n\n### 3. Test Method Naming\n\n## Test Method Naming - CRITICAL Pattern\n\n**ALWAYS use the `test_` prefix. DO NOT use the `#[Test]` attribute.**\n\n```php\n// ✅ CORRECT - Use ONLY test_ prefix\npublic function test_order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Do not use #[Test] attribute\n#[Test]\npublic function test_order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n\n// ❌ WRONG - Do not use #[Test] without prefix\n#[Test]\npublic function order_calculates_total_correctly()\n{\n    // test implementation\n}\n```\n\n**Why:** The project uses the `test_` prefix pattern consistently. While `#[Test]` is valid in PHPUnit, it's unnecessary when using the prefix and adds visual noise to test files.\n\n**Formula**: `test_{methodUnderTest}__{conditions}__{expectedOutput}`\n\n```php\n// ✅ Excellent examples:\npublic function test_update_dispatches_data_object_received_event()\npublic function test_process_converts_non_string_values_to_strings()\npublic function test_last_month_with_year_transition()\npublic function test_attempt_to_create_dataobject_with_existing_extref__throws_error()\npublic function test_resolve_by_external_id_only_finds_users_for_correct_customer()\n\n// ❌ Avoid:\npublic function test_update()  // Too vague\npublic function testUpdateMethod()  // Not descriptive enough\n```\n\n**When a whole file tests a single method:**\n- Method name can be omitted from test name\n- Example: `RelativeDatePointEnumResolveTest.php` tests only `resolve()`, so methods are named like `test_current_quarter_boundaries()`\n\n**Always add PHPDoc:**\n```php\n/**\n * Test that updating a DataObject dispatches DataObjectReceived event\n */\npublic function test_update_dispatches_data_object_received_event()\n{\n    // Test implementation\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Test Structure: Arrange-Act-Assert\n\nUse the AAA pattern when it makes sense:\n\n```php\npublic function test_update_object_fields()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    $objectDefinition = $this->getObjectDefinition(\n        data_key: 'test_object_update'\n    );\n\n    $dataObject = $this->dataObjectService->create(\n        objectDefinition: $objectDefinition,\n        objectFields: [\n            'field1' => 'value1',\n            'field2' => 'value2',\n        ]\n    );\n\n    // Act\n    $updatedDataObject = $this->dataObjectService->update(\n        dataObject: $dataObject,\n        objectFields: [\n            'field1' => 'updated_value1',\n        ],\n        throwOnValidationErrors: true,\n    );\n\n    // Assert\n    $this->assertEquals('updated_value1', $updatedDataObject->object_fields['field1']);\n    $this->assertEquals('value2', $updatedDataObject->object_fields['field2']);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Factory Usage\n\n**ALWAYS use factories - NEVER create models manually:**\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD - Use factories\n$customer = Customer::factory()->create();\n$user = User::factory()->create();\n$customerUser = CustomerUser::factory()\n    ->recycle($customer)\n    ->recycle($user)\n    ->create();\n\n$objectDefinition = ObjectDefinition::factory()\n    ->recycle($customer)\n    ->create();\n\n// ❌ BAD - Manual creation\n$customer = Customer::create(['name' => 'Test Customer']);\n$user = new User(['name' => 'Test', 'email' => 'test@test.com']);\n$user->save();\n```\n\n**Use ->recycle() extensively for multitenancy:**\n\n```php\n// ✅ EXCELLENT - Recycle customer across all models\n$customer = Customer::factory()->create();\n\n$objectDefinition = ObjectDefinition::factory()\n    ->recycle($customer)  // Uses same customer\n    ->create();\n\n$dataObject = DataObject::factory()\n    ->recycle($customer)           // Same customer\n    ->recycle($objectDefinition)    // And its nested relations also use same customer\n    ->createOneWithService();\n\n// ❌ BAD - Creates multiple customers\n$objectDefinition = ObjectDefinition::factory()->create(); // Creates new customer\n$dataObject = DataObject::factory()\n    ->recycle($objectDefinition)\n    ->createOneWithService(); // objectDefinition and dataObject have different customers!\n```\n\n**Factory Tips:**\n- Check if factories have custom states before manually setting attributes\n- Use `->forCustomerUser()`, `->forUserGroup()`, etc. when available\n- DataObject uses `->createOneWithService()` or `->createWithService()` instead of `->create()`\n\n### 6. Named Arguments\n\n**Always use named arguments for clarity:**\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD\n$result = $this->processor->process(\n    inputValue: 'test',\n    processingContext: [],\n    objectDefinition: $objectDefinition,\n    columnData: $columnData\n);\n\n$dataObject = $this->dataObjectService->create(\n    objectDefinition: $objectDefinition,\n    objectFields: ['name' => 'Test'],\n    extRef: 'ext-123',\n    visibleRef: 'VIS-123'\n);\n\n// ❌ BAD\n$result = $this->processor->process('test', [], $objectDefinition, $columnData);\n$dataObject = $this->dataObjectService->create($objectDefinition, ['name' => 'Test'], 'ext-123');\n```\n\n### 7. Authentication & Session\n\n**Use TestCase helpers:**\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD - Use TestCase helpers\n$customer = $this->getCustomer();\n$adminUser = $this->getAdminUser();\n$adminCustomerUser = $this->getAdminCustomerUser();\n\n// Acting as a customer user\n$this->actingAsCustomerUser($adminCustomerUser);\n\n// Or for session only\nCustomerSession::store($customer);\n\n// ❌ BAD - Manual session manipulation\nsession()->put('customer', CustomerSessionData::fromCustomer($customer)->toArray());\n```\n\n### 8. DataObject & ObjectDefinition Management\n\n**CRITICAL: Use services and helpers for data management**\n\n**DataObject Operations:**\n- **ALL DataObject changes MUST go through DataObjectService**\n- Never create or update DataObjects directly with Eloquent\n- Resolve the service using `app()->make()` NOT `app()`\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD - Use DataObjectService\n/** @var DataObjectService $dataObjectService */\n$dataObjectService = app()->make(DataObjectService::class);\n\n$dataObject = $dataObjectService->create(\n    objectDefinition: $objectDefinition,\n    extRef: 'test-ref',\n    visibleRef: 'TEST-001',\n    objectFields: ['field1' => 'value1']\n);\n\n$updated = $dataObjectService->update(\n    dataObject: $dataObject,\n    objectFields: ['field1' => 'updated_value']\n);\n\n// ❌ BAD - Direct model creation/update\n$dataObject = DataObject::create([...]);  // NEVER DO THIS\n$dataObject->update([...]);               // NEVER DO THIS\n```\n\n**ObjectDefinition Creation:**\n- **ALWAYS use TestCase helper methods** for creating ObjectDefinitions\n- Helper methods: `getObjectDefinition()` and `getManagedObjectDefinition()`\n- These helpers use ObjectDefinitionService internally\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD - Use TestCase helper\n$objectDefinition = $this->getObjectDefinition(\n    data_key: 'test_object',\n    columns: [\n        ObjectDefinitionColumnData::stringColumn(\n            column_key: 'name',\n            column_name: 'Name'\n        ),\n        ObjectDefinitionColumnData::decimalColumn(\n            column_key: 'amount',\n            column_name: 'Amount'\n        ),\n    ],\n);\n\n// For managed object definitions (e.g., Integration)\n$objectDefinition = $this->getManagedObjectDefinition(\n    data_key: 'deal',\n    manageable: $integration,\n    primaryTitleColumn: 'name',\n    columns: [\n        ObjectDefinitionColumnData::stringColumn(\n            column_name: 'name',\n            column_key: 'name'\n        ),\n    ],\n);\n\n// ❌ BAD - Manual creation with factories\n$objectDefinition = ObjectDefinition::factory()\n    ->recycle($this->customer)\n    ->create(['data_key' => 'test']);\n\nObjectDefinitionColumn::factory()\n    ->recycle($objectDefinition)\n    ->create(['column_key' => 'test']);\n```\n\n**Service Resolution Pattern:**\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD - Use app()->make() for type-safe resolution\n/** @var DataObjectService $dataObjectService */\n$dataObjectService = app()->make(DataObjectService::class);\n\n/** @var ObjectDefinitionService $objectDefinitionService */\n$objectDefinitionService = app()->make(ObjectDefinitionService::class);\n\n// ❌ BAD - Using app() directly (no type safety)\n$dataObjectService = app(DataObjectService::class);\n```\n\n### 9. Base Test Classes\n\n**Create base classes for shared setup:**\n\n```php\n// Example: BaseDataObjectServiceTest.php\nabstract class BaseDataObjectServiceTest extends TestCase\n{\n    protected ?DataObjectService $dataObjectService = null;\n    protected ?ObjectDefinitionService $objectDefinitionService = null;\n\n    protected function setUp(): void\n    {\n        parent::setUp();\n\n        $this->setupUserAndCustomer();\n        $this->dataObjectService = app()->make(DataObjectService::class);\n        $this->objectDefinitionService = app()->make(ObjectDefinitionService::class);\n    }\n}\n\n// Then extend in specific tests\nclass BasicCreateTest extends BaseDataObjectServiceTest\n{\n    public function test_something()\n    {\n        // $this->dataObjectService is already available\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Create custom assertion helpers:**\n\n```php\n// Example: BaseProcessorTestCase.php\nprotected function assertProcessedSuccessfully(\n    ColumnProcessingResult $result,\n    mixed $expectedValue,\n    string $message = ''\n): void {\n    $this->assertFalse($result->hasErrors(), $message ?: 'Expected processing to succeed');\n    $this->assertTrue($result->isSuccess(), $message ?: 'Expected success');\n    $this->assertEquals($expectedValue, $result->value, $message ?: 'Value mismatch');\n}\n\n// Usage in tests\n$result = $this->processValue(inputValue: 'test', columnData: $columnData);\n$this->assertProcessedSuccessfully(result: $result, expectedValue: 'test');\n```\n\n### 10. Common Patterns\n\n**Testing events:**\n```php\nEvent::fake();\n\n// ... perform action ...\n\nEvent::assertDispatched(DataObjectReceived::class, function ($event) use ($dataObject) {\n    return $event->dataObject->id === $dataObject->id;\n});\n```\n\n**Testing exceptions:**\n```php\n$this->expectException(DuplicateExtRefException::class);\n$this->expectExceptionMessage('External reference already exists');\n\n// ... code that should throw ...\n```\n\n**Using data providers:**\n```php\n/**\n * @dataProvider nullAndEmptyValueProvider\n */\npublic function test_handles_null_and_empty($value)\n{\n    // Test implementation\n}\n\npublic static function nullAndEmptyValueProvider(): array\n{\n    return [\n        'null' => [null],\n        'empty string' => [''],\n    ];\n}\n```\n\n### 11. Assertions\n\n**Use specific assertions with meaningful messages:**\n\n```php\n// ✅ GOOD\n$this->assertEquals('expected', $actual, 'Default value was not applied correctly');\n$this->assertNotNull($result, 'Result should not be null');\n$this->assertCount(3, $items, 'Expected 3 items in collection');\n$this->assertInstanceOf(DataObject::class, $result);\n$this->assertDatabaseHas('data_objects', ['ext_ref' => 'test-123']);\n\n// ❌ AVOID\n$this->assertTrue($actual == 'expected'); // Use assertEquals instead\n$this->assertTrue(!is_null($result));     // Use assertNotNull instead\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### ❌ Hardcoded IDs\n```php\n// BAD\n$dataObject = DataObject::create([\n    'object_definition_id' => 1,\n    'customer_id' => 1,\n]);\n\n// GOOD\n$dataObject = DataObject::factory()\n    ->recycle($objectDefinition)\n    ->recycle($customer)\n    ->createOneWithService();\n```\n\n### ❌ Manual Model Creation\n```php\n// BAD\n$user = User::create([\n    'name' => 'Test',\n    'email' => 'test@example.com',\n    'password' => bcrypt('password'),\n]);\n\n// GOOD\n$user = User::factory()->create([\n    'email' => 'test@example.com'  // Only specify what matters for the test\n]);\n```\n\n### ❌ Overriding TestCase Protected Properties\n```php\n// BAD - Will cause errors\nclass MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    protected $customer;  // ERROR: Already defined in TestCase\n    protected $user;      // ERROR: Already defined in TestCase\n}\n\n// GOOD - Use TestCase helpers\nclass MyTest extends TestCase\n{\n    public function test_something()\n    {\n        $customer = $this->getCustomer();\n        $user = User::factory()->create();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Using env() Directly\n```php\n// BAD\n$apiKey = env('API_KEY');\n\n// GOOD\n$apiKey = config('services.api.key');\n```\n\n## Test Execution\n\n**Running tests:**\n```bash\n# All tests\n./vendor/bin/sail php artisan test\n\n# Specific file\n./vendor/bin/sail php artisan test tests/Feature/Services/DataObject/DataObjectService/Create/BasicCreateTest.php\n\n# Specific test method\n./vendor/bin/sail php artisan test --filter=test_update_dispatches_data_object_received_event\n\n# With filter\n./vendor/bin/sail php artisan test --filter=DataObjectService\n```\n\n**Schema regeneration (when migrations change):**\n```bash\n./vendor/bin/sail php artisan schema:regenerate-testing --env=testing\n```\n\n## Examples from Codebase\n\n### Feature Test Example (Integration)\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace

properties\n2. **Check for existing similar tests** to follow established patterns\n3. **Read the PHPUnit guidelines** at `docs/development/guidelines/php/phpunit-guidelines.md`\n4. **Determine test type**: Feature (integration) or Unit (isolated)\n5. **Create proper directory structure** mirroring app/ directory\n6. **Use factories exclusively** with `->recycle()` for multitenancy\n7. **Write descriptive test names** following the convention\n8. **Add PHPDoc** explaining what the test does\n9. **Use named arguments** throughout\n10. **Run the tests** to verify they pass\n11. **Consider creating base test class** if you have multiple related test files\n\n## Final Reminder\n\n- **ALWAYS read TestCase.php first** for feature tests\n- **NEVER override TestCase protected properties**\n- **ALWAYS use factories** with `->recycle($customer)`\n- **ALWAYS use named arguments** for clarity\n- **ALL DataObject changes through DataObjectService** - Never create/update DataObjects directly\n- **Use TestCase helpers for ObjectDefinitions** - `getObjectDefinition()` or `getManagedObjectDefinition()`\n- **Resolve services with `app()->make()`** - NOT `app()` for type safety\n- **Mirror app/ directory structure** in tests\n- **Prefer split over flat** structure for complex classes\n- **Run tests after writing** to ensure they pass\n\n\nYour goal is to create maintainable, readable tests that future developers can easily understand and extend."

Check if `.claude/rules/` already exists (won't overwrite)\n2. Clone the rules repository: `https://github.com/RasmusGodske/laravel-vue-rules`\n3. Set up as git submodule (recommended) or regular clone\n4. Provide guidance on customizing and updating rules\n\n## What Gets Cloned\n\n```\n.claude/rules/                         # Cloned from laravel-vue-rules repo\n├── backend/\n│   └── form-data-classes.md\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── vue-conventions.md\n│   └── component-composition.md\n├── dataclasses/\n│   └── laravel-data.md\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Check Existing Rules\n\nFirst, check if `.claude/rules/` already exists:\n\nUse Bash: `ls -la .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null || echo \"No rules directory found\"`\n\nIf the directory exists:\n- Ask: \"I see you already have a `.claude/rules/` directory. Would you like me to:\n  1. Skip setup (keep existing rules)\n  2. Backup existing and clone fresh rules\n  3. Cancel\"\n\nWait for user choice. If user wants to skip or cancel, stop here.\n\n### Step 2: Ask About Git Submodule\n\nAsk user: \"Would you like to set up the rules as a git submodule (recommended) or a regular clone?\n\n**Git Submodule (Recommended):**\n- ✅ Easy to update (git pull in submodule)\n- ✅ Can track specific version\n- ✅ Clear separation from your code\n- ⚠️ Requires git repository\n\n**Regular Clone:**\n- ✅ Simpler setup\n- ✅ No git dependencies\n- ❌ Harder to update\n- ❌ Becomes part of your project\"\n\nWait for user choice.\n\n### Step 3: Clone the Rules\n\n#### Option A: Git Submodule (Recommended)\n\nIf user chose submodule:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure .claude directory exists\nmkdir -p .claude\n\n# Check if project is a git repo\nif [ -d .git ]; then\n    git submodule add https://github.com/RasmusGodske/laravel-vue-rules .claude/rules\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    echo \"✅ Added as git submodule\"\nelse\n    echo \"⚠️ Not a git repository. Using regular clone instead.\"\n    git clone https://github.com/RasmusGodske/laravel-vue-rules .claude/rules\nfi\n```\n\n#### Option B: Regular Clone\n\nIf user chose regular clone:\n\n```bash\n# Ensure .claude directory exists\nmkdir -p .claude\n\n# Clone the rules\ngit clone https://github.com/RasmusGodske/laravel-vue-rules .claude/rules\n\n# Remove git history to make it part of your project\ncd .claude/rules\nrm -rf .git\ncd ../..\n\necho \"✅ Cloned rules (non-submodule)\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Confirm and Guide\n\nAfter cloning:\n\n**Show summary:**\n```\n✅ Cloned laravel-vue-rules into .claude/rules/\n\nFiles included:\n- backend/form-data-classes.md\n- frontend/vue-conventions.md\n- frontend/component-composition.md\n- dataclasses/laravel-data.md\n- README.md\n\nNext steps:\n1.
