Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files, read them FULLY first\n   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use specialized agents like codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer, pattern-finder\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when searching for different things\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n\n5. **Generate research document:**\n   Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   date: [Current date and time in ISO format]\n   researcher: Claude\n   topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n   tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n   status: complete\n   ---\n\n   # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n   ## Research Question\n   [Original user query]\n\n   ## Summary\n   [High-level findings answering the user's question]\n\n   ## Detailed Findings\n\n   ### [Component/Area 1]\n   - Finding with reference (file.ext:line)\n   - Connection to other components\n   - Implementation details\n\n   ### [Component/Area 2]\n   ...\n\n   ## Code References\n   - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n   - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n   ## Architecture Insights\n   [Patterns, conventions, and design decisions discovered]\n\n   ## Open Questions\n   [Any areas that need further investigation]\n   ```\n\n6. **Save and present findings:**\n   - Check existing research files to determine next sequence number\n   - Save to `thoughts/shared/research/NNN_topic.md` where NNN is a 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.)\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused\n- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns"

Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task description or requirements\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   - Use codebase-locator to find all related files\n   - Use codebase-analyzer to understand current implementation\n   - Use pattern-finder to find similar features to model after\n\n3. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   Based on research, present findings and ask only questions that require human judgment\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\n1. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n2. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n4. **Present findings and design options** with pros/cons\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n```\nHere's my proposed plan structure:\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 sentence summary]\n\n## Implementation Phases:\n1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\nDoes this phasing make sense?\n```\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nCheck existing plan files to determine next sequence number, then write the plan to `thoughts/shared/plans/NNN_{descriptive_name}.md` where NNN is a 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.):\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n[Specification of the desired end state and how to verify it]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected in UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n[Similar structure...]\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific verification step]\n2. [Another verification step]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Review and Iterate\n\n1. Save the plan and present location to user\n2. Iterate based on feedback\n3. Continue refining until satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**: Question vague requirements, identify issues early\n2. **Be Interactive**: Get buy-in at each major step\n3. **Be Thorough**: Include specific file paths and measurable success criteria\n4. **Be Practical**: Focus on incremental, testable changes\n5. **Track Progress**: Use TodoWrite throughout planning\n6. **No Open Questions**: Resolve all questions before finalizing plan"
