Reviews focus on practical, modern accessibility requirements without being overly pedantic.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when the user asks questions like:\n- \"Is this accessible?\"\n- \"Can you review the color contrast?\"\n- \"Check this component for accessibility issues\"\n- \"Does this meet accessibility standards?\"\n- Any request to review, check, or validate accessibility\n\n## Review Process\n\n### 1. Identify the Target\n\nDetermine what needs to be reviewed:\n- Specific component (button, form, modal, etc.)\n- Full page or application\n- Code file or set of files\n- Design mockup or screenshot\n\n### 2. Conduct Manual Review\n\nUse the WCAG checklist in `references/wcag-checklist.md` to systematically review the target against modern accessibility standards.\n\nFocus on the most common and impactful issues:\n- **Perceivable**: Color contrast, text alternatives, semantic structure\n- **Operable**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, interactive elements\n- **Understandable**: Clear labels, error handling, consistent navigation\n- **Robust**: Valid HTML, ARIA usage, compatibility\n\n### 3. Prioritize Findings\n\nClassify each issue as:\n\n**Critical** - Blocks users from accessing core functionality:\n- Missing alt text on meaningful images\n- Non-keyboard accessible interactive elements\n- Insufficient color contrast (below 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)\n- Forms without proper labels\n- Missing focus indicators\n- Inaccessible modal/dialog patterns\n- Auto-playing media without controls\n\n**Warning** - Creates friction but doesn't fully block access:\n- Suboptimal heading hierarchy (skipped levels)\n- Missing ARIA landmarks\n- Link text that's unclear out of context\n- Redundant or unnecessary ARIA\n- Touch targets smaller than 44x44px\n- Missing skip links\n- Non-descriptive error messages\n\n### 4. Stepped Review (One Issue at a Time)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT present all findings at once. Review issues one at a time, waiting for user decision before proceeding.\n\n**4.1 Start with Overview**\n\nBegin by telling the user how many issues were found:\n\n```\nFound [X] accessibility issues ([Y] critical, [Z] warnings).\n\nLet's review them one at a time. I'll present each issue with a recommended fix, and you can decide to:\n- **Fix** — I'll implement the change\n- **Ignore** — Tell me why, and I'll note it\n\nStarting with critical issues first.\n```\n\n**4.2 Present Each Issue**\n\nFor each issue, present ONE at a time using this format:\n\n```\n───────────────────────────────────\nIssue [1/X]: [Critical/Warning]\n───────────────────────────────────\n\n**Problem**: [Clear description of the issue]\n\n**Location**: `file_path:line_number`\n[Show the relevant code snippet]\n\n**Impact**: [How this affects users — be specific about who and how]\n\n**Recommended Fix**:\n[Specific code change or approach]\n\n───────────────────────────────────\nFix this issue, or ignore? (If ignoring, please share why)\n```\n\n**4.3 Handle User Response**\n\n**If user says \"fix\":**\n1. Implement the fix\n2. Confirm: \"Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]\"\n3. Move to next issue\n\n**If user says \"ignore\" with reason:**\n1. Acknowledge: \"Noted — ignoring because: [their reason]\"\n2. Track the decision (see 4.4)\n3. Move to next issue\n\n**If user says \"ignore\" without reason:**\n1. Ask: \"Got it. Quick note on why? (Helps for future reference)\"\n2. Accept any response and move on\n\n**4.4 Track Decisions**\n\nKeep a running tally as you go through issues. After all issues are reviewed, present a summary.\n\n### 5. Final Summary\n\nAfter reviewing all issues, present a summary:\n\n```\n## Accessibility Review Complete\n\n**Reviewed**: [X] issues ([Y] critical, [Z] warnings)\n\n### Fixed ([N])\n- [Issue description] — `file:line`\n- [Issue description] — `file:line`\n\n### Ignored ([N])\n- [Issue description] — Reason: [user's reason]\n- [Issue description] — Reason: [user's reason]\n\n### Remaining Concerns\n[Any patterns noticed, suggestions for future, or issues that were ignored but warrant reconsideration]\n```\n\n## Review Guidelines\n\n**Be Practical**: Focus on issues that genuinely impact users. Modern WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA is the standard—avoid over-engineering or citing obscure edge cases.\n\n**Be Specific**: Reference actual code locations using `file_path:line_number` format when possible.\n\n**Be Constructive**: Provide actionable fixes, not just problems. Include code examples when helpful.\n\n**Consider Context**: Some patterns may have accessibility trade-offs. Acknowledge these and suggest the most accessible approach for the use case.\n\n## Common Patterns to Check\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to activate)\n- Focus must be visible with clear indicators\n- Custom controls need proper ARIA roles and states\n\n### Forms\n- All inputs must have associated labels (explicit or aria-label)\n- Error messages must be programmatically associated with fields\n- Required fields must be indicated clearly\n\n### Color and Contrast\n- Text contrast: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)\n- UI components: 3:1 contrast for interactive elements and their states\n- Don't rely on color alone to convey information\n\n### Images and Media\n- Meaningful images need descriptive alt text\n- Decorative images should have empty alt (alt=\"\")\n- Videos need captions, audio content needs transcripts\n\n### Structure\n- Use semantic HTML (nav, main, article, etc.)\n- Heading hierarchy should be logical (h1 → h2 → h3)\n- ARIA landmarks help screen reader navigation\n\n## Resources\n\nThis skill includes:\n\n### references/wcag-checklist.md\nComprehensive checklist of WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA requirements organized by principle (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust). Reference this during reviews to ensure thorough coverage of accessibility standards."

This skill evaluates animation needs and recommends specific easing curves, durations, and implementation approaches based on interaction frequency and purpose.\n\nEvery animation needs a job. If it has no job, don't animate.\n\n## Process\n\n### Phase 1: Load References (Required)\n\nBefore any recommendations, read both reference files:\n\n1. **Decision Tree** (`references/decision-tree.md`) - Which easing category to use based on the interaction type, plus scale/origin/hover guidance\n2. **Easing Tokens** (`references/easing-tokens.md`) - Specific curves, duration values, and performance guidelines\n\n### Phase 2: Evaluate the Animation\n\nFor each component or interaction, determine:\n\n**2.1 Purpose**\n\nWhat job does this animation do?\n\n- **Responsiveness** - Button press, menu open, immediate feedback\n- **Spatial continuity** - Things come from somewhere and go somewhere\n- **Understanding** - Illustrating a concept, onboarding, marketing\n- **Delight** - Rare interactions only (use sparingly)\n\nIf no clear purpose exists, recommend no animation.\n\n**2.2 Frequency**\n\nHow often will users trigger this?\n\n- **High-frequency / keyboard-driven** - Prefer no animation or near-instant\n- **Medium-frequency / common interactions** - Keep it fast (120-240ms)\n- **Low-frequency / illustrative** - More freedom for slower, richer motion\n\n**2.3 Pattern Type**\n\nWhat kind of motion is this?\n\n- **Enter/exit** - Popover, modal, toast, dropdown appearing or leaving (exits are typically faster than enters—users want things gone quickly)\n- **On-screen morph** - Layout shift, expanding content, repositioning\n- **Time-based** - Progress indicator, marquee, hold-to-delete\n- **Hover/subtle** - Color change, opacity fade, background shift\n- **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys, tab focus, rapid selection\n\n### Phase 3: Recommend\n\nBased on the evaluation, provide specific recommendations using tokens from the reference files.\n\n## Output Format\n\nFor each animation request, provide:\n\n```\n## Animation Recommendation\n\n**Component**: [What's being animated]\n\n### Evaluation\n- **Purpose**: [responsiveness / spatial / understanding / delight / none]\n- **Frequency**: [high / medium / low]\n- **Pattern**: [enter-exit / morph / time-based / hover / keyboard]\n\n### Recommendation\n- **Easing**: [token name] — `[cubic-bezier value]`\n- **Duration**: [token name] — `[ms value]`\n- **Properties**: [transform, opacity, etc.]\n- **Transform Origin**: [if applicable]\n- **Spring vs Bezier**: [recommendation and why]\n- **Bounce**: [yes/no and why]\n\n### Implementation\n[Code snippet or CSS/JS example]\n\n### Notes\n[Any specific guidance for this case]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"How should I animate this dropdown menu?\"\n\n**Response**:\n\n```\n## Animation Recommendation\n\n**Component**: Dropdown menu\n\n### Evaluation\n- **Purpose**: Responsiveness — immediate feedback when user clicks trigger\n- **Frequency**: Medium — common interaction but not rapid-fire\n- **Pattern**: Enter/exit — appearing and disappearing from screen\n\n### Recommendation\n- **Easing**: --ease-out-quart — `cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1)`\n- **Duration**: --dur-2 — `180ms`\n- **Properties**: transform (scale, translateY), opacity\n- **Transform Origin**: Top center (or top-left/top-right based on trigger position)\n- **Spring vs Bezier**: Bezier is fine here; spring useful if menu can be interrupted mid-animation\n- **Bounce**: No — tap-to-open shouldn't bounce\n\n### Implementation\n```css\n.dropdown {\n  transform-origin: top center;\n  transition:\n    transform 180ms cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1),\n    opacity 180ms cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1);\n}\n\n.dropdown[data-state=\"closed\"] {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.96) translateY(-8px);\n}\n\n.dropdown[data-state=\"open\"] {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1) translateY(0);\n}\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Use scale(0.96), not scale(0)\n- Set transform-origin to match trigger position\n- Keep under 240ms for snappy feel\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Be specific about the component** - \"dropdown\" vs \"modal\" vs \"tooltip\" matters\n2. **Mention the trigger** - Click, hover, keyboard, scroll\n3. **Share context** - \"This is a productivity app\" vs \"marketing landing page\"\n4. **Ask about multiple states** - Open, close, hover, disabled\n5. **Specify framework** - CSS, Framer Motion, GSAP, React Spring\n\n## Resources\n\nThis skill includes:\n\n### references/decision-tree.md\nFlowchart for choosing the right easing category based on interaction type. Includes scale values, transform-origin guidance, hover/touch considerations, and accessibility.\n\n### references/easing-tokens.md\nComplete set of easing curves (ease-out, ease-in-out families), duration tokens, and performance guidelines."

This is the voice layer - what TO sound like.\n\n**PRIORITY RULE**: When guides conflict, `references/anti-patterns.md` wins. Avoiding AI patterns always takes precedence over stylistic choices.\n\n**1.2 Understand What Was Built**\n\nInvestigate the codebase to understand the feature:\n\n- Ask which feature or changes they want to write about\n- Use git to check recent commits if relevant (skip if not a git repo): `git log --oneline -10`\n- Read relevant code files to understand implementation\n- Identify key technical decisions, architecture, and interesting details\n- Note any challenges solved or clever solutions\n\n**1.3 Plan the Structure**\n\nPlan what to cover in the post. Use these as a guide, not a rigid template:\n\n- **Opening**: Start with an engaging hook or context for what you built\n- **Overview**: Brief explanation of the feature (2-3 sentences)\n- **Problem/Value**: Why this matters or what problem it solves\n- **Technical Details**: How it works with code snippets\n  - Key implementation details\n  - Interesting technical decisions\n  - Architecture or design patterns used\n- **Challenges**: What was tricky and how you solved it (if relevant)\n- **Future**: Next steps or related features (if relevant)\n- **Tech Stack**: Technologies used (can be woven into the narrative or listed)\n\nThe actual headings, structure, and flow should feel natural to the specific post - not formulaic.\n\n### Phase 2: Writing\n\n**2.1 Draft Creation**\n\nCreate the blog post applying BOTH guides you loaded in Phase 1.\n\n**Code Snippets:**\n- Keep snippets short (5-15 lines)\n\n**Target length**: 500-1200 words depending on complexity\n\n**2.2 Save the Draft**\n\nSave the completed blog post to `.blog/` (create the folder if missing):\n\n**File naming convention:**\n- Format: `.blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`\n- Use URL-friendly slug based on title\n- Example: `.blog/2025-12-29-voice-planner.md`\n\n### Phase 3: Publishing (Optional)\n\n**3.1 WordPress Publishing**\n\nIf the user wants to publish to WordPress, load **WordPress Publishing Guide** (`references/wordpress-publishing.md`) for complete setup and publishing instructions.\n\nThe guide covers:\n- Environment setup and credentials\n- Python dependencies installation\n- Publishing commands and workflow\n- Smart update tracking (no duplicate posts)\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n\nQuick summary:\n- First time: Creates new WordPress draft\n- Subsequent: Updates existing draft (no duplicates)\n- Always saves as draft (never auto-publishes)\n- Returns post URL and edit URL\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter creating and saving the blog post, provide:\n\n1. **Saved Location**: Path where the post was saved\n2. **Post Title**: The final title used\n3. **Suggested Tags**: 4-6 relevant tags for WordPress\n4. **Key Files Referenced**: List of files mentioned with line numbers\n5. **Word Count**: Approximate length\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"Help me write about the voice planning feature\"\n\n**Response**:\n```\nLet me investigate the voice planning implementation to write about it.\n\n[Phase 1: Loads references/anti-patterns.md and references/style-guide.md]\n[Reads relevant files: voice-session.tsx, api/webhook/route.ts, claude.ts]\n\n[Phase 2: Creates and saves blog post applying both guides]\n\nBlog post saved to: .blog/2025-12-29-voice-first-planning.md\n\nTitle: \"Planning Out Loud\"\n\nSuggested Tags:\n- voice-ai\n- elevenlabs\n- anthropic-claude\n- daily-planning\n- nextjs\n- productivity-tools\n\nKey Files Referenced:\n- src/components/voice-session.tsx:78 (voice session initialization)\n- src/app/api/webhook/route.ts:40 (webhook signature validation)\n- src/lib/claude.ts:88 (Claude tool calling)\n- src/lib/github.ts:107 (GitHub atomic commits)\n\nWord Count: ~850 words\n\nWould you like me to adjust the tone, add more technical detail, or publish this to WordPress?\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Be specific about scope**: \"Write about the webhook security implementation\" is better than \"write about webhooks\"\n2. **Mention target audience**: \"For developers familiar with Next.js\" vs \"For non-technical readers\"\n3. **Specify length preference**: \"Quick 500-word update\" vs \"Detailed deep-dive\"\n4. **Share context**: \"This is part 2 in a series\" or \"First post about this project\"\n5. **Request revisions**: After the draft, ask to expand sections, simplify explanations, or adjust tone\n\n## Advanced: Series Posts\n\nFor multi-part series:\n- Start with \"Help me outline a 3-part series about [topic]\"\n- Each post should build on previous ones\n- Include \"Previously\" and \"Next up\" sections\n- Keep consistent structure across posts"

This skill analyzes your notes to identify the most shareable insights, then crafts authentic posts that match your voice and drive engagement.\n\n**Supports macOS Notes integration** - Automatically fetch ideas from your Notes app to draft posts.\n\n## Process\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis\n\n**1.1 Load Writing Guides (REQUIRED - Load First)**\n\nBefore any other work, read ALL THREE reference files:\n\n1. **Growth Principles** (`references/x-strategy.md`) - Content selection criteria, what makes posts shareable, engagement patterns, and what to prioritize from notes. This guides WHAT to share.\n\n2. **Style Guide** (`references/style-guide.md`) - Voice, tone, structure, banned phrases, and signature patterns. This guides HOW to share it.\n\n3. **Anti-Patterns** (`references/anti-patterns.md`) - AI writing patterns to avoid. Critical for ensuring posts sound human and authentic, not AI-generated. Avoid patterns like \"It's not X, it's Y\", formal transitions, hedging language, and AI-specific vocabulary.\n\n**PRIORITY RULE**: When guides conflict, `references/x-strategy.md` wins. Content value and shareability take precedence over stylistic preferences.\n\n**1.2 Understand the Source Material**\n\nGet clarity on what notes to work with:\n\n- Ask which notes, ideas, or updates they want to transform into posts\n- **macOS Notes Integration**: When the user asks to \"look in my notes\" or \"fetch from Notes\", use `scripts/fetch-notes.sh get` to pull content from their configured Notes app note (default: \"Tweets\")\n- Read the source material (markdown files, text, pasted content, or Notes app content)\n- Identify the core insights, learnings, or updates\n- Note any specific tools, projects, numbers, or details mentioned\n\n**Using macOS Notes Integration:**\n```bash\n# Fetch content from default note (configured in .env.local)\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get\n\n# Fetch content from a specific note\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get \"Note Name\"\n\n# List all available notes\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh list\n```\n\n**Multiple ideas/notes workflow:**\n- When the user provides multiple distinct ideas or notes, work through them ONE AT A TIME\n- Create post options for the first idea\n- Wait for user approval/feedback before moving to the next idea\n- This prevents overwhelming the user and allows for refinement as you go\n\n**1.3 Apply Selection Criteria**\n\nUsing principles from `references/x-strategy.md`, evaluate the notes:\n\n- **High Priority**: Shipped features with learnings, non-obvious insights, specific tool recommendations, solutions to common problems\n- **Medium Priority**: Industry takes with unique angles, process improvements with examples\n- **Low Priority**: Generic progress updates, future plans, obvious observations\n- **Skip**: Engagement bait, vague hype, complaints without solutions\n\nFor each potential post, verify:\n- Does it teach something specific?\n- Is it backed by real experience?\n- Would you want to read this if someone else posted it?\n\n### Phase 2: Content Creation\n\n**2.1 Select the Best Angle**\n\nFrom your analysis, identify:\n- **One clear idea** - What's the single most interesting insight?\n- **Specific details** - What names, numbers, or examples prove the point?\n- **The hook** - What's the opening line that makes someone stop scrolling?\n\n**2.2 Choose the Format**\n\nBased on the content:\n\n**Single Tweet** (most content) - Use for:\n- One clear insight or observation\n- Quick ship updates with learning\n- Tool recommendations\n- Strong observations\n\n**Thread (2-5 tweets)** - Only use when you have:\n- A narrative with steps\n- Multiple related insights that build on each other\n- Before/after story with context\n\n**2.3 Draft the Content**\n\nApply BOTH guides loaded in Phase 1:\n\n**From style-guide.md:**\n- Direct, zero fluff - Get to the point in line 1\n- Hook = first line\n- Short sentences (10-15 words max)\n- Specific over generic (names, tools, numbers)\n- Present tense, active voice\n- 180-250 characters (leave room for RTs)\n- Avoid banned phrases (game-changer, unlock, dive in, leverage)\n- Apply casing preference from CASING_STYLE env var (lowercase by default, capitalize personal names and WordPress)\n\n**From x-strategy.md:**\n- Value first - Give readers something useful\n- Show your work - Share process and reasoning\n- Specificity builds credibility\n- One clear idea per post\n\n**Pattern Selection:**\nUse appropriate pattern from x-strategy.md:\n- \"Here's what I learned\" - For insights\n- \"Shipped X, learned Y\" - For updates\n- Specific vs Generic - For challenging assumptions\n- Tool Recommendation - For workflow improvements\n- Problem → Solution - For how you solved something\n\n**2.4 Engagement Optimization**\n\nEnd 70% of posts with engagement:\n- Specific question: \"How do you handle [specific thing]?\"\n- Teaser: \"More on this soon.\"\n- Invitation: \"Curious what you think.\"\n- Hard stop (30%): Let the insight land\n\n**2.5 Quality Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, verify against the three loaded reference files:\n- [ ] Did I get to the point in line 1?\n- [ ] Is this specific? (names, numbers, examples)\n- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?\n- [ ] Does it sound like ME, not ChatGPT?\n- [ ] Did I use any banned phrases from style-guide.md?\n- [ ] Did I avoid AI patterns from anti-patterns.md?\n- [ ] If it's a reaction, did I add MY angle?\n\n### Phase 3: Output\n\n**3.1 Present the Content**\n\nFor each post created:\n\n1. **The Post(s)** - Show the actual tweet(s) ready to copy/paste\n2. **Format** - Indicate if it's a single tweet or thread\n3. **Character Count** - Show length (target: 180-250 chars)\n4. **Pattern Used** - Which pattern from x-strategy.md was applied\n5. **Key Elements** - What specifics, tools, or projects were highlighted\n\n**3.2 Offer Options**\n\nWhen appropriate, provide 2-3 variations:\n- Different angles on the same insight\n- Single tweet vs thread format\n- Different engagement endings\n\n**3.3 Explain Selections**\n\nBriefly note what was prioritized and why:\n- Which insights from notes were selected\n- Why certain details were emphasized\n- What was intentionally left out\n\n**3.4 Save Approved Posts**\n\nWhen the user approves a post, append it to `.social/X.md` at the top level (create if missing).\n\n**File location:**\n- Always save to: `.social/X.md` (top-level, works from any directory)\n\n**Markdown format:**\n```markdown\n---\n\n**Category:** Learning\n**Type:** Single\n**Status:** approved\n**Date:** 2026-01-01\n\nWordPress.com AI adds conversation alongside block editing.\n\nPeople who couldn't navigate the UI before are shipping sites now. Others still use blocks for fine-tuning.\n\nBoth work. The conversation path just removes the skill barrier.\n\n---\n```\n\n**For threads**, use markers to distinguish tweets:\n```markdown\n---\n\n**Category:** Learning\n**Type:** Thread\n**Status:** approved\n**Date:** 2026-01-01\n\n[THREAD - Tweet 1/4]\nWordPress.com AI changes how people build sites.\n\n[Tweet 2/4]\nPeople who couldn't navigate block editing are shipping now.\n\n[Tweet 3/4]\nThe UI is still there for fine-tuning. But conversation removes the skill barrier.\n\n[Tweet 4/4]\nAsk or click. Both paths work.\n\n---\n```\n\n**Categories:**\n- **Learning** - Insights, shipped updates with learnings\n- **Update** - Project progress\n- **Tool** - Recommendations\n- **Observation** - Industry takes\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Present the post(s) to the user\n2. When approved, append to `.social/X.md`\n3. User can copy-paste directly into X (text is ready with proper line breaks)\n4. User removes the section after posting, or asks you to remove it\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter creating social content, provide:\n\n```\n📱 Post 1 (Single Tweet, 210 chars)\n─────────────────────────────────\n[Actual tweet text ready to copy/paste]\n\nPattern: \"Shipped X, learned Y\"\nSpecifics: agents.foo, conversational context matching\nEngagement: Specific question\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom your notes, I prioritized:\n✓ The discovery insight (most shareable)\n✓ Why traditional search failed (specific learning)\n✗ Timeline details (not core value)\n\nAlternative angles:\n• Focus on the technical implementation\n• Thread breaking down the 3 attempts\n```\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"Help me create a post from these notes about building the curation feature\"\n\n**Response**:\n```\nLet me analyze your notes and create X content.\n\n[Phase 1: Loads references/x-strategy.md and references/style-guide.md]\n[Reads the notes, identifies key insights and specific details]\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n📱 Post (Single Tweet, 218 chars)\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nShipped curation v1 for agents.foo today.\n\nDiscovery is way harder than app stores. Agents are conversations, not static features.\n\nHad to rebuild around context matching instead of keyword search.\n\nPattern: \"Shipped X, learned Y\"\nKey specifics: agents.foo, context matching vs keyword search\nEngagement: Implicit (landing the insight)\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom your notes, I selected:\n✓ Core insight: agent discovery is different\n✓ Specific solution: context matching\n✓ Concrete detail: agents.foo\n✗ Number of rebuild attempts (not essential to the insight)\n\nWould you like me to:\n• Save this approved post to .social/ for tracking\n• Create a thread version breaking down why search patterns failed\n• Add a question ending for more engagement\n• Draft additional posts from other insights in your notes\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Provide context**: \"Notes from building curation feature\" vs just pasting notes\n2. **Mention specific parts**: \"Focus on the learning about context matching\" helps prioritize\n3. **Indicate quantity**: \"Create 3 posts from these notes\" vs \"create posts\"\n4. **Specify format preference**: \"Single tweets only\" or \"open to threads\"\n5. **Request variations**: \"Show me a few angles\" gives options to choose from\n6. **Iterate**: After the draft, request adjustments: \"Make it more specific\" or \"Add a question ending\"\n\n## Working with Different Note Types\n\n### Technical/Dev Notes\n- Extract specific tools, frameworks, or technical decisions\n- Focus on the \"why\" behind technical choices\n- Include measurable improvements (time saved, performance gains)\n\n### Personal Observations\n- Find the counter-intuitive angle\n- Add specific examples from your work\n- Tie to practical application\n\n### Meeting Notes\n- Extract actionable insights\n- Skip procedural details\n- Focus on decisions or learnings\n\n### Work Updates\n- Lead with what shipped\n- Include one key learning\n- Make it specific (not \"made progress\")\n\n## Advanced: Batch Processing\n\nFor multiple posts from one set of notes:\n\n1. **Identify 3-5 distinct insights** worth sharing\n2. **Create separate posts** for each (don't try to cram everything)\n3. **Space them out** - Don't post all at once\n4. **Vary patterns** - Use different structures for variety\n5. **Test and iterate** - See what resonates, refine approach\n\n## Remember\n\n**Quality over quantity.** 2 valuable posts beat 10 generic ones.\n\n**Specificity is everything.** Names, numbers, tools, projects - these make posts shareable.\n\n**Your voice matters.** Follow the guides but sound like yourself, not a template.\n\n**Value first.** If it doesn't teach, share insight, or help someone - reconsider posting it."

Reviews focus on practical, modern accessibility requirements without being overly pedantic.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when the user asks questions like:\n- \"Is this accessible?\"\n- \"Can you review the color contrast?\"\n- \"Check this component for accessibility issues\"\n- \"Does this meet accessibility standards?\"\n- Any request to review, check, or validate accessibility\n\n## Review Process\n\n### 1. Identify the Target\n\nDetermine what needs to be reviewed:\n- Specific component (button, form, modal, etc.)\n- Full page or application\n- Code file or set of files\n- Design mockup or screenshot\n\n### 2. Conduct Manual Review\n\nUse the WCAG checklist in `references/wcag-checklist.md` to systematically review the target against modern accessibility standards.\n\nFocus on the most common and impactful issues:\n- **Perceivable**: Color contrast, text alternatives, semantic structure\n- **Operable**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, interactive elements\n- **Understandable**: Clear labels, error handling, consistent navigation\n- **Robust**: Valid HTML, ARIA usage, compatibility\n\n### 3. Prioritize Findings\n\nClassify each issue as:\n\n**Critical** - Blocks users from accessing core functionality:\n- Missing alt text on meaningful images\n- Non-keyboard accessible interactive elements\n- Insufficient color contrast (below 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)\n- Forms without proper labels\n- Missing focus indicators\n- Inaccessible modal/dialog patterns\n- Auto-playing media without controls\n\n**Warning** - Creates friction but doesn't fully block access:\n- Suboptimal heading hierarchy (skipped levels)\n- Missing ARIA landmarks\n- Link text that's unclear out of context\n- Redundant or unnecessary ARIA\n- Touch targets smaller than 44x44px\n- Missing skip links\n- Non-descriptive error messages\n\n### 4. Stepped Review (One Issue at a Time)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT present all findings at once. Review issues one at a time, waiting for user decision before proceeding.\n\n**4.1 Start with Overview**\n\nBegin by telling the user how many issues were found:\n\n```\nFound [X] accessibility issues ([Y] critical, [Z] warnings).\n\nLet's review them one at a time. I'll present each issue with a recommended fix, and you can decide to:\n- **Fix** — I'll implement the change\n- **Ignore** — Tell me why, and I'll note it\n\nStarting with critical issues first.\n```\n\n**4.2 Present Each Issue**\n\nFor each issue, present ONE at a time using this format:\n\n```\n───────────────────────────────────\nIssue [1/X]: [Critical/Warning]\n───────────────────────────────────\n\n**Problem**: [Clear description of the issue]\n\n**Location**: `file_path:line_number`\n[Show the relevant code snippet]\n\n**Impact**: [How this affects users — be specific about who and how]\n\n**Recommended Fix**:\n[Specific code change or approach]\n\n───────────────────────────────────\nFix this issue, or ignore? (If ignoring, please share why)\n```\n\n**4.3 Handle User Response**\n\n**If user says \"fix\":**\n1. Implement the fix\n2. Confirm: \"Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]\"\n3. Move to next issue\n\n**If user says \"ignore\" with reason:**\n1. Acknowledge: \"Noted — ignoring because: [their reason]\"\n2. Track the decision (see 4.4)\n3. Move to next issue\n\n**If user says \"ignore\" without reason:**\n1. Ask: \"Got it. Quick note on why? (Helps for future reference)\"\n2. Accept any response and move on\n\n**4.4 Track Decisions**\n\nKeep a running tally as you go through issues. After all issues are reviewed, present a summary.\n\n### 5. Final Summary\n\nAfter reviewing all issues, present a summary:\n\n```\n## Accessibility Review Complete\n\n**Reviewed**: [X] issues ([Y] critical, [Z] warnings)\n\n### Fixed ([N])\n- [Issue description] — `file:line`\n- [Issue description] — `file:line`\n\n### Ignored ([N])\n- [Issue description] — Reason: [user's reason]\n- [Issue description] — Reason: [user's reason]\n\n### Remaining Concerns\n[Any patterns noticed, suggestions for future, or issues that were ignored but warrant reconsideration]\n```\n\n## Review Guidelines\n\n**Be Practical**: Focus on issues that genuinely impact users. Modern WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA is the standard—avoid over-engineering or citing obscure edge cases.\n\n**Be Specific**: Reference actual code locations using `file_path:line_number` format when possible.\n\n**Be Constructive**: Provide actionable fixes, not just problems. Include code examples when helpful.\n\n**Consider Context**: Some patterns may have accessibility trade-offs. Acknowledge these and suggest the most accessible approach for the use case.\n\n## Common Patterns to Check\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to activate)\n- Focus must be visible with clear indicators\n- Custom controls need proper ARIA roles and states\n\n### Forms\n- All inputs must have associated labels (explicit or aria-label)\n- Error messages must be programmatically associated with fields\n- Required fields must be indicated clearly\n\n### Color and Contrast\n- Text contrast: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)\n- UI components: 3:1 contrast for interactive elements and their states\n- Don't rely on color alone to convey information\n\n### Images and Media\n- Meaningful images need descriptive alt text\n- Decorative images should have empty alt (alt=\"\")\n- Videos need captions, audio content needs transcripts\n\n### Structure\n- Use semantic HTML (nav, main, article, etc.)\n- Heading hierarchy should be logical (h1 → h2 → h3)\n- ARIA landmarks help screen reader navigation\n\n## Resources\n\nThis skill includes:\n\n### references/wcag-checklist.md\nComprehensive checklist of WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA requirements organized by principle (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).

If it has no job, don't animate.\n\n## Process\n\n### Phase 1: Load References (Required)\n\nBefore any recommendations, read both reference files:\n\n1. **Decision Tree** (`references/decision-tree.md`) - Which easing category to use based on the interaction type, plus scale/origin/hover guidance\n2. **Easing Tokens** (`references/easing-tokens.md`) - Specific curves, duration values, and performance guidelines\n\n### Phase 2: Evaluate the Animation\n\nFor each component or interaction, determine:\n\n**2.1 Purpose**\n\nWhat job does this animation do?\n\n- **Responsiveness** - Button press, menu open, immediate feedback\n- **Spatial continuity** - Things come from somewhere and go somewhere\n- **Understanding** - Illustrating a concept, onboarding, marketing\n- **Delight** - Rare interactions only (use sparingly)\n\nIf no clear purpose exists, recommend no animation.\n\n**2.2 Frequency**\n\nHow often will users trigger this?\n\n- **High-frequency / keyboard-driven** - Prefer no animation or near-instant\n- **Medium-frequency / common interactions** - Keep it fast (120-240ms)\n- **Low-frequency / illustrative** - More freedom for slower, richer motion\n\n**2.3 Pattern Type**\n\nWhat kind of motion is this?\n\n- **Enter/exit** - Popover, modal, toast, dropdown appearing or leaving (exits are typically faster than enters—users want things gone quickly)\n- **On-screen morph** - Layout shift, expanding content, repositioning\n- **Time-based** - Progress indicator, marquee, hold-to-delete\n- **Hover/subtle** - Color change, opacity fade, background shift\n- **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys, tab focus, rapid selection\n\n### Phase 3: Recommend\n\nBased on the evaluation, provide specific recommendations using tokens from the reference files.\n\n## Output Format\n\nFor each animation request, provide:\n\n```\n## Animation Recommendation\n\n**Component**: [What's being animated]\n\n### Evaluation\n- **Purpose**: [responsiveness / spatial / understanding / delight / none]\n- **Frequency**: [high / medium / low]\n- **Pattern**: [enter-exit / morph / time-based / hover / keyboard]\n\n### Recommendation\n- **Easing**: [token name] — `[cubic-bezier value]`\n- **Duration**: [token name] — `[ms value]`\n- **Properties**: [transform, opacity, etc.]\n- **Transform Origin**: [if applicable]\n- **Spring vs Bezier**: [recommendation and why]\n- **Bounce**: [yes/no and why]\n\n### Implementation\n[Code snippet or CSS/JS example]\n\n### Notes\n[Any specific guidance for this case]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"How should I animate this dropdown menu?\"\n\n**Response**:\n\n```\n## Animation Recommendation\n\n**Component**: Dropdown menu\n\n### Evaluation\n- **Purpose**: Responsiveness — immediate feedback when user clicks trigger\n- **Frequency**: Medium — common interaction but not rapid-fire\n- **Pattern**: Enter/exit — appearing and disappearing from screen\n\n### Recommendation\n- **Easing**: --ease-out-quart — `cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1)`\n- **Duration**: --dur-2 — `180ms`\n- **Properties**: transform (scale, translateY), opacity\n- **Transform Origin**: Top center (or top-left/top-right based on trigger position)\n- **Spring vs Bezier**: Bezier is fine here; spring useful if menu can be interrupted mid-animation\n- **Bounce**: No — tap-to-open shouldn't bounce\n\n### Implementation\n```css\n.dropdown {\n  transform-origin: top center;\n  transition:\n    transform 180ms cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1),\n    opacity 180ms cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1);\n}\n\n.dropdown[data-state=\"closed\"] {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0.96) translateY(-8px);\n}\n\n.dropdown[data-state=\"open\"] {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(1) translateY(0);\n}\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Use scale(0.96), not scale(0)\n- Set transform-origin to match trigger position\n- Keep under 240ms for snappy feel\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Be specific about the component** - \"dropdown\" vs \"modal\" vs \"tooltip\" matters\n2. **Mention the trigger** - Click, hover, keyboard, scroll\n3. **Share context** - \"This is a productivity app\" vs \"marketing landing page\"\n4. **Ask about multiple states** - Open, close, hover, disabled\n5. **Specify framework** - CSS, Framer Motion, GSAP, React Spring\n\n## Resources\n\nThis skill includes:\n\n### references/decision-tree.md\nFlowchart for choosing the right easing category based on interaction type. Includes scale values, transform-origin guidance, hover/touch considerations, and accessibility.\n\n### references/easing-tokens.md\nComplete set of easing curves (ease-out, ease-in-out families), duration tokens, and performance guidelines."

                "content": "# Technical Writing Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nCreate technical blog posts about features you're building. This skill analyzes your codebase to understand implementations, then structures clear, engaging content that balances technical detail with readability while avoiding AI-sounding language.\n\n## Process\n\n### Phase 1: Research and Planning\n\n**1.1 Load Writing Guides (REQUIRED - Load First)**\n\nBefore any other work, read BOTH reference files:\n\n1. **Writing Rules** (`references/anti-patterns.md`) - Comprehensive lists of AI-sounding words, phrases, and patterns to avoid. This is the foundation - what NOT to sound like.\n\n2. **Style Guide** (`references/style-guide.md`) - Personal writing voice, tone, structure, and signature moves. This is the voice layer - what TO sound like.\n\n**PRIORITY RULE**: When guides conflict, `references/anti-patterns.md` wins. Avoiding AI patterns always takes precedence over stylistic choices.\n\n**1.2 Understand What Was Built**\n\nInvestigate the codebase to understand the feature:\n\n- Ask which feature or changes they want to write about\n- Use git to check recent commits if relevant (skip if not a git repo): `git log --oneline -10`\n- Read relevant code files to understand implementation\n- Identify key technical decisions, architecture, and interesting details\n- Note any challenges solved or clever solutions\n\n**1.3 Plan the Structure**\n\nPlan what to cover in the post. Use these as a guide, not a rigid template:\n\n- **Opening**: Start with an engaging hook or context for what you built\n- **Overview**: Brief explanation of the feature (2-3 sentences)\n- **Problem/Value**: Why this matters or what problem it solves\n- **Technical Details**: How it works with code snippets\n  - Key implementation details\n  - Interesting technical decisions\n  - Architecture or design patterns used\n- **Challenges**: What was tricky and how you solved it (if relevant)\n- **Future**: Next steps or related features (if relevant)\n- **Tech Stack**: Technologies used (can be woven into the narrative or listed)\n\nThe actual headings, structure, and flow should feel natural to the specific post - not formulaic.\n\n### Phase 2: Writing\n\n**2.1 Draft Creation**\n\nCreate the blog post applying BOTH guides you loaded in Phase 1.\n\n**Code Snippets:**\n- Keep snippets short (5-15 lines)\n\n**Target length**: 500-1200 words depending on complexity\n\n**2.2 Save the Draft**\n\nSave the completed blog post to `.blog/` (create the folder if missing):\n\n**File naming convention:**\n- Format: `.blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`\n- Use URL-friendly slug based on title\n- Example: `.blog/2025-12-29-voice-planner.md`\n\n### Phase 3: Publishing (Optional)\n\n**3.1 WordPress Publishing**\n\nIf the user wants to publish to WordPress, load **WordPress Publishing Guide** (`references/wordpress-publishing.md`) for complete setup and publishing instructions.\n\nThe guide covers:\n- Environment setup and credentials\n- Python dependencies installation\n- Publishing commands and workflow\n- Smart update tracking (no duplicate posts)\n- Troubleshooting common issues\n\nQuick summary:\n- First time: Creates new WordPress draft\n- Subsequent: Updates existing draft (no duplicates)\n- Always saves as draft (never auto-publishes)\n- Returns post URL and edit URL\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter creating and saving the blog post, provide:\n\n1. **Saved Location**: Path where the post was saved\n2. **Post Title**: The final title used\n3. **Suggested Tags**: 4-6 relevant tags for WordPress\n4. **Key Files Referenced**: List of files mentioned with line numbers\n5. **Word Count**: Approximate length\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"Help me write about the voice planning feature\"\n\n**Response**:\n```\nLet me investigate the voice planning implementation to write about it.\n\n[Phase 1: Loads references/anti-patterns.md and references/style-guide.md]\n[Reads relevant files: voice-session.tsx, api/webhook/route.ts, claude.ts]\n\n[Phase 2: Creates and saves blog post applying both guides]\n\nBlog post saved to: .blog/2025-12-29-voice-first-planning.md\n\nTitle: \"Planning Out Loud\"\n\nSuggested Tags:\n- voice-ai\n- elevenlabs\n- anthropic-claude\n- daily-planning\n- nextjs\n- productivity-tools\n\nKey Files Referenced:\n- src/components/voice-session.tsx:78 (voice session initialization)\n- src/app/api/webhook/route.ts:40 (webhook signature validation)\n- src/lib/claude.ts:88 (Claude tool calling)\n- src/lib/github.ts:107 (GitHub atomic commits)\n\nWord Count: ~850 words\n\nWould you like me to adjust the tone, add more technical detail, or publish this to WordPress?\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Be specific about scope**: \"Write about the webhook security implementation\" is better than \"write about webhooks\"\n2. **Mention target audience**: \"For developers familiar with Next.js\" vs \"For non-technical readers\"\n3. **Specify length preference**: \"Quick 500-word update\" vs \"Detailed deep-dive\"\n4. **Share context**: \"This is part 2 in a series\" or \"First post about this project\"\n5. **Request revisions**: After the draft, ask to expand sections, simplify explanations, or adjust tone\n\n## Advanced: Series Posts\n\nFor multi-part series:\n- Start with \"Help me outline a 3-part series about [topic]\"\n- Each post should build on previous ones\n- Include \"Previously\" and \"Next up\" sections\n- Keep consistent structure across posts"

This skill analyzes your notes to identify the most shareable insights, then crafts authentic posts that match your voice and drive engagement.\n\n**Supports macOS Notes integration** - Automatically fetch ideas from your Notes app to draft posts.\n\n## Process\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis\n\n**1.1 Load Writing Guides (REQUIRED - Load First)**\n\nBefore any other work, read ALL THREE reference files:\n\n1. **Growth Principles** (`references/x-strategy.md`) - Content selection criteria, what makes posts shareable, engagement patterns, and what to prioritize from notes. This guides WHAT to share.\n\n2. **Style Guide** (`references/style-guide.md`) - Voice, tone, structure, banned phrases, and signature patterns. This guides HOW to share it.\n\n3. **Anti-Patterns** (`references/anti-patterns.md`) - AI writing patterns to avoid. Critical for ensuring posts sound human and authentic, not AI-generated. Avoid patterns like \"It's not X, it's Y\", formal transitions, hedging language, and AI-specific vocabulary.\n\n**PRIORITY RULE**: When guides conflict, `references/x-strategy.md` wins. Content value and shareability take precedence over stylistic preferences.\n\n**1.2 Understand the Source Material**\n\nGet clarity on what notes to work with:\n\n- Ask which notes, ideas, or updates they want to transform into posts\n- **macOS Notes Integration**: When the user asks to \"look in my notes\" or \"fetch from Notes\", use `scripts/fetch-notes.sh get` to pull content from their configured Notes app note (default: \"Tweets\")\n- Read the source material (markdown files, text, pasted content, or Notes app content)\n- Identify the core insights, learnings, or updates\n- Note any specific tools, projects, numbers, or details mentioned\n\n**Using macOS Notes Integration:**\n```bash\n# Fetch content from default note (configured in .env.local)\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get\n\n# Fetch content from a specific note\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get \"Note Name\"\n\n# List all available notes\n./scripts/fetch-notes.sh list\n```\n\n**Multiple ideas/notes workflow:**\n- When the user provides multiple distinct ideas or notes, work through them ONE AT A TIME\n- Create post options for the first idea\n- Wait for user approval/feedback before moving to the next idea\n- This prevents overwhelming the user and allows for refinement as you go\n\n**1.3 Apply Selection Criteria**\n\nUsing principles from `references/x-strategy.md`, evaluate the notes:\n\n- **High Priority**: Shipped features with learnings, non-obvious insights, specific tool recommendations, solutions to common problems\n- **Medium Priority**: Industry takes with unique angles, process improvements with examples\n- **Low Priority**: Generic progress updates, future plans, obvious observations\n- **Skip**: Engagement bait, vague hype, complaints without solutions\n\nFor each potential post, verify:\n- Does it teach something specific?\n- Is it backed by real experience?\n- Would you want to read this if someone else posted it?\n\n### Phase 2: Content Creation\n\n**2.1 Select the Best Angle**\n\nFrom your analysis, identify:\n- **One clear idea** - What's the single most interesting insight?\n- **Specific details** - What names, numbers, or examples prove the point?\n- **The hook** - What's the opening line that makes someone stop scrolling?\n\n**2.2 Choose the Format**\n\nBased on the content:\n\n**Single Tweet** (most content) - Use for:\n- One clear insight or observation\n- Quick ship updates with learning\n- Tool recommendations\n- Strong observations\n\n**Thread (2-5 tweets)** - Only use when you have:\n- A narrative with steps\n- Multiple related insights that build on each other\n- Before/after story with context\n\n**2.3 Draft the Content**\n\nApply BOTH guides loaded in Phase 1:\n\n**From style-guide.md:**\n- Direct, zero fluff - Get to the point in line 1\n- Hook = first line\n- Short sentences (10-15 words max)\n- Specific over generic (names, tools, numbers)\n- Present tense, active voice\n- 180-250 characters (leave room for RTs)\n- Avoid banned phrases (game-changer, unlock, dive in, leverage)\n- Apply casing preference from CASING_STYLE env var (lowercase by default, capitalize personal names and WordPress)\n\n**From x-strategy.md:**\n- Value first - Give readers something useful\n- Show your work - Share process and reasoning\n- Specificity builds credibility\n- One clear idea per post\n\n**Pattern Selection:**\nUse appropriate pattern from x-strategy.md:\n- \"Here's what I learned\" - For insights\n- \"Shipped X, learned Y\" - For updates\n- Specific vs Generic - For challenging assumptions\n- Tool Recommendation - For workflow improvements\n- Problem → Solution - For how you solved something\n\n**2.4 Engagement Optimization**\n\nEnd 70% of posts with engagement:\n- Specific question: \"How do you handle [specific thing]?\"\n- Teaser: \"More on this soon.\"\n- Invitation: \"Curious what you think.\"\n- Hard stop (30%): Let the insight land\n\n**2.5 Quality Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, verify against the three loaded reference files:\n- [ ] Did I get to the point in line 1?\n- [ ] Is this specific? (names, numbers, examples)\n- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?\n- [ ] Does it sound like ME, not ChatGPT?\n- [ ] Did I use any banned phrases from style-guide.md?\n- [ ] Did I avoid AI patterns from anti-patterns.md?\n- [ ] If it's a reaction, did I add MY angle?\n\n### Phase 3: Output\n\n**3.1 Present the Content**\n\nFor each post created:\n\n1. **The Post(s)** - Show the actual tweet(s) ready to copy/paste\n2. **Format** - Indicate if it's a single tweet or thread\n3. **Character Count** - Show length (target: 180-250 chars)\n4. **Pattern Used** - Which pattern from x-strategy.md was applied\n5. **Key Elements** - What specifics, tools, or projects were highlighted\n\n**3.2 Offer Options**\n\nWhen appropriate, provide 2-3 variations:\n- Different angles on the same insight\n- Single tweet vs thread format\n- Different engagement endings\n\n**3.3 Explain Selections**\n\nBriefly note what was prioritized and why:\n- Which insights from notes were selected\n- Why certain details were emphasized\n- What was intentionally left out\n\n**3.4 Save Approved Posts**\n\nWhen the user approves a post, append it to `.social/X.md` at the top level (create if missing).\n\n**File location:**\n- Always save to: `.social/X.md` (top-level, works from any directory)\n\n**Markdown format:**\n```markdown\n---\n\n**Category:** Learning\n**Type:** Single\n**Status:** approved\n**Date:** 2026-01-01\n\nWordPress.com AI adds conversation alongside block editing.\n\nPeople who couldn't navigate the UI before are shipping sites now. Others still use blocks for fine-tuning.\n\nBoth work. The conversation path just removes the skill barrier.\n\n---\n```\n\n**For threads**, use markers to distinguish tweets:\n```markdown\n---\n\n**Category:** Learning\n**Type:** Thread\n**Status:** approved\n**Date:** 2026-01-01\n\n[THREAD - Tweet 1/4]\nWordPress.com AI changes how people build sites.\n\n[Tweet 2/4]\nPeople who couldn't navigate block editing are shipping now.\n\n[Tweet 3/4]\nThe UI is still there for fine-tuning. But conversation removes the skill barrier.\n\n[Tweet 4/4]\nAsk or click. Both paths work.\n\n---\n```\n\n**Categories:**\n- **Learning** - Insights, shipped updates with learnings\n- **Update** - Project progress\n- **Tool** - Recommendations\n- **Observation** - Industry takes\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Present the post(s) to the user\n2. When approved, append to `.social/X.md`\n3. User can copy-paste directly into X (text is ready with proper line breaks)\n4. User removes the section after posting, or asks you to remove it\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter creating social content, provide:\n\n```\n📱 Post 1 (Single Tweet, 210 chars)\n─────────────────────────────────\n[Actual tweet text ready to copy/paste]\n\nPattern: \"Shipped X, learned Y\"\nSpecifics: agents.foo, conversational context matching\nEngagement: Specific question\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom your notes, I prioritized:\n✓ The discovery insight (most shareable)\n✓ Why traditional search failed (specific learning)\n✗ Timeline details (not core value)\n\nAlternative angles:\n• Focus on the technical implementation\n• Thread breaking down the 3 attempts\n```\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"Help me create a post from these notes about building the curation feature\"\n\n**Response**:\n```\nLet me analyze your notes and create X content.\n\n[Phase 1: Loads references/x-strategy.md and references/style-guide.md]\n[Reads the notes, identifies key insights and specific details]\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n📱 Post (Single Tweet, 218 chars)\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nShipped curation v1 for agents.foo today.\n\nDiscovery is way harder than app stores. Agents are conversations, not static features.\n\nHad to rebuild around context matching instead of keyword search.\n\nPattern: \"Shipped X, learned Y\"\nKey specifics: agents.foo, context matching vs keyword search\nEngagement: Implicit (landing the insight)\n\n─────────────────────────────────\n\nFrom your notes, I selected:\n✓ Core insight: agent discovery is different\n✓ Specific solution: context matching\n✓ Concrete detail: agents.foo\n✗ Number of rebuild attempts (not essential to the insight)\n\nWould you like me to:\n• Save this approved post to .social/ for tracking\n• Create a thread version breaking down why search patterns failed\n• Add a question ending for more engagement\n• Draft additional posts from other insights in your notes\n```\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Provide context**: \"Notes from building curation feature\" vs just pasting notes\n2. **Mention specific parts**: \"Focus on the learning about context matching\" helps prioritize\n3. **Indicate quantity**: \"Create 3 posts from these notes\" vs \"create posts\"\n4. **Specify format preference**: \"Single tweets only\" or \"open to threads\"\n5. **Request variations**: \"Show me a few angles\" gives options to choose from\n6. **Iterate**: After the draft, request adjustments: \"Make it more specific\" or \"Add a question ending\"\n\n## Working with Different Note Types\n\n### Technical/Dev Notes\n- Extract specific tools, frameworks, or technical decisions\n- Focus on the \"why\" behind technical choices\n- Include measurable improvements (time saved, performance gains)\n\n### Personal Observations\n- Find the counter-intuitive angle\n- Add specific examples from your work\n- Tie to practical application\n\n### Meeting Notes\n- Extract actionable insights\n- Skip procedural details\n- Focus on decisions or learnings\n\n### Work Updates\n- Lead with what shipped\n- Include one key learning\n- Make it specific (not \"made progress\")\n\n## Advanced: Batch Processing\n\nFor multiple posts from one set of notes:\n\n1. **Identify 3-5 distinct insights** worth sharing\n2. **Create separate posts** for each (don't try to cram everything)\n3. **Space them out** - Don't post all at once\n4. **Vary patterns** - Use different structures for variety\n5. **Test and iterate** - See what resonates, refine approach\n\n## Remember\n\n**Quality over quantity.** 2 valuable posts beat 10 generic ones.\n\n**Specificity is everything.** Names, numbers, tools, projects - these make posts shareable.\n\n**Your voice matters.** Follow the guides but sound like yourself, not a template.\n\n**Value first.** If it doesn't teach, share insight, or help someone - reconsider posting it."
