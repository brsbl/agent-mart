Each workflow file includes:\n\n- **Best Practices** - Production-tested techniques and patterns\n- **Common Patterns** - Real-world implementation examples\n- **Anti-Patterns** - What NOT to do, mistakes to avoid\n- **Production Tips** - Deployment, monitoring, and testing insights\n- **Real-World Examples** - Complete working patterns from live applications\n\nThese insights come from analysis of 89 SignalWire training videos, LiveWire sessions, and production deployments.\n\n## Workflows by Use Case\n\n**Getting Started:**\n- [Authentication & Setup](workflows/authentication-setup.md) | [Number Management](workflows/number-management.md)\n\n**Voice Calls:**\n- [Outbound Calling](workflows/outbound-calling.md) | [Inbound Handling](workflows/inbound-call-handling.md) | [Call Control](workflows/call-control.md)\n\n**AI Voice Agents:** Start with [Voice AI](workflows/voice-ai.md) overview\n- **SDK:** [Basics](workflows/ai-agent-sdk-basics.md) | [Prompting](workflows/ai-agent-prompting.md) | [Functions](workflows/ai-agent-functions.md) | [Deployment](workflows/ai-agent-deployment.md)\n- **Best Practices:** [Patterns](workflows/ai-agent-patterns.md) | [Error Handling](workflows/ai-agent-error-handling.md) | [Security](workflows/ai-agent-security.md) | [Testing](workflows/ai-agent-testing.md) | [Debug Webhooks](workflows/ai-agent-debug-webhooks.md)\n\n**Other:**\n- [Messaging](workflows/messaging.md) | [Video](workflows/video.md) | [Fabric & Relay](workflows/fabric-relay.md) | [Webhooks & Events](workflows/webhooks-events.md)\n\n## Quick Start Patterns\n\n**Authentication:** HTTP Basic Auth with Project ID (username) + API Token (password)\n\n**Space URL:** All API requests go to `https://{space-name}.signalwire.com`\n\n**SWML Variables:** `%{call.from}`, `%{call.to}`, `%{params.custom_field}`, `%{args.user_input}`\n\n**Webhooks:** HTTP POST with JSON (`call_id`, `call_state`, `from`, `to`, `direction`)\n\n**Errors:** REST returns HTTP status + JSON with `error`/`message`. SWML logs to Dashboard.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Call States:** queued → created → ringing → answered → ended\n\n**SWML Sections:** `main` (required entry point) | `execute` (call + return) | `transfer` (goto)\n\n**Resources:** Subscribers, AI Agents, SWML Scripts, Video Rooms, SIP Gateways, Relay Apps (created via Dashboard or REST API)\n\n## Critical Pattern: Loop Protection\n\nSWML gather/prompt nodes can infinite loop. Always add counters:\n\n```yaml\n- set:\n    loop_counter: \"{{loop_counter | default(0) | int + 1}}\"\n- condition:\n    if: \"{{loop_counter}} > 3\"\n    then: hangup  # Prevent caller stuck in loop\n```\n\nFor complete patterns, see [Inbound Call Handling](workflows/inbound-call-handling.md).\n\n## AI Agents SDK Reference\n\n**IMPORTANT:** For AI agent tasks, start with [Voice AI](workflows/voice-ai.md) - it covers 90% of use cases with examples and best practices.\n\n**Only load reference docs for:** Complete API parameters, advanced features (Contexts/Steps, Prefabs), platform-specific deployment (Lambda/GCF/Azure), or debugging production issues.\n\nSee [Voice AI workflow](workflows/voice-ai.md) \"When to Pull Additional Documentation\" section for detailed guidance on when to use each reference document.\n\n## Finding the Right Workflow\n\n**New to SignalWire?** → [Authentication & Setup](workflows/authentication-setup.md)\n\n**Building AI voice agent?** → [Voice AI](workflows/voice-ai.md)\n\n**Making/receiving calls?** → [Outbound Calling](workflows/outbound-calling.md) or [Inbound Handling](workflows/inbound-call-handling.md)\n\n**Debugging webhooks/callbacks?** → [Webhooks & Events](workflows/webhooks-events.md)\n\n**Need real-time control?** → [Fabric & Relay](workflows/fabric-relay.md)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- Main Documentation: https://developer.signalwire.com/\n- GitHub Examples: https://github.com/signalwire\n- AI Agents SDK: https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-agents\n- Dashboard: `https://{your-space-name}.signalwire.com`"
