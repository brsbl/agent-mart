This connects Claude Code to Glean's AI chat interface for enterprise knowledge queries.\n\n## What This Does\n\n- Configures the `glean_chat` MCP server (chat tool only)\n- This is the simplified \"oracle\" mode — just ask questions, get synthesized answers with citations\n- Does NOT include specialized tools (search, email, meetings, etc.)\n\n## Setup Flow\n\n### Step 1: Check Current Config\n\nFirst, check if the user already has Glean MCP configured:\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.claude/mcp.json 2>/dev/null || echo \"{}\"\n```\n\nIf `glean_chat` already exists, inform the user they're already set up.\n\n### Step 2: Gather Information\n\nAsk the user for:\n\n1. **Glean instance name** — Their company's Glean subdomain (e.g., `acme` for `acme.glean.com`)\n\n2. **Authentication method** — They have two options:\n   - **OAuth (recommended)**: Run `/mcp` and select Glean to authenticate via browser\n   - **API Token**: If they have a Glean API token, they can provide it directly\n\n### Step 3: Write Configuration\n\nIf using OAuth (recommended), tell the user:\n\n```\nRun: /mcp\n\nThen select \"Glean\" from the list and authenticate in your browser.\nThis will configure the full Glean MCP.\n\nAfter authenticating, I can help you switch to chat-only mode if desired.\n```\n\nIf using API token, create the config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"glean_chat\": {\n      \"type\": \"sse\",\n      \"url\": \"https://{instance}-be.glean.com/mcp/sse\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer {token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite this to `~/.claude/mcp.json`, merging with any existing config.\n\n### Step 4: Verify\n\nAfter setup, verify the connection:\n\n```bash\n# Restart Claude Code to pick up the new MCP\n# Then test with a simple query\n```\n\nSuggest the user restart Claude Code and test with: \"Ask Glean: Who is my manager?\"\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- The chat-only MCP provides just the `chat` tool — no search, email, meetings, etc.\n- All queries go through Glean's AI which synthesizes across indexed sources\n- Responses always include citations to source documents\n- The user's Glean permissions apply — they only see what they have access to\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| \"Connection refused\" | Check instance name, verify Glean is accessible |\n| \"Unauthorized\" | Token may be expired, re-authenticate via OAuth |\n| \"No results\" | Query may not match indexed content, try broader terms |"

                "content": "# Glean: Your Work Knowledge Agent\n\nGlean is an AI agent with deep context about the user's work — think of it as an oracle for enterprise knowledge. When you're stuck, need background, or want to understand something about the user's company, accounts, colleagues, or work history — ask Glean.\n\n## What Glean Knows\n\nGlean has indexed the user's entire work context:\n\n- **Communications:** Slack messages, email threads, meeting transcripts\n- **Documents:** Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, SharePoint\n- **Code:** GitHub repos, pull requests, commits\n- **People:** Employee directory, org charts, contact info\n- **CRM:** Salesforce accounts, opportunities, contacts\n- **Tickets:** Jira issues, support cases\n- **Meetings:** Calendar events, Gong recordings, Gemini notes\n- **100+ enterprise apps** connected and indexed\n\nGlean synthesizes across all these sources. It doesn't just search — it **thinks** and **answers**.\n\n---\n\n## Core Tool: `chat`\n\n```python\nchat(message=\"your question here\")\nchat(message=\"follow-up question\", context=[\"previous response\"])\n```\n\n### What Chat Does\n\n1. **Understands your question** — natural language, complex queries, multi-part asks\n2. **Searches across all indexed sources** — not just keyword matching\n3. **Synthesizes an answer** — connects dots across documents, conversations, people\n4. **Returns cited sources** — every claim links back to source documents\n\n### Chat Knows Who the User Is\n\nGlean is identity-aware. It knows the authenticated user automatically:\n\n```python\n# These just work — no need to specify the user's name or email\nchat(message=\"What am I working on?\")\nchat(message=\"Who is my manager?\")\nchat(message=\"What meetings do I have today?\")\nchat(message=\"What did I discuss with Jane last week?\")\n```\n\n### What to Ask Glean\n\n**Account & Customer Research:**\n```python\nchat(message=\"Give me an account overview for MongoDB\")\nchat(message=\"Who are the key contacts at Tenstorrent?\")\nchat(message=\"What's the deal status for Sports Facilities Advisory?\")\nchat(message=\"What use cases is Ratio Therapeutics exploring?\")\n```\n\n**People & Org Questions:**\n```python\nchat(message=\"Who works on the agent builder team?\")\nchat(message=\"Who should I talk to about MCP integrations?\")\nchat(message=\"What's Josh Rutberg's background?\")\n```\n\n**Process & Policy:**\n```python\nchat(message=\"How do I escalate a support ticket?\")\nchat(message=\"What's the onboarding process for new accounts?\")\nchat(message=\"How does the AIOM role differ from CSM?\")\n```\n\n**Historical Context:**\n```python\nchat(message=\"What happened in my last meeting with Adam Fowler?\")\nchat(message=\"What was decided about the OCR issue at SFC?\")\nchat(message=\"What's the history of the MongoDB account?\")\n```\n\n**Synthesis & Strategy:**\n```python\nchat(message=\"What are the common blockers for agent adoption?\")\nchat(message=\"What patterns do successful agent deployments share?\")\nchat(message=\"How do other AIOMs handle high-touch accounts?\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Glean's Tools\n\nUnder the hood, the Glean agent has access to specialized tools. You don't invoke these directly — Glean decides when to use them:\n\n| Tool | What It Does |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Search** | Finds documents across all indexed sources |\n| **People Lookup** | Queries the employee directory and org structure |\n| **Email Search** | Searches Gmail with filters (from, to, labels) |\n| **Calendar Lookup** | Finds meetings and calendar events |\n| **Document Reader** | Retrieves full content from URLs |\n| **Code Search** | Searches internal repositories |\n| **Activity Tracker** | Shows what the user worked on recently |\n\nGlean orchestrates these automatically based on your question.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use Glean\n\n### 1. Ask First, Drill Down Later\n\nAlways start with chat. If you need more detail, ask follow-up questions:\n\n```python\n# Start broad\nchat(message=\"What's the status of the Tenstorrent account?\")\n\n# Then drill down\nchat(message=\"What specific use cases are they exploring?\",\n     context=[\"previous response about Tenstorrent\"])\n```\n\n### 2. Be Specific\n\nGlean is smart, but specificity helps:\n\n```\nLess effective: \"Tell me about MongoDB\"\nMore effective: \"What are the current active projects with MongoDB and who are the key stakeholders?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Multi-Turn Conversations\n\nUse the `context` parameter for follow-ups:\n\n```python\nresponse1 = chat(message=\"What meetings do I have with Ratio Therapeutics?\")\nresponse2 = chat(\n    message=\"What should I prepare for the next one?\",\n    context=[response1]\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Trust the Citations\n\nEvery response includes source links. These are real — use them to verify or dive deeper.\n\n---\n\n## When to Ask Glean\n\n| Situation | Ask Glean |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Starting work on an account | \"Account overview for X\" |\n| Preparing for a meeting | \"Prep me for my meeting with X\" |\n| Researching a person | \"What do I know about X?\" |\n| Understanding a project | \"What's the status of X?\" |\n| Finding an expert | \"Who knows about X?\" |\n| Recalling a decision | \"What was decided about X?\" |\n| Writing a summary | \"Summarize my activity on X\" |\n| Investigating an issue | \"What's the history of X issue?\" |\n\n---\n\n## When NOT to Use Glean\n\n| Need | Use Instead |\n|------|-------------|\n| Public/external information | Web search |\n| Local project files | Read tool |\n| Info already in conversation | Reference it directly |\n| Real-time data | Glean indexes periodically |\n| Speculation/opinion | Your own reasoning |\n\n---\n\n## Limitations\n\n**Indexing lag:** New documents may take minutes to hours to appear.\n\n**Permission-scoped:** Glean only sees what the user has access to. If results seem sparse, the user may lack permissions.\n\n**Structured data:** Returns markdown/snippets, not raw CSVs. For full spreadsheet analysis, have the user upload the file.\n\n**External companies:** Glean knows about *the user's company's interactions* with external companies (emails, meetings, CRM data) but doesn't have access to their internal systems.\n\n---\n\n## Examples in Context\n\n### Meeting Prep\n```python\n# Before a customer call\nchat(message=\"Prep me for my call with Adam Fowler at Sports Facilities. Include recent context, open issues, and what we discussed last time.\")\n```\n\n### Account Research\n```python\n# New account handoff\nchat(message=\"Give me a full briefing on the Golden Gate Bridge account — adoption status, key contacts, risk factors, and what the previous AIOM was working on.\")\n```\n\n### Problem Investigation\n```python\n# Debugging an issue\nchat(message=\"What do we know about the agent error Adam Fowler reported? Include request IDs and any support ticket context.\")\n```\n\n### Weekly Planning\n```python\n# Start of week\nchat(message=\"What are my priorities this week based on my calendar, recent activity, and outstanding tasks?\")\n```\n\n### People Context\n```python\n# Before a 1:1\nchat(message=\"What should I know before my 1:1 with Josh Rutberg? Include recent discussions and any items I should bring up.\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nGlean exists to reduce cognitive load. Instead of:\n- Searching Slack, then Drive, then Salesforce, then email...\n- Trying to remember which tool has what...\n- Manually synthesizing across sources...\n\nJust ask Glean. It handles the complexity. You get the answer.\n\nThis is the \"second brain\" pattern — an AI agent with deep context about your work, always available to consult when you need to understand, remember, or decide.\n\n---\n\n*When in doubt, ask Glean.*"

Effective context engineering means understanding what information truly matters for the task at hand and curating that information for maximum signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n**Recognizing Context Degradation**\nLanguage models exhibit predictable degradation patterns as context grows: the \"lost-in-middle\" phenomenon where information in the center of context receives less attention; U-shaped attention curves that prioritize beginning and end; context poisoning when errors compound; and context distraction when irrelevant information overwhelms relevant content.\n\n### Architectural Patterns\n\n**Multi-Agent Coordination**\nProduction multi-agent systems converge on three dominant patterns: supervisor/orchestrator architectures with centralized control, peer-to-peer swarm architectures for flexible handoffs, and hierarchical structures for complex task decomposition. The critical insight is that sub-agents exist primarily to isolate context rather than to simulate organizational roles.\n\n**Memory System Design**\nMemory architectures range from simple scratchpads to sophisticated temporal knowledge graphs. Vector RAG provides semantic retrieval but loses relationship information. Knowledge graphs preserve structure but require more engineering investment. The file-system-as-memory pattern enables just-in-time context loading without stuffing context windows.\n\n**Tool Design Principles**\nTools are contracts between deterministic systems and non-deterministic agents. Effective tool design follows the consolidation principle (prefer single comprehensive tools over multiple narrow ones), returns contextual information in errors, supports response format options for token efficiency, and uses clear namespacing.\n\n### Operational Excellence\n\n**Context Compression**\nWhen agent sessions exhaust memory, compression becomes mandatory. The correct optimization target is tokens-per-task, not tokens-per-request. Structured summarization with explicit sections for files, decisions, and next steps preserves more useful information than aggressive compression. Artifact trail integrity remains the weakest dimension across all compression methods.\n\n**Context Optimization**\nTechniques include compaction (summarizing context near limits), observation masking (replacing verbose tool outputs with references), prefix caching (reusing KV blocks across requests), and strategic context partitioning (splitting work across sub-agents with isolated contexts).\n\n**Evaluation Frameworks**\nProduction agent evaluation requires multi-dimensional rubrics covering factual accuracy, completeness, tool efficiency, and process quality. Effective patterns include LLM-as-judge for scalability, human evaluation for edge cases, and end-state evaluation for agents that mutate persistent state.\n\n### Development Methodology\n\n**Project Development**\nEffective LLM project development begins with task-model fit analysis: validating through manual prototyping that a task is well-suited for LLM processing before building automation. Production pipelines follow staged, idempotent architectures (acquire, prepare, process, parse, render) with file system state management for debugging and caching. Structured output design with explicit format specifications enables reliable parsing. Start with minimal architecture and add complexity only when proven necessary.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nThe collection is organized around three core themes. First, context fundamentals establish what context is, how attention mechanisms work, and why context quality matters more than quantity. Second, architectural patterns cover the structures and coordination mechanisms that enable effective agent systems. Third, operational excellence addresses the ongoing work of optimizing and evaluating production systems.\n\n## Practical Guidance\n\nEach skill can be used independently or in combination. Start with fundamentals to establish context management mental models. Branch into architectural patterns based on your system requirements. Reference operational skills when optimizing production systems.\n\nThe skills are platform-agnostic and work with Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent framework that supports custom instructions or skill-like constructs.\n\n## Integration\n\nThis collection integrates with itself—skills reference each other and build on shared concepts. The fundamentals skill provides context for all other skills. Architectural skills (multi-agent, memory, tools) can be combined for complex systems. Operational skills (optimization, evaluation) apply to any system built using the foundational and architectural skills.\n\n## References\n\nInternal skills in this collection:\n- [context-fundamentals](skills/context-fundamentals/SKILL.md)\n- [context-degradation](skills/context-degradation/SKILL.md)\n- [context-compression](skills/context-compression/SKILL.md)\n- [multi-agent-patterns](skills/multi-agent-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- [memory-systems](skills/memory-systems/SKILL.md)\n- [tool-design](skills/tool-design/SKILL.md)\n- [context-optimization](skills/context-optimization/SKILL.md)\n- [evaluation](skills/evaluation/SKILL.md)\n- [project-development](skills/project-development/SKILL.md)\n\nExternal resources on context engineering:\n- Research on attention mechanisms and context window limitations\n- Production experience from leading AI labs on agent system design\n- Framework documentation for LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI\n\n---\n\n## Skill Metadata\n\n**Created**: 2025-12-20\n**Last Updated**: 2025-12-25\n**Author**: Agent Skills for Context Engineering Contributors\n**Version**: 1.2.0"

                "content": "# Browser Automation Skill\n\nGuidance for effective browser automation in Claude Code. Complements the `dev-browser` plugin.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis skill provides guidance for using browser automation. Requires the `dev-browser` plugin to be installed:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add sawyerhood/dev-browser\n/plugin install dev-browser@sawyerhood/dev-browser\n```\n\n## When to Use Browser Automation\n\n**Good use cases:**\n- Testing local development (localhost, staging)\n- Verifying UI changes after code modifications\n- Debugging visual issues or user flows\n- Extracting data from web pages\n- Automating repetitive browser tasks\n\n**Poor use cases:**\n- Tasks that require authenticated sessions you can't access\n- High-frequency scraping (use APIs instead)\n- Actions on production systems without explicit approval\n\n## Core Patterns\n\n### 1. Persistent Page Sessions\n\nDev-browser maintains page state across interactions. Use this for multi-step workflows:\n\n```\n1. Navigate once to the page\n2. Inspect → identify elements\n3. Interact → click, type, verify\n4. Don't reload unless necessary\n```\n\n### 2. LLM-Friendly DOM Inspection\n\nUse DOM snapshots over screenshots when possible:\n- Snapshots are structured and searchable\n- Screenshots require visual interpretation\n- Combine both for complex debugging\n\n**Pattern:**\n```\nsnapshot → identify element refs → interact with refs\n```\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step for Exploration\n\nWhen exploring unknown pages:\n```\n1. Take snapshot to understand structure\n2. Identify interactive elements\n3. Take one action\n4. Verify result with new snapshot\n5. Repeat\n```\n\n### 4. Full Scripts for Known Flows\n\nWhen you know the exact flow:\n```\n1. Write complete interaction sequence\n2. Execute in one script\n3. Verify final state\n```\n\n## Common Operations\n\n### Navigation\n- `browser_navigate` - Go to URL\n- `browser_navigate_back` - Go back\n- `browser_snapshot` - Get page structure (preferred)\n- `browser_take_screenshot` - Visual capture\n\n### Interaction\n- `browser_click` - Click element by ref\n- `browser_type` - Type into element\n- `browser_fill_form` - Fill multiple fields\n- `browser_select_option` - Select from dropdown\n- `browser_press_key` - Keyboard input\n\n### Waiting\n- `browser_wait_for` - Wait for text/element/time\n- Always wait after navigation or actions that trigger loading\n\n### Debugging\n- `browser_console_messages` - Check for errors\n- `browser_network_requests` - Inspect API calls\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Reference-Based Interaction\nAlways use element refs from snapshots, not CSS selectors:\n```\nsnapshot → find ref=\"btn-42\" → click ref=\"btn-42\"\n```\n\n### 2. Explicit Waits\nAfter actions that cause page changes:\n```\nclick → wait_for text=\"Success\" → continue\n```\n\n### 3. Error Recovery\nIf an action fails:\n1. Take new snapshot\n2. Verify page state\n3. Adjust approach\n\n### 4. Form Filling\nUse `browser_fill_form` for multiple fields:\n```\nfill_form([\n  {name: \"email\", type: \"textbox\", ref: \"...\", value: \"...\"},\n  {name: \"password\", type: \"textbox\", ref: \"...\", value: \"...\"}\n])\n```\n\n### 5. Verification Pattern\nAfter completing a flow:\n```\n1. Take final snapshot or screenshot\n2. Verify expected elements present\n3. Check console for errors\n4. Report success/failure with evidence\n```\n\n## Integration with Glean Workflows\n\n### Testing Agent-Generated Content\n1. Build agent in Glean\n2. Navigate to Glean in browser\n3. Test agent responses\n4. Verify output format and accuracy\n\n### Verifying Customer Deployments\n1. Navigate to customer's Glean instance (if accessible)\n2.
