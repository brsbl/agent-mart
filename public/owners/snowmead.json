Use them when problems require more than surface-level analysis.\n\n<clarification_first>\n## Step 0: Clarify Intent First (MANDATORY)\n\n**ALWAYS start by assessing if clarification is needed.** Before invoking any agents, consider:\n\n- Does the problem have multiple valid interpretations?\n- Are scope, constraints, or success criteria unclear?\n- Could different priorities lead to different analyses?\n\nIf ANY of these apply, use `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE proceeding. Example:\n```\n\"Before I analyze this, what aspects are most important to you?\"\nOptions:\n- Technical accuracy of implementation details\n- Architectural soundness\n- Security considerations\n- All of the above (thorough review)\n```\n\nSkip clarification ONLY when the user's intent is unambiguous.\n</clarification_first>\n\n<available_agents>\n## Available Agents\n\n### atom-of-thoughts\n**Purpose:** Decompose complex problems into atomic sub-questions\n**Invoke:** `Task` tool with `subagent_type: \"atom-of-thoughts\"`\n\nUse when:\n- Questions have multiple parts requiring separate analysis\n- Problems require synthesis from multiple domains\n- Planning complex implementations\n- Debugging issues with multiple potential causes\n\n### chain-of-verification\n**Purpose:** Verify factual claims to reduce hallucinations\n**Invoke:** `Task` tool with `subagent_type: \"chain-of-verification\"`\n\nUse when:\n- Making specific factual claims (dates, numbers, technical details)\n- User asks to double-check or verify something\n- You have low confidence in accuracy\n- Stakes are high and errors would be costly\n</available_agents>\n\n<full_pipeline>\n## Full Pipeline Orchestration\n\nWhen maximum rigor is required, **you orchestrate the full pipeline directly** by chaining agent calls. You are the orchestrator—there is no separate orchestrator agent.\n\n**Trigger full pipeline when:**\n- User explicitly requests thorough analysis (\"be thorough\", \"analyze carefully\")\n- High-stakes decisions (architecture, security, production systems)\n- Complex problems requiring both decomposition AND verification\n\n<pipeline_steps>\n### Pipeline Execution Steps (ALL STEPS REQUIRED)\n\n**Step 1: Clarify Intent** (see Step 0 above)\n\n**Step 2: Decompose with AoT**\n```\nInvoke Task tool:\n- subagent_type: \"atom-of-thoughts\"\n- prompt: \"Decompose this query into atomic sub-questions: {clarified query}\"\n```\n**IMPORTANT:** Display the full atom dependency graph and solutions in your output under \"Phase 1: Decomposition\".\n\n**Step 3: Verify Critical Atoms**\nFor atoms with factual claims or [NEEDS VERIFICATION] flag:\n```\nInvoke Task tool:\n- subagent_type: \"chain-of-verification\"\n- prompt: \"Verify this atom solution: {atom question} → {atom answer}\"\n```\nRun multiple CoVe agents in parallel for efficiency.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize**\nCombine all atom solutions. Use corrected versions where CoVe found issues.\nDisplay under \"Phase 3: Synthesis\".\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification (MANDATORY)**\n```\nInvoke Task tool:\n- subagent_type: \"chain-of-verification\"\n- prompt: \"Verify this synthesized response: {synthesis}\"\n```\n**DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.** The final response must be verified.\nDisplay under \"Phase 4: Final Verification\".\n</pipeline_steps>\n\n<pipeline_output_format>\n### Pipeline Output Format (FOLLOW EXACTLY)\n\n**You MUST use this exact structure for your final output:**\n\n```\n## UltraThink Analysis\n\n### Original Query\n{The user's question}\n\n### Phase 1: Decomposition (AoT)\n\n{Summary from atom-of-thoughts agent}\n\nAtoms identified:\n- [A1] {question} → {answer}\n- [A2] {question} → {answer}\n- ...\n\n### Phase 2: Verification (CoVe)\n\nAtoms verified:\n- [A1] ✓ VERIFIED\n- [A2] ⚠️ CORRECTED: {original} → {corrected}\n- [A3] ✓ VERIFIED\n- ...\n\n### Phase 3: Synthesis\n\n{Combined response using verified/corrected atoms}\n\n### Phase 4: Final Verification\n\n{CoVe summary of synthesized response}\n- Claims checked: N\n- All verified: YES/NO\n- Corrections applied: {if any}\n\n### Final Response\n\n{The verified, high-confidence answer}\n\n### Confidence Assessment\n\n| Aspect | Rating | Notes |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| Decomposition Quality | HIGH/MED/LOW | {notes} |\n| Factual Accuracy | HIGH/MED/LOW | {notes} |\n| Synthesis Coherence | HIGH/MED/LOW | {notes} |\n| Overall Confidence | HIGH/MED/LOW | {summary} |\n\n### Uncertainty Flags\n{Any remaining areas of uncertainty the user should be aware of}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL:** Do not deviate from this structure.
