Present proposed structure to user, wait for confirmation\n   - **(Mode 1 stops here if user just wants to see the plan)**\n\n### Phase 2: Split & Iterate\n\n6. Run split:\n   ```bash\n   python split_module.py split path/to/module.py groupings.json package.module Class1 Class2\n   ```\n7. If imports succeed → done!\n8. **If imports fail → rollback happens automatically**, then:\n   - **Fix `groupings.json`** (add missing items to `base`, adjust groups)\n   - **Re-run step 6**\n   - Repeat until imports pass\n\n### The Retry Loop\n\n```\nsplit → test fails → rollback → fix groupings.json → repeat\n```\n\n**NEVER edit generated files.** They get deleted on rollback. Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

Use when user explicitly asks start-skill-name.\n---\n```\n\nBody lists procedure steps and includes:\n```\n**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT stop between steps. Run all steps skill-name-* in a single turn.\n```\n\n### Phase Pattern (skill-name-N)\n\nEach phase skill:\n- Has description: `Triggered by start-skill-name.`\n- Defines specific task, rules, output format, anti-patterns\n- References previous step's output in conversation context\n\n## Creation Process\n\n### Step 1: Design the Pipeline\n\nDefine phases before creating files:\n1. What does each phase do?\n2. What is the input/output format for each phase?\n3. What rules constrain each phase?\n\n### Step 2: Initialize with Script\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-dir> [--phases N]\n```\n\nExamples:\n```bash\n# Default 3 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py code-reviewer --path skills/public\n\n# Custom 4 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py doc-analyzer --path skills/private --phases 4\n```\n\n### Step 3: Edit Each Phase\n\nFor each generated SKILL.md, replace TODOs with:\n\n1. **Phase description**: What this phase accomplishes\n2. **Rules**: Numbered constraints (keep to 3-5)\n3. **Output format**: Exact structure with example\n4. **Anti-patterns**: What to avoid\n\n### Step 4: Test the Pipeline\n\nInvoke `start-skill-name` and verify:\n- All phases execute without stopping\n- Output formats match specifications\n- Each phase correctly uses previous output\n\n## Example: Gap Finder Structure\n\n```\ngap-finder/\n├── start-gap-finder/SKILL.md\n│   └── Procedure: invoke gap-finder-1, then -2, then -3\n├── gap-finder-1/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Generate raw list of potential gaps (max 20)\n├── gap-finder-2/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Mark each gap CORE or NOT CORE with verdict table\n└── gap-finder-3/SKILL.md\n    └── Task: Output only CORE items with clusters summary\n```\n\nEach phase has strict output format, enabling reliable handoff between phases."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

                "content": "# Skill Spec Generator\n\nGenerate a set of skill specifications that independent skill creators can implement without coordination. Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Run split:\n   ```bash\n   python split_module.py split path/to/module.py groupings.json package.module Class1 Class2\n   ```\n7. If imports succeed → done!\n8. **If imports fail → rollback happens automatically**, then:\n   - **Fix `groupings.json`** (add missing items to `base`, adjust groups)\n   - **Re-run step 6**\n   - Repeat until imports pass\n\n### The Retry Loop\n\n```\nsplit → test fails → rollback → fix groupings.json → repeat\n```\n\n**NEVER edit generated files.** They get deleted on rollback. Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

                "content": "# Skill Spec Generator\n\nGenerate a set of skill specifications that independent skill creators can implement without coordination. Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

Use when user explicitly asks start-skill-name.\n---\n```\n\nBody lists procedure steps and includes:\n```\n**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT stop between steps. Run all steps skill-name-* in a single turn.\n```\n\n### Phase Pattern (skill-name-N)\n\nEach phase skill:\n- Has description: `Triggered by start-skill-name.`\n- Defines specific task, rules, output format, anti-patterns\n- References previous step's output in conversation context\n\n## Creation Process\n\n### Step 1: Design the Pipeline\n\nDefine phases before creating files:\n1. What does each phase do?\n2. What is the input/output format for each phase?\n3. What rules constrain each phase?\n\n### Step 2: Initialize with Script\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-dir> [--phases N]\n```\n\nExamples:\n```bash\n# Default 3 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py code-reviewer --path skills/public\n\n# Custom 4 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py doc-analyzer --path skills/private --phases 4\n```\n\n### Step 3: Edit Each Phase\n\nFor each generated SKILL.md, replace TODOs with:\n\n1. **Phase description**: What this phase accomplishes\n2. **Rules**: Numbered constraints (keep to 3-5)\n3. **Output format**: Exact structure with example\n4. **Anti-patterns**: What to avoid\n\n### Step 4: Test the Pipeline\n\nInvoke `start-skill-name` and verify:\n- All phases execute without stopping\n- Output formats match specifications\n- Each phase correctly uses previous output\n\n## Example: Gap Finder Structure\n\n```\ngap-finder/\n├── start-gap-finder/SKILL.md\n│   └── Procedure: invoke gap-finder-1, then -2, then -3\n├── gap-finder-1/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Generate raw list of potential gaps (max 20)\n├── gap-finder-2/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Mark each gap CORE or NOT CORE with verdict table\n└── gap-finder-3/SKILL.md\n    └── Task: Output only CORE items with clusters summary\n```\n\nEach phase has strict output format, enabling reliable handoff between phases."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

                "content": "# Skill Spec Generator\n\nGenerate a set of skill specifications that independent skill creators can implement without coordination. Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

If imports succeed → done!\n8. **If imports fail → rollback happens automatically**, then:\n   - **Fix `groupings.json`** (add missing items to `base`, adjust groups)\n   - **Re-run step 6**\n   - Repeat until imports pass\n\n### The Retry Loop\n\n```\nsplit → test fails → rollback → fix groupings.json → repeat\n```\n\n**NEVER edit generated files.** They get deleted on rollback. Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

                "content": "# Skill Spec Generator\n\nGenerate a set of skill specifications that independent skill creators can implement without coordination. Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

Use when user explicitly asks start-skill-name.\n---\n```\n\nBody lists procedure steps and includes:\n```\n**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT stop between steps. Run all steps skill-name-* in a single turn.\n```\n\n### Phase Pattern (skill-name-N)\n\nEach phase skill:\n- Has description: `Triggered by start-skill-name.`\n- Defines specific task, rules, output format, anti-patterns\n- References previous step's output in conversation context\n\n## Creation Process\n\n### Step 1: Design the Pipeline\n\nDefine phases before creating files:\n1. What does each phase do?\n2. What is the input/output format for each phase?\n3. What rules constrain each phase?\n\n### Step 2: Initialize with Script\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-dir> [--phases N]\n```\n\nExamples:\n```bash\n# Default 3 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py code-reviewer --path skills/public\n\n# Custom 4 phases\nscripts/init_multi_skill.py doc-analyzer --path skills/private --phases 4\n```\n\n### Step 3: Edit Each Phase\n\nFor each generated SKILL.md, replace TODOs with:\n\n1. **Phase description**: What this phase accomplishes\n2. **Rules**: Numbered constraints (keep to 3-5)\n3. **Output format**: Exact structure with example\n4. **Anti-patterns**: What to avoid\n\n### Step 4: Test the Pipeline\n\nInvoke `start-skill-name` and verify:\n- All phases execute without stopping\n- Output formats match specifications\n- Each phase correctly uses previous output\n\n## Example: Gap Finder Structure\n\n```\ngap-finder/\n├── start-gap-finder/SKILL.md\n│   └── Procedure: invoke gap-finder-1, then -2, then -3\n├── gap-finder-1/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Generate raw list of potential gaps (max 20)\n├── gap-finder-2/SKILL.md\n│   └── Task: Mark each gap CORE or NOT CORE with verdict table\n└── gap-finder-3/SKILL.md\n    └── Task: Output only CORE items with clusters summary\n```\n\nEach phase has strict output format, enabling reliable handoff between phases."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."

Only `groupings.json` survives - that's your source of truth.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# Parse: print definitions JSON\npython split_module.py parse <file.py>\n\n# Split: write files, test imports, rollback on failure\npython split_module.py split <file.py> <groupings.json> <module> <Name1> [Name2 ...]\n```\n\n## Groupings JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"base\": [\"BaseClass\", \"helper_func\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"group_name\": [\"ClassA\", \"ClassAVariant\"],\n    \"other\": [\"ClassB\"]\n  },\n  \"init_extras\": [\"get_instance\", \"create_thing\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Grouping heuristics\n\nApply in order:\n\n1. **Base classes** → `base`: parent is `ABC`/`Protocol`/`BaseModel`, or name contains `Base`/`Mixin`\n2. **Inheritance chains** → same group: class + all subclasses that inherit from it\n3. **Naming patterns** → same group: `FooRenderer`, `FooVLRenderer`, `FooDisableThinkingRenderer`\n4. **Helper functions** → with related class if name matches, else `base`\n5. **Factory functions** → `init_extras`: `get_*`, `create_*`, `make_*`, `build_*`\n\n## Output structure\n\n```\nmodule.py      → re-export stub (backwards compat)\nmodule/\n├── __init__.py   # re-exports + factory functions\n├── base.py       # imports + base classes + shared utils\n└── <group>.py    # from .base import * + group members\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Imports failed. Can I just edit base.py to fix it?**\nA: No. Rollback deletes generated files. Edit `groupings.json` instead, then re-run. That's the whole point of the retry loop.\n\n**Q: Why does rollback exist?**\nA: It protects you. Failed state = broken code in the repo. Rollback restores clean state so you can iterate on `groupings.json` safely.\n\n**Q: cmd_parse didn't capture something (type aliases, constants, etc). What do I do?**\nA: This will happen. When imports fail, read the error, figure out what's missing, and either add it to `base` in groupings.json or fix the script's `parse_definitions()` if it's a pattern you'll hit often.\n\n**Q: What if I need to edit split_module.py to capture new patterns?**\nA: Prefer using `ast-grep` patterns over regex. The script already uses `run_ast_grep()` for classes and functions. Add new patterns following the existing style (see `parse_definitions()`)."

                "content": "# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again"

                "content": "# Skill Spec Generator\n\nGenerate a set of skill specifications that independent skill creators can implement without coordination. Each spec must be self-contained; list-level context explains how specs relate.\n\n## Process\n\n### 1. Analyze Input\n\nInputs vary. Identify what's provided and what needs discovery:\n\n| Input Type | What to Extract |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| Domain description | Core workflows, tools, file types, pain points |\n| Gap analysis | Existing coverage, missing capabilities, overlap risks |\n| Pain points | Repetitive tasks, error-prone steps, knowledge gaps |\n| Workflow description | Sequential steps, decision points, variations |\n| Existing skills list | Patterns, naming conventions, granularity level |\n\nAsk clarifying questions only for critical ambiguities. Prefer generating specs with stated assumptions over excessive back-and-forth.\n\n### 2. Identify Skill Boundaries\n\nGood skill boundaries:\n- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose, describable in one sentence\n- **Natural triggers**: Obvious when to use it (file type, task verb, domain term)\n- **Standalone value**: Useful even if other skills don't exist\n- **Composable**: Can combine with other skills without overlap\n\nWatch for:\n- Skills too broad (should be split)\n- Skills too narrow (should be merged or dropped)\n- Overlapping triggers (will confuse skill selection)\n\n### 3. Generate Specifications\n\nFor each skill, produce a spec block:\n\n```\n## Skill: [name]\n\n**Description**: [Triggering description - what it does AND when to use it]\n\n**Rationale**: [Why this skill is needed, what problem it solves]\n\n**Example triggers**:\n- \"[example user request 1]\"\n- \"[example user request 2]\"\n\n**Expected components**:\n- scripts/: [what executable code, if any]\n- references/: [what documentation, if any]\n- assets/: [what templates/files, if any]\n\n**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [brief justification]\n\n**Dependencies**: [other skills from this list, or \"None\"]\n\n**Notes for implementer**: [any non-obvious considerations, edge cases, or implementation hints]\n```\n\nAdjust detail level based on context:\n- Spec-only request → focus on description, rationale, triggers\n- Implementation-ready request → include full component breakdown\n- Prioritization request → add effort estimates and dependencies\n\n### 4. Provide List-Level Context\n\nWrap the specs with framing that helps skill creators understand the set:\n\n```\n# Skill Specification Set: [theme/domain]\n\n## Overview\n[1-2 paragraphs: what domain this covers, why these skills were chosen, what workflows they enable]\n\n## Coverage Map\n[How these skills relate: sequential workflow? parallel options? layered capabilities?]\n[Visual or textual representation of relationships]\n\n## Priority Order\n[Recommended implementation sequence with rationale]\n\n## Gaps and Future Work\n[What's intentionally excluded, what might be added later]\n\n---\n\n[Individual skill specs follow]\n```\n\n## Output Principles\n\n1. **Self-contained specs**: Each spec should give an implementer everything they need. Don't assume they'll read other specs.\n\n2. **Consistent granularity**: Skills in a set should be roughly similar in scope. Don't mix \"process all documents\" with \"add page numbers\".\n\n3. **Clear triggers**: The description field is the primary trigger mechanism. Make it specific enough to fire correctly, broad enough to catch variants.\n\n4. **Honest complexity**: Skill creators need accurate effort estimates. A \"Low\" skill that actually takes a week erodes trust.\n\n5. **Explicit relationships**: If skills depend on or complement each other, state it. Don't make implementers discover this.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Kitchen sink skills**: Trying to do too much. Split them.\n- **Orphan skills**: Skills that only make sense with others. Either merge or make standalone.\n- **Vague triggers**: \"Use for document tasks\" - too broad, will misfire.\n- **Assumed context**: \"Works with the output of skill X\" without explaining what that output is.\n- **Scope creep notes**: \"Could also do X, Y, Z\" - either include it or don't."
