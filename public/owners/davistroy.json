Map the complete project structure and identify the tech stack\n2. Determine the architectural pattern(s) in use (MVC, microservices, monolith, hexagonal, etc.)\n3. Catalog all external dependencies and their versions\n4. Identify entry points, public APIs, and system boundaries\n5. Trace data flow patterns and state management approaches\n\n## Phase 2: Architectural Assessment\nEvaluate each dimension against industry best practices:\n\n**Structure & Organization**\n- Is there clear separation of concerns?\n- Are module/package boundaries logical and enforced?\n- Is the dependency graph clean or are there circular dependencies?\n- Does the folder structure reflect the architecture or fight against it?\n\n**Code Quality Patterns**\n- DRY violations and copy-paste code clusters\n- God classes/modules that do too much\n- Leaky abstractions and broken encapsulation\n- Inconsistent error handling strategies\n- Mixed abstraction levels within functions/methods\n\n**Security Posture**\n- Hardcoded secrets or credentials\n- Input validation gaps\n- Authentication/authorization patterns\n- Dependency vulnerabilities (outdated packages with known CVEs)\n\n**Testability & Reliability**\n- Test coverage and test architecture\n- Dependency injection vs hard-coded dependencies\n- Mocking boundaries and test isolation\n- Error recovery and resilience patterns\n\n**Performance & Scalability**\n- N+1 queries and inefficient data access patterns\n- Missing caching opportunities\n- Blocking operations in async contexts\n- Resource cleanup and memory management\n\n**Developer Experience**\n- Build/deployment complexity\n- Configuration management approach\n- Local development friction points\n- Onboarding barriers for new developers\n\n## Phase 3: Technical Debt Inventory\nCreate a categorized inventory of all identified issues:\n- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks, production stability threats\n- **High**: Architectural violations that impede feature development\n- **Medium**: Code quality issues that slow velocity\n- **Low**: Style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, nice-to-haves\n\n## Phase 4: Remediation Roadmap\nProduce a prioritized action plan with:\n1. **Quick wins**: Low-effort, high-impact fixes to build momentum (< 1 day each)\n2. **Short-term targets**: Important refactors achievable in 1-2 weeks\n3. **Strategic initiatives**: Larger architectural changes requiring planning\n4. **Long-term considerations**: Major rewrites or migrations to evaluate\n\nFor each item include:\n- Specific files/modules affected\n- Concrete refactoring approach\n- Risk level of the change\n- Dependencies on other remediation items\n- Estimated effort (T-shirt sizing)\n\n## Execution Instructions\n- DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES - ONLY ANALYZE AND PRESENT A DETAILED PLAN\n- Start with reconnaissance and present your findings before proceeding\n- Be specific—cite file paths, line numbers, and concrete code examples\n- Distinguish between \"must fix\" and \"should fix\" and \"could fix\"\n- Consider the project's maturity and team context when prioritizing\n- Identify any architectural decisions that need documentation (ADRs)\n- Flag areas where you need clarification on intent before judging\n\nBegin by analyzing the project structure and presenting an executive summary of the architecture before diving into detailed findings."

This file must follow the structure created by `/define-questions`.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Load and Validate\n\n- Read the specified JSON file\n- Validate it contains the expected `questions` array and `metadata`\n- Load the original source document referenced in `metadata.source_document`\n- Report the total number of questions to the user\n\n### 2. Process Each Question ONE AT A TIME\n\n**CRITICAL: Never batch questions. Never skip ahead. Wait for user response before proceeding.**\n\nFor each question in sequential order by ID:\n\n#### A. Display Progress Header\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nQuestion 12 of 47 | Topic: [Topic Name]\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n```\n\n#### B. Present the Question with Enriched Context\n\nDisplay:\n- **Question:** The original question text\n- **Relevant Sections:** Section(s) from the source document\n- **Context:** The stored context from the JSON\n- **Additional Detail:** Review the original source document and provide supplementary context that helps clarify the question\n- **What You're Solving:** Infer and explain what the user is trying to achieve by answering this question - connect it to the bigger picture\n\n#### C. Provide Answer Options in Multiple-Choice Format\n\nAlways present options in this structure:\n\n```\n**[A] Recommended:** [Your best answer]\n    Why this is best: [Clear rationale - 1-2 sentences]\n\n**[B] Alternative:** [Viable alternative answer]\n    Trade-off: [What you gain/lose with this choice]\n\n**[C] Alternative:** [Another option if applicable]\n    Trade-off: [What you gain/lose with this choice]\n\n**[D] Custom:** Provide your own answer\n\n**[S] Skip:** Skip this question for now (can return later)\n\nYour choice (A/B/C/D/S):\n```\n\nGuidelines for generating answers:\n- Make answers **specific and actionable**, not generic\n- Base recommendations on best practices, the source document's goals, and practical implementation considerations\n- Explain trade-offs honestly - no option is perfect\n- If the question has an objectively correct answer, still offer alternatives that might fit different constraints (budget, timeline, scope)\n- For subjective questions, acknowledge that preferences may vary\n\n#### D. Wait for User Response\n\n- Do not proceed until the user provides input\n- Accept: A, B, C, D, S, or the full answer text\n- If user selects D (Custom), prompt them to type their answer\n- If user selects S (Skip), mark as skipped and continue\n- If user wants to revisit a previous question, allow it (e.g., \"go back to question 5\")\n\n#### E. Confirm and Record\n\n- Briefly confirm the recorded answer\n- Proceed to the next question\n\n### 3. Handle Special Commands\n\nDuring the session, support these commands:\n- `back` or `previous` - Return to the previous question\n- `go to [N]` - Jump to question N\n- `skip` - Skip current question\n- `progress` - Show summary of answered/skipped/remaining\n- `save` - Save current progress to a partial file\n- `quit` - Save progress and exit (can resume later)\n\n### 4. After All Questions Are Answered\n\n#### A. Handle Skipped Questions\n\nIf any questions were skipped:\n```\nYou skipped 3 questions. Would you like to:\n[A] Answer them now\n[B] Leave them unanswered\n[C] Review the list first\n```\n\n#### B. Generate Output JSON\n\nCreate a file with this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"topic\": \"Original topic from questions file\",\n      \"sections\": [\"Original sections from questions file\"],\n      \"question\": \"Original question text\",\n      \"context\": \"Original context from questions file\",\n      \"selected_answer\": \"The answer the user selected or provided\",\n      \"answer_type\": \"recommended | alternative | custom | skipped\",\n      \"answered_at\": \"2026-01-10T14:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"source_questions_file\": \"questions-PRD-20260110.json\",\n    \"source_document\": \"PRD.md\",\n    \"total_questions\": 47,\n    \"started_at\": \"2026-01-10T14:00:00Z\",\n    \"completed_at\": \"2026-01-10T15:30:00Z\",\n    \"answer_summary\": {\n      \"recommended\": 35,\n      \"alternative\": 8,\n      \"custom\": 4,\n      \"skipped\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### C. Save the File\n\nSave as `answers-[source-document]-[timestamp].json` in the repository root.\n\nExample: `answers-PRD-20260110-143052.json`\n\n#### D. Display Completion Summary\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSession Complete!\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nTotal Questions: 47\n- Recommended answers selected: 35 (74%)\n- Alternative answers selected: 8 (17%)\n- Custom answers provided: 4 (9%)\n- Skipped: 0 (0%)\n\nSaved to: answers-PRD-20260110-143052.json\n\nThis file can be used to:\n- Update your source document with decisions made\n- Share decisions with stakeholders\n- Track rationale for future reference\n```\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. **ONE AT A TIME** - This is critical. Never show multiple questions at once.\n2. **Always wait for input** - Do not auto-advance or assume answers.\n3. **Reference the source** - Always consult the original document for context.\n4. **Specific answers** - Generic answers like \"it depends\" are not acceptable. Commit to recommendations.\n5. **Maintain state** - Track progress so users can pause and resume.\n6. **Conversational tone** - Be helpful and encouraging, especially for long sessions.\n7. **Respect user choice** - If they prefer an alternative or custom answer, don't push back.\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nQuestion 3 of 32 | Topic: LLM Integration\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n**Question:** Which LLM provider(s) should be used for the AI board members and transcription services?\n\n**Relevant Sections:** 5.1 Technical Architecture, 3.2 AI Services\n\n**Context:** The PRD references LLM services for voice transcription and AI board member responses but does not specify providers. This affects API integration, cost modeling, and capability constraints.\n\n**Additional Detail:** Your PRD emphasizes privacy and data security (Section 7.1), mentions the need for consistent personality in AI board members (Section 3.1), and targets a $9.99/month price point. The transcription service needs to handle voice memos up to 5 minutes.\n\n**What You're Solving:** You need to select infrastructure that balances cost, capability, and privacy while ensuring the AI board members can maintain consistent, high-quality personas across sessions.\n\n---\n\n**[A] Recommended:** Use Claude (Anthropic) for AI board members + Deepgram for transcription\n    Why this is best: Claude excels at maintaining consistent personas and nuanced conversation. Deepgram offers accurate, cost-effective transcription with good privacy practices. Combined cost fits your margin at scale.\n\n**[B] Alternative:** Use GPT-4 (OpenAI) for both AI and transcription (Whisper)\n    Trade-off: Single vendor simplifies integration but higher cost per request. Whisper is excellent but OpenAI's data practices may conflict with privacy emphasis.\n\n**[C] Alternative:** Use Claude for AI + AssemblyAI for transcription\n    Trade-off: AssemblyAI has strong accuracy and real-time features, but adds another vendor relationship. Good middle-ground on privacy.\n\n**[D] Custom:** Provide your own answer\n\n**[S] Skip:** Skip this question for now\n\nYour choice (A/B/C/D/S):\n```\n\nUser types: `A`\n\n```\nRecorded: Claude (Anthropic) for AI board members + Deepgram for transcription\n\nProceeding to question 4...\n```"

Execute each phase systematically.\n\n## Phase 1: Artifact Cleanup\n\nIdentify and remove files that should not be in the repository:\n\n### Temporary Files\n- `**/tmp*`, `**/*.tmp`, `**/*.temp`\n- `**/tmpclaude-*`, `**/*.bak`, `**/*.swp`, `**/*.swo`\n- `**/*~`, `**/*.orig`, `**/*.pyc`, `**/*.pyo`\n- `**/__pycache__/`, `**/.cache/`, `**/node_modules/.cache/`\n- `**/nul`, `**/NUL` (Windows artifacts)\n\n### Build Artifacts (if not gitignored)\n- `**/dist/`, `**/build/`, `**/out/`\n- `**/*.log`, `**/logs/`\n- `**/.next/`, `**/.nuxt/`, `**/.output/`\n\n### IDE/Editor Artifacts (if not gitignored)\n- `**/.idea/`, `**/.vscode/` (unless intentionally committed)\n- `**/*.iml`, `**/.project`, `**/.classpath`\n\n### OS Artifacts\n- `**/.DS_Store`, `**/Thumbs.db`, `**/desktop.ini`\n\n**Actions:**\n1. List all suspected artifacts found\n2. Check `.gitignore` - add missing patterns if appropriate\n3. Remove untracked artifacts from working directory\n4. For tracked artifacts that shouldn't be: stage removal and note for commit\n\n## Phase 2: Structure Validation\n\nVerify the repository structure follows conventions:\n\n### Standard Files in Root\nCheck for presence and proper location of:\n- `README.md` - Must exist in root\n- `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` - Should exist for open source\n- `.gitignore` - Should exist and be comprehensive\n- `CHANGELOG.md` - Recommended for versioned projects\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Recommended for collaborative projects\n\n### Framework-Specific Structure\nDetect the project type and validate structure:\n- **Node.js**: `package.json` in root, source in `src/` or root\n- **Python**: `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` in root, source in `src/` or package dir\n- **Claude Code Plugin**: `.claude-plugin/` or `.claude/commands/` structure\n- **Monorepo**: `packages/` or `apps/` with proper workspace config\n\n### Misplaced Files\nLook for:\n- Source files in root that belong in `src/`\n- Config files in wrong locations\n- Documentation scattered instead of in `docs/`\n- Test files outside of `tests/` or `__tests__/`\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Report structural issues found\n2. Propose file moves if needed (confirm before executing)\n3. Note any missing standard files\n\n## Phase 3: Documentation Audit\n\n### README.md Validation\nVerify README contains:\n- [ ] Project name and clear description\n- [ ] Installation/setup instructions\n- [ ] Basic usage examples\n- [ ] Link to more detailed docs (if they exist)\n- [ ] License mention\n- [ ] Accurate information (no stale references)\n\nCheck for issues:\n- References to old project names, URLs, or paths\n- Outdated version numbers or dependencies\n- Broken links (internal and external)\n- Missing or outdated badges\n\n### CLAUDE.md Validation (if exists)\nVerify CLAUDE.md follows best practices:\n- [ ] Concise project overview\n- [ ] Accurate repository structure documentation\n- [ ] Key commands and workflows\n- [ ] Conventions and patterns used\n- [ ] No redundant or obvious instructions\n\nCheck for issues:\n- Structure documentation doesn't match actual structure\n- References to non-existent files or directories\n- Outdated conventions or patterns\n- Excessive verbosity or filler content\n\n### Other Documentation\n- Check `docs/` folder contents are current\n- Verify inline code comments match implementation\n- Check for TODO/FIXME comments that are stale\n\n## Phase 4: Configuration Consistency\n\n### Package Metadata\nFor projects with package files, verify:\n- `name` field matches project identity\n- `description` is accurate and helpful\n- `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs` URLs are correct\n- `version` follows semver and is current\n- `author`/`contributors` information is accurate\n\n### Cross-File Consistency\nCheck that these match across files:\n- Project name (README, package.json, CLAUDE.md, etc.)\n- Version numbers\n- Repository URLs\n- Author/maintainer information\n\n## Phase 5: Git Hygiene\n\n### Branch Cleanup\n- Identify merged branches that can be deleted\n- Check for stale remote tracking branches\n\n### Gitignore Completeness\nEnsure `.gitignore` includes:\n- Language-specific artifacts\n- IDE/editor files\n- OS-specific files\n- Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`)\n- Build outputs\n- Dependency directories\n\n## Execution Instructions\n\n1. **Scan first, act second** - Complete all phases of analysis before making changes\n2. **Present findings** - Show a summary of all issues found, categorized by severity\n3. **Propose changes** - List specific changes to be made\n4. **Confirm before bulk operations** - Get user approval before:\n   - Deleting multiple files\n   - Moving files to new locations\n   - Updating multiple documentation files\n5. **Make changes incrementally** - Execute approved changes, showing progress\n6. **Summarize results** - Report what was cleaned, moved, updated, and any remaining items\n\n## Output Format\n\n### Initial Report\n```\n## Repository Cleanup Report\n\n### Artifacts Found\n- [X files] Temporary files\n- [X files] Build artifacts\n- [X files] OS/IDE artifacts\n\n### Structure Issues\n- [List of misplaced or missing files]\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- [List of outdated or missing documentation]\n\n### Configuration Issues\n- [List of inconsistencies]\n\n### Recommended Actions\n1.

Read and analyze that document thoroughly.\n\n2. **Identify all questions and open items** - Look for:\n   - Explicit questions (sentences ending with `?`)\n   - Open items marked with \"TBD\", \"TODO\", \"TBC\", or similar markers\n   - Incomplete sections or placeholders\n   - Areas marked as needing review or decision\n   - Gaps in specifications or requirements\n   - Ambiguous or vague statements that need clarification\n   - Missing details that would be needed for implementation\n   - Dependencies or prerequisites that are undefined\n   - Edge cases or scenarios not addressed\n\n3. **Create a JSON file** with the following structure for each question/open item:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"topic\": \"Best guess at the topic area (e.g., 'User Authentication', 'Data Model', 'Integration')\",\n      \"sections\": [\"Section name or header where this question is relevant\"],\n      \"question\": \"The actual question or open item that needs clarification\",\n      \"context\": \"Any relevant information, background, or details needed to understand and properly answer this question\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"source_document\": \"Name of the analyzed document\",\n    \"total_questions\": 0,\n    \"generated_date\": \"ISO date string\",\n    \"topics_summary\": [\"List of unique topics identified\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Assign sequential IDs** starting from 1 for each question.\n\n5. **Categorize by topic** - Group related questions under logical topic areas based on the content (e.g., \"Technical Architecture\", \"User Experience\", \"Business Logic\", \"Data Management\", \"Integration\", \"Security\", \"Performance\", etc.).\n\n6. **Reference relevant sections** - For each question, note which section(s) of the document it relates to. Use the exact section headers/titles from the document.\n\n7. **Provide rich context** - For each question, include enough context so that someone unfamiliar with the document could understand:\n   - Why this question matters\n   - What information is currently available\n   - What specific details are missing or unclear\n   - Any constraints or requirements that affect the answer\n\n8. **Save the output** - Write the JSON file to a new file named `questions-[document-name]-[timestamp].json` in the repository root. Use a timestamp format like `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.\n\n9. **Report the results** - After creating the file, provide a summary to the user including:\n   - Total number of questions identified\n   - Breakdown by topic area\n   - The file path where the JSON was saved\n\n## Example Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"topic\": \"Board Role Definitions\",\n      \"sections\": [\"3.1 AI Board Members\", \"4.2 Governance Sessions\"],\n      \"question\": \"What specific expertise and personality traits should each of the 5 AI board member roles embody?\",\n      \"context\": \"The PRD mentions a 5-role AI board for career governance but does not define the specific roles, their areas of expertise, how they should interact with each other, or their individual decision-making styles.

Execute the following systematic process:\n\n## Phase 1: Discovery\n1. Map the entire project structure to understand the codebase architecture\n2. Identify ALL documentation touchpoints:\n   - README files (root and subdirectories)\n   - Inline code comments\n   - Docstrings/JSDoc/type annotations\n   - API documentation\n   - Configuration file comments\n   - CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE files\n   - Doc folders (/docs, /documentation, etc.)\n   - Package.json descriptions, setup.py metadata, etc.\n\n## Phase 2: Analysis\nFor each file in the project, evaluate:\n- Does the code behavior match its documentation?\n- Are there undocumented functions, classes, modules, or exports?\n- Are examples/usage snippets still accurate and runnable?\n- Are dependencies and version requirements current?\n- Is terminology consistent across all docs?\n- Are there dead links or references to removed code?\n\n## Phase 3: Remediation\nApply these updates:\n1. **Accuracy**: Fix any documentation that contradicts actual code behavior\n2. **Completeness**: Add missing docstrings, parameter descriptions, return types, and usage examples\n3. **Clarity**: Rewrite confusing explanations; break up walls of text\n4. **Consistency**: Standardize formatting, heading styles, and terminology\n5. **Currency**: Update version numbers, deprecation notices, and outdated patterns\n6. **Cleanup**: Remove commented-out code, stale TODOs, and redundant documentation\n\n## Execution Rules\n- Work file-by-file, showing me what you're changing and why\n- Preserve the project's existing documentation style and voice\n- Prioritize high-impact files (main README, public APIs) first\n- For large projects, batch by directory and confirm before proceeding to the next\n- Create missing documentation files if the project lacks them (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)\n- If you find significant architectural decisions that should be documented, note them\n\n## Phase 4: CLAUDE.md Optimization\n\nAfter completing the general documentation review, perform a detailed evaluation and refactor of the project's CLAUDE.md file:\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\n1. **Structure**: Does it follow best practices? (project overview → key commands → architecture → conventions)\n2. **Conciseness**: Is every line earning its place? Remove filler words and redundant explanations\n3. **Actionability**: Are instructions specific and useful for Claude Code, or generic boilerplate?\n4. **Duplication**: Identify and eliminate repeated information across sections\n5. **Coherence**: Does information flow logically? Are related topics grouped together?\n6. **Relevance**: Remove outdated info, dead links, or references to non-existent files/features\n\n### Refactoring Guidelines\n- **Merge overlapping sections** - Combine related guidance into single coherent blocks\n- **Use terse, imperative language** - \"Use X for Y\" not \"When you need to do Y, you should consider using X\"\n- **Prefer lists over prose** - Bullets and tables scan faster than paragraphs\n- **Cut meta-commentary** - Remove \"This section describes...\" type filler\n- **Consolidate commands** - Group related shell commands, don't scatter them\n- **Eliminate obvious instructions** - Don't tell Claude to \"read files\" or \"understand code\"\n- **Keep domain knowledge** - Preserve project-specific terminology, stakeholders, and context that Claude wouldn't know otherwise\n\n### Output\nPresent a before/after comparison showing:\n1. Issues identified (with line references)\n2. Proposed refactored CLAUDE.md\n3. Summary of changes made and bytes/lines reduced\n\nBegin by scanning the project structure and presenting your documentation audit plan before making changes."

Type 'start' to proceed or 'preview' to see all questions first.\n```\n\nWait for user confirmation before proceeding.\n\n## Phase 2: Interactive Q&A Session\n\nExecute the logic from `/ask-questions`:\n\n### 2.1 Question Flow\n\nFor each question, present:\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nQuestion 3 of 15 | Topic: [Topic Name]\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n**Question:** [The question text]\n\n**Location:** Line [X] in section \"[Section Name]\"\n**Original text:** \"[The TBD or question as it appears in the document]\"\n\n**Context:** [Background from the JSON]\n\n**What You're Solving:** [Inferred goal]\n\n---\n\n**[A] Recommended:** [Best answer]\n    Why: [Rationale]\n\n**[B] Alternative:** [Other option]\n    Trade-off: [What changes]\n\n**[C] Alternative:** [Another option if applicable]\n    Trade-off: [What changes]\n\n**[D] Custom:** Provide your own answer\n\n**[S] Skip:** Skip for now\n\nYour choice (A/B/C/D/S):\n```\n\n### 2.2 Auto Mode Behavior\nIf `--auto` flag was provided:\n- Auto-select option A (Recommended) for each question\n- Show what was selected but don't wait for input\n- User can interrupt with `pause` to switch to interactive mode\n\n### 2.3 Session Commands\nSupport during Q&A:\n- `back` / `previous` — Return to previous question\n- `go to [N]` — Jump to question N\n- `skip` — Skip current question\n- `progress` — Show answered/skipped/remaining\n- `pause` — (Auto mode) Switch to interactive\n- `auto` — (Interactive mode) Switch to auto for remaining questions\n\n### 2.4 Save Answers\nAfter all questions are answered (or skipped), save to:\n`reference/answers-[document-name]-[timestamp].json`\n\nStructure:\n```json\n{\n  \"answers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"question\": \"Original question\",\n      \"location\": {\n        \"line_start\": 45,\n        \"line_end\": 45,\n        \"original_text\": \"TBD: Define the authentication method\"\n      },\n      \"selected_answer\": \"Use OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens\",\n      \"answer_type\": \"recommended | alternative | custom | skipped\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"source_document\": \"PRD.md\",\n    \"questions_file\": \"reference/questions-PRD-20260111-143052.json\",\n    \"total_questions\": 15,\n    \"answered\": 14,\n    \"skipped\": 1,\n    \"completed_at\": \"ISO date\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 3: Document Update\n\n### 3.1 Create Backup\nBefore any modifications:\n1. Copy original document to backup: `[name].backup-[timestamp].md`\n2. Confirm backup was created successfully\n\nExample: `PRD.md` → `PRD.backup-20260111-150000.md`\n\n### 3.2 Apply Updates\nFor each answered question (not skipped):\n\n**For TBD/TODO markers:**\n- Find the original text using `location` data\n- Replace the TBD/placeholder with the answer\n- Preserve surrounding formatting\n\nExample:\n```markdown\n# Before\nAuthentication method: TBD\n\n# After\nAuthentication method: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for stateless session management\n```\n\n**For questions in the text:**\n- Replace the question with a statement incorporating the answer\n- Or add the answer immediately after the question\n\n**For gaps/missing sections:**\n- Add new content at the appropriate location\n- Use document's existing style and formatting\n\n### 3.3 Add Resolution Summary\nAt the end of the document (or in a dedicated section), optionally add:\n\n```markdown\n---\n\n## Document Resolution Log\n\n*This document was completed on [date] using `/finish-document`.*\n\n**Questions Resolved:** 14 of 15\n**Reference Files:**\n- Questions: `reference/questions-PRD-20260111-143052.json`\n- Answers: `reference/answers-PRD-20260111-150030.json`\n- Original backup: `PRD.backup-20260111-150000.md`\n```\n\nAsk user if they want this summary included.\n\n### 3.4 Save Updated Document\nSave to the original filename (e.g., `PRD.md`).\n\n### 3.5 Handle Skipped Questions\nIf any questions were skipped:\n- Leave original TBD/question text in place\n- Optionally mark with a comment: `<!-- UNRESOLVED: [question] -->`\n- Report skipped items in final summary\n\n## Final Report\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nDocument Complete!\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n**Document:** PRD.md (updated)\n**Backup:** PRD.backup-20260111-150000.md\n\n**Questions Resolved:** 14 of 15\n- Recommended answers: 10\n- Alternative answers: 2\n- Custom answers: 2\n- Skipped: 1\n\n**Reference Files:**\n- reference/questions-PRD-20260111-143052.json\n- reference/answers-PRD-20260111-150030.json\n\n**Skipped Questions:**\n- Q7: \"What is the data retention policy?\" (Section: Compliance)\n\nYou can re-run `/finish-document PRD.md` to address skipped questions.\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Document not found:** Report error and exit\n- **No questions found:** Report that document appears complete, offer to do a deeper analysis\n- **Backup failed:** Abort before making changes\n- **Parse error:** Report location and skip that update, continue with others\n- **User quits mid-session:** Save progress, allow resume with `--resume` flag\n\n## Safety Rules\n\n1. **Always backup first** — Never modify original without successful backup\n2. **Preserve formatting** — Match the document's existing style\n3. **Don't lose content** — If unsure where to place an answer, append rather than replace\n4. **Keep references** — Never delete the questions/answers JSON files automatically\n5. **Atomic updates** — If document update fails partway, restore from backup"
