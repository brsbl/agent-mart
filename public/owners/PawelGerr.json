                "content": "# Awesome Thinking: Sequential Reflective Thinking Framework\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nThis skill provides a structured approach to complex problem-solving through sequential, reflective thinking. It enables systematic exploration of problems where understanding deepens progressively, assumptions may need revision, and multiple solution paths should be considered.\r\n\r\nUnlike linear problem-solving, this framework embraces:\r\n- Dynamic adjustment of solution complexity as understanding evolves\r\n- Questioning and revising previous conclusions when new insights emerge\r\n- Branching into alternative approaches when uncertainty exists\r\n- Iterative hypothesis generation and verification until a satisfactory solution is reached\r\n\r\n## When to Use This Skill\r\n\r\nInvoke this skill for:\r\n\r\n- **Complex multi-step problems** requiring careful breakdown and analysis\r\n- **Problems with unclear scope** where initial estimates may need adjustment\r\n- **Scenarios requiring course correction** as new information emerges\r\n- **Architectural or design decisions** with multiple viable approaches and trade-offs\r\n- **Algorithm optimization** where multiple strategies should be explored\r\n- **Debugging complex issues** where root cause may not be immediately apparent\r\n- **Tasks needing context maintenance** across multiple analytical steps\r\n- **Situations with irrelevant noise** requiring careful filtering of information\r\n\r\nDo NOT use for simple, straightforward tasks with obvious solutions.\r\n\r\n## How to Use This Framework\r\n\r\n### Core Thinking Process\r\n\r\nStructure analysis as a sequence of numbered thoughts, each building toward the solution. Follow these principles:\r\n\r\n1. **Start with an Initial Estimate**\r\n   - Begin by estimating total thoughts needed (e.g., \"I estimate this will take 5 thoughts\")\r\n   - Understand this is flexible and can be adjusted\r\n\r\n2. **Progress Through Thoughts Sequentially**\r\n   - Number each thought (1, 2, 3, ...)\r\n   - Focus each thought on a specific aspect of the problem\r\n   - Build on previous insights while remaining open to revision\r\n\r\n3. **Types of Thoughts**\r\n\r\n   **Regular Analytical Thoughts:**\r\n   - Standard problem-solving steps\r\n   - Information gathering and analysis\r\n   - Logical deduction and inference\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 3/7: Analyzing the time complexity of the current approach...\"\r\n\r\n   **Revision Thoughts:**\r\n   - Question or reconsider previous conclusions\r\n   - Mark with: \"Thought 5/7 (Revising Thought 2): Upon further reflection...\"\r\n   - Update understanding based on new insights\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 6/8 (Revising Thought 3): Actually, the earlier assumption about constant-time lookup was incorrect because...\"\r\n\r\n   **Branching Thoughts:**\r\n   - Explore alternative approaches\r\n   - Mark with: \"Thought 4/7 (Branch A from Thought 2): Exploring alternative approach...\"\r\n   - Can have multiple branches: Branch A, Branch B, etc.\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 5/9 (Branch A from Thought 3): If we use a hash map instead...\"\r\n\r\n   **Realizations About Scope:**\r\n   - Recognize when more/fewer thoughts are needed\r\n   - Adjust total count: \"Thought 5/7: This is more complex than initially estimated. Adjusting to 10 thoughts.\"\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 3/5: This problem is simpler than expected. Adjusting to 4 thoughts total.\"\r\n\r\n   **Hypothesis Generation:**\r\n   - Propose potential solutions\r\n   - State clearly: \"Hypothesis: [solution approach]\"\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 7/10: Hypothesis: Using a trie data structure will reduce lookup time from O(n) to O(k) where k is key length.\"\r\n\r\n   **Hypothesis Verification:**\r\n   - Test proposed solutions against requirements\r\n   - Identify flaws or confirm validity\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 8/10: Verifying hypothesis - checking edge cases... Found issue: doesn't handle Unicode properly.\"\r\n\r\n4. **Iteration and Refinement**\r\n   - If hypothesis fails verification, generate new hypothesis\r\n   - Continue until a satisfactory solution emerges\r\n   - Don't force premature conclusion\r\n\r\n5. **Filtering Irrelevant Information**\r\n   - At each thought, focus only on relevant aspects\r\n   - Explicitly ignore tangential details\r\n   - Example: \"Thought 4/8: Focusing on the caching layer; ignoring UI concerns for now.\"\r\n\r\n6. **Final Thought**\r\n   - Clearly mark when complete: \"Thought 10/10 (Final)\"\r\n   - Provide the definitive answer or solution\r\n   - Summarize key insights if helpful\r\n\r\n### Formatting Thoughts\r\n\r\nPresent thoughts in a clear, structured format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThought [current]/[total]: [Content]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor special thought types:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThought [current]/[total] (Revising Thought [number]): [Content]\r\nThought [current]/[total] (Branch [ID] from Thought [number]): [Content]\r\nThought [current]/[total] (Final): [Content]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Adjustment Examples\r\n\r\n**Increasing Scope:**\r\n```\r\nThought 1/5: Analyzing the problem requirements...\r\nThought 2/5: Breaking down into components...\r\nThought 3/5: Wait, there's additional complexity here with concurrency. Adjusting to 8 thoughts.\r\nThought 4/8: Now examining thread-safety considerations...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Decreasing Scope:**\r\n```\r\nThought 1/7: Examining all possible approaches...\r\nThought 2/7: Actually, the built-in library handles this. Adjusting to 3 thoughts.\r\nThought 3/3 (Final): Use the standard library's XYZ method.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Branching and Comparing:**\r\n```\r\nThought 3/8: Two viable approaches identified. Exploring both.\r\nThought 4/8 (Branch A): Using approach A with recursion...\r\nThought 5/8 (Branch B): Using approach B with iteration...\r\nThought 6/8: Comparing branches - Branch B is more efficient due to...\r\nThought 7/8: Selecting Branch B approach.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Revision Based on New Insight:**\r\n```\r\nThought 4/7: Based on assumption X, the solution is Y...\r\nThought 5/7 (Revising Thought 4): Assumption X is actually false because Z. Need different approach.\r\nThought 6/7: New solution considering Z...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Process Termination\r\n\r\nOnly conclude when:\r\n- A satisfactory solution has been found AND verified\r\n- All critical aspects have been considered\r\n- Confidence in the answer is high\r\n\r\nDo NOT conclude prematurely to meet an estimated thought count. Add more thoughts if needed.\r\n\r\n### Example: Complete Thought Sequence\r\n\r\n```\r\nThought 1/5: Analyzing the problem - need to find the fastest way to detect duplicates in a stream of integers.\r\n\r\nThought 2/5: Initial approach - use a HashSet for O(1) lookup. Space complexity O(n).\r\n\r\nThought 3/5: Considering constraints - stream is potentially infinite, can't store everything. Adjusting to 7 thoughts.\r\n\r\nThought 4/7 (Branch A from Thought 2): Exploring Bloom filter approach - probabilistic but constant space.\r\n\r\nThought 5/7 (Branch B from Thought 2): Exploring sliding window approach - only track recent N items.\r\n\r\nThought 6/7: Comparing approaches. If false positives acceptable, Bloom filter is optimal. Otherwise, sliding window with configurable size.\r\n\r\nThought 7/7 (Final): Recommendation depends on requirements:\r\n- If no false positives allowed: Sliding window with HashSet (O(1) lookup, O(N) space for window size N)\r\n- If rare false positives acceptable: Bloom filter (O(1) lookup, constant space)\r\n- Recommend option 1 for correctness unless memory is severely constrained.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Be Honest About Uncertainty** - Express when multiple paths exist or understanding is incomplete\r\n2. **Don't Force Linear Progression** - Branch, backtrack, or revise as needed\r\n3. **Adjust Dynamically** - Change estimated thought count based on evolving understanding\r\n4. **Focus Each Thought** - One clear purpose per thought\r\n5. **Verify Before Concluding** - Test hypotheses against requirements and edge cases\r\n6. **Filter Noise** - Ignore irrelevant details at each step\r\n7. **Maintain Context** - Reference previous thoughts when building on them\r\n8. **Embrace Iteration** - Failed hypotheses lead to better solutions\r\n\r\n## Output Format\r\n\r\nAfter completing the thought sequence, provide:\r\n\r\n1. **The Final Answer** - Clear, actionable solution or recommendation\r\n2. **Key Insights** (optional) - Summary of important discoveries from the thinking process\r\n3. **Next Steps** (if applicable) - What should be done to implement or verify the solution\r\n\r\nPresent this as normal output after the thought sequence, not as another numbered thought."
