Each agent explores the problem from a different perspective.\n\n## How to Brainstorm\n\n1. Extract the high-level problem from the user's request, using their words as much as possible\n2. Launch all 3 agents in parallel (single message with 3 Task tool calls):\n   - Use `subagent_type: \"general-purpose\"`\n   - Use `model: \"haiku\"` for cost-effectiveness (exploratory work)\n3. Wait for all results\n4. Synthesize findings and present to user\n\n## The Three Perspectives\n\n### Agent 1: Pain Points Analyst\n\n**Personality:** Thinks about pain points, bounds, what scenarios to avoid, and only then thinks how to address those.\n\n**Prompt template:**\n\n```\nProblem: [user's problem in their words]\n\nAnalyze from a defensive perspective. List:\n1. Pain points and constraints\n2. Bounds (technical, time, resources)\n3. Scenarios that must be avoided\n\nThen suggest approaches that address these concerns.\n```\n\n### Agent 2: Minimal Code Advocate\n\n**Personality:** Tries finding solutions that use as little code as possible.\n\n**Prompt template:**\n\n```\nProblem: [user's problem in their words]\n\nFind the simplest solution. Consider:\n1. The absolute minimum code needed\n2. Existing tools/libraries that could handle this\n3. What can be deleted or avoided entirely\n\nPropose the leanest viable approach.\n```\n\n### Agent 3: Battle-Seasoned CTO\n\n**Personality:** A battle-seasoned CTO who knows how things go wrong.\n\n**Prompt template:**\n\n```\nProblem: [user's problem in their words]\n\nReview with experience-earned skepticism. Identify:\n1. Where this will break in production\n2. Edge cases that will bite us later\n3. What looks simple but isn't\n\nState what you'd insist on if this was your company.\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\nUser: \"Let's brainstorm how to add caching to the API\"\n\nLaunch 3 Task agents in parallel:\n- Pain Points Analyst: Explores cache invalidation challenges, memory bounds, consistency scenarios to avoid\n- Minimal Code Advocate: Considers if a simple in-memory cache or existing library suffices\n- Battle-Seasoned CTO: Warns about cache stampedes, cold start issues, debugging complexity\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter collecting all 3 perspectives, present a synthesis:\n\n1. **Summary of perspectives** - Brief overview of each agent's key insights\n2. **Common themes** - What multiple agents agreed on\n3. **Key tensions** - Where perspectives differed\n4. **Recommended next steps** - Concrete options for the user to choose from"

Each entry has the format:\n```\n\"plugin-name@marketplace-name\": true/false\n```\n\nOnly consider plugins where the value is `true` (enabled). If the file doesn't exist or `enabledPlugins` is missing, inform the user no plugins are installed.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Plugin Folders\n\nPlugin source code is cached at:\n```\n~/.claude/plugins/cache/{marketplace-name}/{plugin-name}/\n```\n\nFor example, `hookify@claude-plugins-official` would be at:\n```\n~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/hookify/\n```\n\n**Note:** Local/dev plugins may have different paths (e.g., a local directory the user is developing in). If a plugin isn't found in the cache, ask the user for its path.\n\n### Step 3: Launch Parallel Security Scans\n\nFor each plugin to scan (or a subset if user specified), launch a subagent using the Task tool:\n\n- Use `subagent_type: \"general-purpose\"`\n- Run all agents in parallel (single message with multiple Task tool calls)\n- Use `run_in_background: true` so scans run asynchronously\n\n**Prompt template for each subagent:**\n\n```\nSecurity review the Claude Code plugin at: {plugin_path}\n\nPrioritize scanning executable code files (.js, .ts, .sh, .py, hooks/, commands/, agents/) over docs and assets.\n\nLook for:\n\n1. **Command injection risks** - Shell commands built from user input, unsafe exec/spawn calls\n2. **Data exfiltration** - Suspicious network calls, sending data to external servers\n3. **File system abuse** - Reading/writing sensitive paths (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, credentials files)\n4. **Privilege escalation** - Attempts to modify system files or gain elevated access\n5. **Obfuscated code** - Base64 encoded strings, eval(), minified code hiding malicious intent\n6. **Hook abuse** - Hooks that silently modify behavior or intercept sensitive data\n7. **Dependency risks** - Suspicious npm/pip packages, pinned to specific vulnerable versions\n8. **Sandbox bypass** - Use of `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in hook scripts or commands\n\nFor each finding, report:\n- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low\n- File and line number\n- Description of the risk\n- Code snippet if relevant\n\nIf no issues found, state that the plugin appears safe.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Collect and Present Results\n\nAfter all subagents complete, summarize:\n1. Plugins scanned\n2. Critical/High severity findings (if any)\n3. Medium/Low findings grouped by plugin\n4. Overall assessment\n5. **Recommended actions** for any issues found:\n   - Critical: Disable plugin immediately (`enabledPlugins` → `false`), report to marketplace maintainer\n   - High: Review the specific code, consider disabling until fixed\n   - Medium/Low: Note for awareness, optionally report upstream\n\n## Example Usage\n\n**User:** \"Review my installed plugins for security issues\"\n\n**Action:**\n1. Read ~/.claude/settings.json to find enabled plugins\n2. For each enabled plugin, launch a background security scan subagent\n3. Inform user that scans are running\n4. When results come back, present consolidated security report\n\n**User:** \"Scan only the hookify plugin\"\n\n**Action:**\n1. Launch single subagent to scan ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/hookify/\n2. Present results when complete\n\n## Proactive Suggestion\n\nWhen you see a user install a new plugin (e.g., via `/plugins install` command output), say:\n\n> \"I notice you've added a new plugin. Would you like me to run a security review on it? You can use `/plugins-security-review` to scan installed plugins.\""
