If not merged, warn user.\n\n### Step 3: Delete Worktree (If Present)\n\nCheck if a worktree exists for this issue and delete it:\n\n```bash\n# Extract issue number from branch name\nISSUE_NUM=$(git branch --show-current | grep -oP 'issue-\\K[0-9]+')\n\n# Try to delete worktree using the global CLI\n# This will fail gracefully if no worktree exists\nnpx @builtby.win/worktree delete ${ISSUE_NUM} 2>/dev/null && WORKTREE_DELETED=1\n```\n\nAlternatively with globally installed CLI:\n```bash\nworktree delete ${ISSUE_NUM} 2>/dev/null && WORKTREE_DELETED=1\n```\n\nIf worktree was deleted, it will:\n- Stop the dev server if running\n- Remove `.worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug}/` directory\n- Free up the assigned port\n- Update `.worktree-metadata.json`\n\n### Step 4: Switch to Main\n\n```bash\ngit checkout main\ngit pull origin main\n```\n\n### Step 5: Delete Local Branch\n\n```bash\ngit branch -d {PROJECT_PREFIX}/issue-{N}-{slug}\n```\n\nUse `-D` (force) if needed, but prefer `-d` to catch unmerged commits.\n\n### Step 6: Delete Remote Branch\n\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete {PROJECT_PREFIX}/issue-{N}-{slug}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Verify Issue Closed\n\n```bash\ngh issue view {N} --json state\n```\n\nThe issue should be closed automatically by the `Closes #N` in the PR body.\n\n### Step 8: Announce\n\nOutput:\n```\nPR #{PR_NUM} merged!\n\nCleanup complete:\n- Switched to main\n- Deleted local branch: {PROJECT_PREFIX}/issue-{N}-{slug}\n- Deleted remote branch\n- Issue #{N} is now closed\n\nReady for next task. Run /work to see what's available.\n```\n\nIf worktree was deleted, also include:\n```\n- Deleted worktree: .worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug}\n  - Stopped dev server (port {PORT} now available)\n  - Removed {N} database snapshot(s)\n```\n\n## Auto-Detection\n\nClaude should detect when a PR is merged by:\n1. User mentions PR was merged\n2. Checking PR state: `gh pr view --json state`\n3. Detecting we're on a stale issue branch\n\nWhen detected, automatically run cleanup.\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **PR not merged yet**: \"PR #{PR_NUM} is still open. Merge it first, then run /done\"\n- **Already on main**: \"Already on main. No cleanup needed.\"\n- **Branch already deleted**: \"Branch already cleaned up.\"\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn your project's `CLAUDE.md`, set:\n\n```markdown\n## GitHub Workflow Configuration\nPROJECT_PREFIX=your-project-name\n```\n\nExample configurations:\n- `PROJECT_PREFIX=areyougo.ing` (for areyougo.ing project)\n- `PROJECT_PREFIX=builtby-win-web` (for builtby.win/web)\n- `PROJECT_PREFIX=myapp` (for any custom project)"

Running `/setup-worktree` in each project\n2. Installing `tsx` as a dev dependency\n3. Copying a script file to `scripts/`\n4. Adding a package.json script entry\n\nThe new approach:\n1. Just works with `npx @builtby.win/worktree`\n2. No project-specific setup\n3. Works across all your projects\n4. Stays up-to-date automatically\n\n## Features (Unchanged)\n\n- **Isolated Development**: Create separate worktrees for each issue/feature\n- **Database Snapshots**: Automatically snapshot SQLite databases\n- **Port Management**: Auto-assign ports to avoid conflicts\n- **Dev Server Control**: Optionally start dev servers automatically\n- **Package Manager Agnostic**: Works with npm, yarn, or pnpm\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Worktree Plugin README](../../README.md)\n- npm package: `@builtby.win/worktree`"

(y/n)\n```\n\nIf yes, commit to the blog repo:\n```bash\ncd {BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}\ngit add {slug}.md\ngit commit -m \"draft: {title}\"\n```\n\n## Frontmatter Schema\n\nRequired fields:\n- `title` (string) - Post title\n- `date` (date) - YYYY-MM-DD format\n- `draft` (boolean) - Always `true` for new notes\n\nOptional fields:\n- `description` (string) - Brief summary\n- `tags` (string[]) - Array of tags\n\n## Example\n\nUser is working on import-magic and says `/note`:\n\n```\n> What did you learn?\n\"How to handle ESM vs CommonJS imports dynamically\"\n\n> Brief description?\n\"A technique for detecting and handling both module systems\"\n\n> Any code to include?\n[user pastes code]\n\n> Tags? (suggesting: import-magic, javascript)\n\"javascript, esm, commonjs\"\n```\n\nCreates `{BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}/esm-commonjs-dynamic-imports.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"How to handle ESM vs CommonJS imports dynamically\"\ndate: 2025-12-31\ndescription: \"A technique for detecting and handling both module systems\"\ntags: [\"import-magic\", \"javascript\", \"esm\", \"commonjs\"]\ndraft: true\n---\n\n[Content here...]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Always set `draft: true` - use `/blog` from portfolio to publish\n- Include the source project as a tag for easy filtering\n- Keep the initial draft concise - can flesh out later with `/blog`"

Read the current file\n2. Change `draft: true` to `draft: false`\n3. Optionally update the date to today\n4. Write the updated file\n5. Commit and optionally push:\n\n```bash\ncd {BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}\ngit add {filename}\ngit commit -m \"post: {title}\"\ngit push\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nPublished: {title}\nLocation: {BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}/{filename}\n\nCommitted and pushed to main.\n```\n\n#### Unpublish (for published posts)\n1. Read the current file\n2. Add or change to `draft: true`\n3. Write the updated file\n4. Commit:\n\n```bash\ncd {BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}\ngit add {filename}\ngit commit -m \"unpublish: {title}\"\n```\n\n#### View\nShow the full post content in a readable format.\n\n#### Delete\n- Confirm with user: \"Are you sure you want to delete '{title}'?\"\n- If confirmed:\n\n```bash\ncd {BLOG_CONTENT_DIR}\nrm {filename}\ngit add -A .\ngit commit -m \"remove: {title}\"\n```\n\n### Step 7: Continue or Exit\n\nAfter each action, ask:\n```\nWould you like to work on another post?

                "content": "# Setup Worktree (Deprecated)\n\n> **This skill is deprecated.** The worktree CLI is now available as an npm package.\n> No project-specific setup is required anymore!\n\n## Use the npm CLI Instead\n\n```bash\n# Use directly with npx (no install needed)\nnpx @builtby.win/worktree create 15 dark-mode --start-server\nnpx @builtby.win/worktree list\nnpx @builtby.win/worktree delete 15\n\n# Or install globally for faster access\nnpm install -g @builtby.win/worktree\nworktree create 15 dark-mode --start-server\n```\n\n## Migration\n\nIf you previously ran `/setup-worktree` in a project, you can optionally clean up:\n\n```bash\n# Remove local script (optional)\nrm scripts/manage-worktree.ts\n\n# The npx CLI is fully compatible with existing .worktree-metadata.json files\n```\n\n## Why the Change?\n\nThe old approach required:\n1. Running `/setup-worktree` in each project\n2. Installing `tsx` as a dev dependency\n3. Copying a script file to `scripts/`\n4. Adding a package.json script entry\n\nThe new approach:\n1. Just works with `npx @builtby.win/worktree`\n2. No project-specific setup\n3. Works across all your projects\n4. Stays up-to-date automatically\n\n## Features (Unchanged)\n\n- **Isolated Development**: Create separate worktrees for each issue/feature\n- **Database Snapshots**: Automatically snapshot SQLite databases\n- **Port Management**: Auto-assign ports to avoid conflicts\n- **Dev Server Control**: Optionally start dev servers automatically\n- **Package Manager Agnostic**: Works with npm, yarn, or pnpm\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Worktree Plugin README](../../README.md)\n- npm package: `@builtby.win/worktree`"
