Create Pull request in GitHub using the `gh` CLI.\nThis command is called by an orchestrating command, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.\nYou MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n1. List unstaged changes using `git status`\n\n2. Read the specification linked in the state management file ($2) and compare with unstaged changes to understand how the increment has been implemented and which unstaged changes are relevant to the increment. Ignore the specifications and state_management folders.\n\n3. Create a git commit using the guidelines in @docs/git-commit.md\n\n4. Push the commit using `git push`\n\n5. Read the Settings section in the state management file ($2)\n\n6. **Check Silent Mode for Pull Request Creation**:\n   - If `silentMode` is `false`:\n     - Create a pull request using `gh pr create --title \"feat: $1 [brief description from commit]\" --base [default branch name] --head $(git branch --show-current)`\n   - If `silentMode` is `true`:\n     - Log: \"Silent mode: Would have created PR with title 'feat: [issue key] [brief description]'\"\n     - Skip the actual PR creation\n\n7. **Check Silent Mode for Issue Status Update**:\n   - If `silentMode` is `false` AND `issueTrackingProvider` is NOT `\"prompt\"`:\n     - Use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/update-issue $1 \"Code Review\" $2`\n   - If `silentMode` is `true` OR `issueTrackingProvider` is `\"prompt\"`:\n     - Log: \"Silent mode: Would have updated issue $1 status to 'Code Review'\"\n     - Skip the issue update\n"

Each workflow run should implement the smallest possible increment that provides measurable value while maintaining the system's quality standards.\n\nYou are responsible for making sure all steps are done according to the workflow steps description below.\n\nIMPORTANT: All steps MUST complete, and they must be completed in the order described below.\nYou are only allowed to move to the next step after the previous step has completed.\n\nThe issue key or prompt for the feature to implement is $1.\n\nCreate a TODO list for the workflow steps, and follow it.\n\n## Arguments\n\n- `$1`: Issue key or feature prompt (required)\n- `$2+`: Optional settings in format `--provider=<value>` or `--silent=<value>`\n  - `--provider`: Override issue tracking provider (`linear`, `jira`, or `prompt`)\n  - `--silent`: Override silent mode (`true` or `false`)\n\n## Pre-Processing\n\nBefore starting the workflow for user prompts, create an issue key based on $1:\n\n- List the contents of `state_management` in the additional directories\n- If there are no filenames using the format `prompt-{number}`, use issue key `prompt-1-{short-description}`\n- If there is at least one filename using the format `prompt-{number}`, use issue key `prompt-{number+1}-{short-description}`\n- The short description should be a kebab-case summary of the prompt (e.g., `prompt-1-implement-cli`, `prompt-2-add-auth`)\n\nParse optional settings arguments ($2, $3, etc.) to extract provider and silent overrides for passing to `/read-settings`.\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n1. Read @CLAUDE.md: General principles, quality gates, and development workflow. If the @CLAUDE.md refers to other @CLAUDE.md files, read those as well.\n2. Create a state management file for this increment - use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/create-state-management-file $1` if the workflow was started from an issue, or the issue key if it was started from a prompt\n3. Read settings - use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/read-settings [state-management-file-path]` with any optional settings arguments from $2+ (e.g., `/read-settings [path] --provider=prompt --silent=true`)\n4. Read issue - check the issueTrackingProvider in the Settings section of the state management file. If not \"prompt\", use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/read-issue [issue-key] [state-management-file-path]`. If \"prompt\", skip this step as there is no external issue to read.\n5. Define requirements - Use the requirements-definer subagent to define requirements for [state-management-file-path]\n6. Audit requirements - Use the requirements-definer-auditor subagent to audit requirements in [state-management-file-path]. If audit fails with critical issues, return to step 5 to address them.\n7. Get sign-off on requirements. You are not allowed to go to step 8 until the user has signed off on the requirements. Use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/requirements-sign-off [state-management-file-path]`\n8. Write specification - Use the specification-writer subagent to write specification for [state-management-file-path]\n9. Audit specification - Use the specification-writer-auditor subagent to audit specification in [state-management-file-path]. If audit fails with critical issues, return to step 8 to address them.\n10. Get sign-off on specification. You are not allowed to go to step 11 until the user has signed off on the specification. Use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/specification-sign-off [state-management-file-path]`\n11. Check out new branch - use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/git-checkout [issue-key] [state-management-file-path]`\n12. Implement increment - use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/implement-increment [issue-key] [state-management-file-path]`\n13. Perform security review:\n    - Use the security-reviewer subagent to analyze the implementation at [state-management-file-path]\n    - Parse the verdict from the subagent's output (look for \"**Decision**: APPROVED\" or \"**Decision**: NEEDS_CHANGES\")\n    - If APPROVED: proceed to next step\n    - If NEEDS_CHANGES:\n      a. Inform user that security vulnerabilities were found\n      b. Return to step 12 (implement increment) where agents will read security_reviews/{issue-key}.md to understand what needs to be fixed\n      c. Continue through steps 12-13 until APPROVED\n14. Write end-to-end tests for the increment - use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/write-end-to-end-tests [state-management-file-path]`\n15. Perform code review:\n    - Use the code-reviewer subagent to review the implementation for [state-management-file-path]\n    - Parse the verdict from the agent's output (look for \"**Decision**: APPROVED\" or \"**Decision**: NEEDS_CHANGES\")\n    - If APPROVED:\n      a. Extract issue key from state management file\n      b. Extract code review summary from agent output:\n         - Look for the section starting with \"## Code Review Summary\"\n         - Extract everything from that heading through the end of the output\n         - This section must include Decision, Summary, Completed, and other details\n         - Format contract: The agent outputs this in a specific format (see code-reviewer.md section 9)\n      c. Use SlashCommand tool to execute `/issue:create-comment [issue-key] \"[code review summary]\" [state-management-file-path]`\n      d. Proceed to next step\n    - If NEEDS_CHANGES:\n      a. Inform the user that code review returned NEEDS_CHANGES and implementation will be revised\n      b.

Understand the division of work and implement tasks:\n    - Read specification to identify agent_ids and Dependency Graph from the Implementation Plan\n    - Check for code review feedback:\n      - Determine code-review file path: `code_reviews/{issue-key}.md` (where issue-key is $1)\n      - If file exists: Read the latest review (most recent \"Review #N\" section) to understand what needs fixing\n      - If this is a revision (code-review file exists), prioritize addressing review issues over spec additions\n      - Note: Subagents will automatically check for and read code_reviews/{issue-key}.md if it exists - no need to pass review content explicitly\n    - Create \"Implementation Agents Status\" section in state management file to track progress:\n\n      ```markdown\n      ## Implementation Agents Status\n      - agent-1: pending (revision: 0)\n      - agent-2: pending (revision: 0)\n      ```\n\n    - Process agents in dependency order:\n      a. Identify agents with no dependencies or whose dependencies are complete\n      b. Update their status to \"in_progress\" in Implementation Agents Status\n      c. Spawn those agents in parallel using the increment-implementer subagent via Task tool\n      d. Pass to each subagent: the agent_id and state management file path\n      e. Monitor for completion signals (\"AGENT_COMPLETE: [agent_id]\")\n      f. When an agent reports completion, invoke increment-implementer-auditor subagent via Task tool\n      g. Pass to auditor: the agent_id and state management file path\n      h. Wait for audit result (AUDIT_PASSED/AUDIT_FAILED)\n      i. If audit passes, update status to \"completed\" in Implementation Agents Status\n      j. If audit fails:\n         - Update status to \"needs_revision\" in Implementation Agents Status\n         - Extract specific feedback from audit report\n         - Re-spawn the increment-implementer subagent with the feedback\n         - Pass: agent_id, state management file path, and \"Validator/Auditor feedback: [specific issues]\"\n         - Increment revision counter for tracking\n         - Repeat audit cycle until pass or max revisions reached (3 attempts)\n         - If max revisions reached, mark as \"failed\" and handle as agent failure\n      k. Repeat until all agents are complete\n    - Handle agent failures:\n      - If an agent reports failure, mark it as \"failed\" in Implementation Agents Status\n      - Do not spawn agents that depend on failed agents\n      - Report the failure chain to the user\n    - When all agent_ids are complete, implementation is finished\n\n## This part of the workflow is done when\n\n- [ ] All subagents are complete and have passed their audits\n- [ ] All audit feedback has been addressed through the revision process\n- [ ] Single behavior is fully implemented, both on the backend and the frontend\n- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass\n- [ ] All quality gates pass (see @CLAUDE.md for commands)\n- [ ] No breaking changes introduced\n- [ ] No test failures introduced in areas of the code unrelated to this increment\n- [ ] Feature works in both development and build modes\n- [ ] Business rules are enforced consistently\n- [ ] Implementation strictly adheres to specification without scope creep\n- [ ] No unnecessary code or over-engineering detected in audits\n"
