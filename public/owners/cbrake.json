Read @CLAUDE.md to find the list of manifest files under the \"Release\n   Management\" section. These files contain version numbers that need to be\n   updated.\n\n2. Read the CHANGELOG.md file to find:\n   - The latest version number (look for `## [X.Y.Z]` format)\n   - Any `## [Unreleased]` section that needs to be converted\n\n3. Determine the release version:\n   - If \"$ARGUMENTS\" are provided, use that as the version number (e.g.,\n     `/release 2.0.0`)\n   - If an `## [Unreleased]` section exists, calculate the next version by\n     incrementing the patch version (e.g., 1.0.6 → 1.0.7)\n   - If no `## [Unreleased]` section exists, use the latest version found in the\n     changelog\n\n4. Update CHANGELOG.md:\n   - Replace `## [Unreleased]` with\n     `## [X.Y.Z] - <current date in YYYY-MM-DD format>`\n   - Keep all content under that section unchanged\n   - Add a `## [Unreleased]` section at the top for new changes.\n\n5. Update version in all manifest files listed in CLAUDE.md:\n   - Search for version fields in each manifest file (patterns like\n     `\"version\":`, `version =`, `version:`, etc.)\n   - Update the version value to match the release version\n   - Preserve all other fields and formatting\n\n6. Create a git tag for the version:\n   - Format: `v<version>` (e.g., `v1.0.7`)\n   - Use `git tag v<version>` to create the tag\n\n7. Provide a summary showing:\n   - The version that was released\n   - The date applied to the changelog\n   - Which manifest files were updated\n   - The git tag created\n   - Remind the user to commit the changes and push with `git push --tags`\n\nImportant: Do not push tags or commit changes automatically. Let the user review\nand push when ready.\n"
