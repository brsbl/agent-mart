                "content": "# Component Registry Query Skill\n\nThis skill helps query the ACM/MCE component registry (component-registry.yaml) to find information about components, squads, repositories, and their relationships.\n\n## What this skill does\n\n- Find which squad owns a specific component\n- List all components owned by a squad\n- Get GitHub repository URL for a component\n- Find Konflux component names\n- Get JIRA component mappings\n- Find bundle information\n- Get prodsec component identifiers\n- Search components by various attributes\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Load the component registry\n\nFirst, read the component-registry.yaml file. The file is located at `product/component-registry.yaml` relative to the project root:\n\n```bash\ncat product/component-registry.yaml\n```\n\nOr use the Read tool to read the file directly.\n\n### Step 2: Parse and query the data\n\nThe YAML structure contains a list of components with these fields:\n- `name`: Component name\n- `konflux_component`: Konflux component identifier\n- `bundle`: Bundle name (e.g., \"mce-operator-bundle\", \"acm-operator-bundle\")\n- `repository`: GitHub repository URL\n- `prodseccomponent`: Product security component identifier\n- `squad`: Squad/team name\n- `jira_component`: JIRA component name\n\n### Step 3: Answer the query\n\nProcess the YAML data to answer questions like:\n\n**Squad ownership queries:**\n- \"Which squad owns [component]?\" → Find component and return squad field\n- \"What components does [squad] own?\" → Filter by squad field and list all components\n\n**Repository queries:**\n- \"What's the GitHub repo for [component]?\" → Return repository field\n- \"Show me the repo URL for [component]\" → Return repository field\n\n**Component mapping queries:**\n- \"What's the Konflux component for [component]?\" → Return konflux_component field\n- \"What JIRA component for [component]?\" → Return jira_component field\n- \"What bundle is [component] in?\" → Return bundle field\n\n**List queries:**\n- \"List all Server Foundation components\" → Filter by squad: \"Server Foundation\"\n- \"Show all components in mce-operator-bundle\" → Filter by bundle\n- \"What components are in the GRC squad?\" → Filter by squad: \"GRC\"\n\n### Step 4: Format the response\n\nPresent the information clearly:\n- For single component queries: Show all relevant fields\n- For list queries: Use bullet points or tables\n- Include links to GitHub repositories when showing repo information\n- Highlight the specific information requested\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Find squad ownership\n\n**User asks:** \"Which squad is responsible for cluster-proxy?\"\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read component-registry.yaml\n2. Search for component with name: \"cluster-proxy\"\n3. Extract the squad field\n\n**Response:**\n```\nThe cluster-proxy component is owned by the Server Foundation squad.\n\nAdditional details:\n- Konflux component: cluster-proxy-mce\n- Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-proxy\n- Bundle: mce-operator-bundle\n- JIRA component: Server Foundation\n```\n\n### Example 2: Find repository URL\n\n**User asks:** \"What's the GitHub repo for thanos?\"\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read component-registry.yaml\n2. Find component with name: \"thanos\"\n3. Return repository URL\n\n**Response:**\n```\nThe GitHub repository for thanos is: https://github.com/stolostron/thanos\n\nThis component is:\n- Owned by: Observability squad\n- Part of: acm-operator-bundle\n- Konflux component: thanos-acm\n```\n\n### Example 3: List squad components\n\n**User asks:** \"What components does the Hypershift squad own?\"\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read component-registry.yaml\n2. Filter all components where squad == \"Hypershift\"\n3. List component names\n\n**Response:**\n```\nThe Hypershift squad owns the following components:\n\n- cluster-api-provider-agent\n- cluster-api-provider-kubevirt\n- hypershift-addon-operator\n- hypershift-cli\n- hypershift-release\n```\n\n### Example 4: Multiple attribute query\n\n**User asks:** \"Show me all components in the Install squad with their repos\"\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read component-registry.yaml\n2. Filter by squad: \"Install\"\n3. Extract name and repository for each\n\n**Response:**\n```\nInstall squad components:\n\n1. backplane-must-gather\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/backplane-must-gather\n\n2. backplane-operator\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/backplane-operator\n\n3. discovery-operator\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/discovery\n\n4. mce-operator-bundle\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/mce-operator-bundle\n\n5. acm-operator-bundle\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/acm-operator-bundle\n\n6. multiclusterhub-operator\n   Repository: https://github.com/stolostron/multiclusterhub-operator\n```\n\n## Tips for effective queries\n\n1. **Use exact component names** when possible (case-sensitive matching preferred)\n2. **Common squad names** include: Server Foundation, Install, Hypershift, CAPI, Assisted Installer, Cluster Lifecycle, Console, Hive, GRC, Observability, Search, etc.\n3. **Repository URLs** are GitHub links - can be opened directly\n4. **Some components may not have all fields** - handle missing data gracefully\n5. **JIRA components** may differ from squad names (e.g., \"Infrastructure Operator\" vs \"Assisted Installer\")\n\n## Error handling\n\n- If component not found: Suggest similar component names or ask user to verify spelling\n- If squad not found: List all available squads\n- For missing fields: Indicate field is not available for that component\n- For ambiguous queries: Ask for clarification\n\n## Notes\n\n- The component-registry.yaml file is located at: `product/component-registry.yaml` (relative to project root)\n- Data is sourced from product-manifest.json and component-squad.yaml\n- Last updated information is in the header comments of the YAML file\n- Some components may have duplicate entries with different Konflux component names"
