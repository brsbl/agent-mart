This is critical - include specific capabilities and trigger terms users would mention.\n3. **Markdown instructions** after the frontmatter that describe how to apply the skill\n\n**Example SKILL.md structure:**\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: agentic-jumpstart-security\ndescription: Security best practices and guidelines specific to your tech stack. Use when writing secure code, reviewing security concerns, or when the user mentions security, vulnerabilities, or authentication.\n---\n\n# Security Best Practices\n\n[Markdown instructions on how to apply security practices...]\n```\n\nGenerated skills follow this directory structure (all prefixed with \"agentic-jumpstart-\"):\n\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-security/` → `SKILL.md` - Security guidelines specific to your stack\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-performance/` → `SKILL.md` - Performance patterns and optimizations\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-react/` → `SKILL.md` - React-specific patterns (if React detected)\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-backend/` → `SKILL.md` - Backend framework patterns (if backend detected)\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-frontend/` → `SKILL.md` - Frontend framework patterns (if frontend detected)\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-database/` → `SKILL.md` - Database and ORM patterns (if database detected)\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-testing/` → `SKILL.md` - Testing strategies and patterns\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-architecture/` → `SKILL.md` - Codebase structure and organization patterns\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-dependency-management/` → `SKILL.md` - Dependency management best practices\n- `.claude/skills/agentic-jumpstart-code-quality/` → `SKILL.md` - Linting, formatting, and quality standards\n\n## Execution Flow\n\n1. **Initialize**: Create `.claude/skills/` directory if it doesn't exist\n2. **Detect Stack**: Run tech-stack-detector agent and capture results\n3. **Activate Agents**: Based on detection results, activate relevant agents:\n   - Always: security, performance, architecture, dependency, code-quality\n   - Conditionally: react (if React), backend (if backend), frontend (if frontend), database (if database), testing (if testing frameworks)\n4. **Generate Skills**: Each agent creates a subdirectory in `.claude/skills/` prefixed with \"agentic-jumpstart-\" and generates a `SKILL.md` file (case-sensitive, uppercase) inside it. The `SKILL.md` file must include:\n   - YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) starting on line 1 with no blank lines before it\n   - Required `name` field matching the subdirectory name\n   - Required `description` field with specific capabilities and trigger terms that users would naturally say\n   - Markdown instructions after the frontmatter with stack-specific guidance on how to apply the skill\n5. **Summary**: Provide a summary of generated skills and how to use them\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `/analyze-and-generate-skills` in your workspace. The command will:\n\n- Scan your codebase comprehensively\n- Detect your complete tech stack\n- Generate 5-10 specialized skills based on what's detected\n- Create subdirectories in `.claude/skills/` prefixed with \"agentic-jumpstart-\" for each skill\n- Generate a `SKILL.md` file (case-sensitive, uppercase) in each subdirectory with:\n  - YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description` fields\n  - A clear `description` that includes specific capabilities and trigger terms\n  - Markdown instructions describing how to apply that skill\n- Save all skills for automatic future reference\n\n## Output\n\nThe command will create skill directories and files following this structure:\n\n**Skill Directory Structure:**\n\n```\n.claude/skills/\n├── agentic-jumpstart-security/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Always generated\n├── agentic-jumpstart-performance/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Always generated\n├── agentic-jumpstart-react/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Generated if React detected\n├── agentic-jumpstart-backend/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Generated if backend framework detected\n├── agentic-jumpstart-frontend/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Generated if frontend framework detected\n├── agentic-jumpstart-database/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Generated if database detected\n├── agentic-jumpstart-testing/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Generated if testing frameworks detected\n├── agentic-jumpstart-architecture/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Always generated\n├── agentic-jumpstart-dependency-management/\n│   └── SKILL.md          # Always generated\n└── agentic-jumpstart-code-quality/\n    └── SKILL.md          # Always generated\n```\n\nEach `SKILL.md` file follows the official Skill format:\n\n**Required Structure:**\n\n1. **YAML Frontmatter** (between `---` markers):\n\n   - Must start on line 1 with no blank lines before it\n   - Must include `name` field (matching the subdirectory name)\n   - Must include `description` field (critical - Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill)\n   - The `description` should answer: \"What does this Skill do?\" and \"When should Claude use it?\" with specific trigger terms\n\n2. **Markdown Instructions** (after the frontmatter):\n   - Best practices specific to your tech stack\n   - Code patterns and conventions\n   - Implementation guidelines\n   - Examples relevant to your codebase\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- The filename must be exactly `SKILL.md` (uppercase, case-sensitive)\n- The `description` field is crucial - Claude reads descriptions to find relevant Skills, so include keywords users would naturally say\n- Skills are model-invoked: Claude automatically applies relevant Skills when your request matches their description\n- These skills will be automatically referenced in future code generation prompts to ensure the highest quality output that matches your codebase's patterns, conventions, and best practices\n\n## Agent Coordination\n\nThe command coordinates all agents by:\n\n1. Sharing tech stack detection results with all agents\n2. Ensuring conditional agents only run when relevant technologies are detected\n3. Collecting all generated skill content\n4. Creating subdirectories in `.claude/skills/` prefixed with \"agentic-jumpstart-\" for each skill\n5. Writing `SKILL.md` files (case-sensitive, uppercase) in each subdirectory with:\n   - YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) starting on line 1\n   - Required `name` and `description` fields in the frontmatter\n   - A clear `description` with specific capabilities and trigger terms\n   - Markdown instructions after the frontmatter on how to apply the skill\n6. Providing a comprehensive summary of what was generated\n"
