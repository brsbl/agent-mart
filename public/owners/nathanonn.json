Capture non-trivial learnings about requirements, edge cases, design considerations, implementation details, and coding patterns that emerge during development.\n\n**Target outcome**: Preserve institutional knowledge and track the evolution of the codebase by logging insights to session files in `.claude/insights/`, then selectively transferring valuable learnings to CLAUDE.md.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nActivate automatically when:\n- Working on complex implementations with non-trivial design decisions\n- Discovering edge cases or unexpected behaviors\n- Making architectural or performance trade-offs\n- Implementing security-sensitive features\n- Building features where institutional knowledge matters\n\nDo not activate for:\n- Simple bug fixes or trivial changes\n- Routine refactoring without architectural impact\n- Syntax corrections or typos\n\n## File Structure & Session Management\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\n.claude/\n└── insights/\n    ├── session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md (current session)\n    └── archive/\n        └── session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md (archived sessions)\n```\n\n### Session File Naming\n- **Current session**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`\n- **Format**: Use timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` format\n- **Location**: `.claude/insights/` for active sessions\n- **Archive location**: `.claude/insights/archive/` for completed sessions\n\n### Session Creation\n- Create new session file when first insight is logged in a new Claude Code session\n- One file per Claude Code session\n- Each session file is independent - no cross-session merging\n\n### Session File Format\nEach session file contains insights in markdown format with this structure:\n```markdown\n# Insights Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n### [Category]: [Brief Title]\nFiles: `path/to/file.ts`, `another/file.ts`\nTags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n[Clear, concise description of the insight]\n\n[Optional: Brief code snippet if essential - max 3-5 lines]\n\n---\n\n### [Next insight...]\n```\n\n## Logging Insights Workflow\n\n### When to Log Insights\n\n**Automatic logging triggers** (Claude decides these are insight-worthy):\n- Discovery of non-trivial edge cases\n- New requirements emerging during implementation\n- Design decisions and their rationale\n- Performance considerations or optimizations\n- Security implications discovered\n- Dependency choices and trade-offs\n- Architectural patterns adopted\n- Testing strategies implemented\n- Error handling approaches\n- API design decisions\n- State management patterns\n- Data validation rules\n\n**Explicit user requests**:\n- User says \"log this insight\", \"remember this\", or \"capture this learning\"\n- User asks to note specific discoveries\n- User highlights something for future reference\n\n### What NOT to Log\n- Trivial or obvious details (e.g., \"created a new file\")\n- Standard boilerplate code\n- Common language features\n- Syntax corrections or typos\n- Routine refactoring without architectural impact\n- Self-evident code comments\n\n### Logging Process\n\n**Step 1: Identify the insight**\n- Evaluate whether the discovery/decision meets insight criteria\n- When in doubt, log it (user can filter during review)\n\n**Step 2: Create or open session file**\n- If no session file exists for current session, create `.claude/insights/session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`\n- If session file exists, open it for appending\n\n**Step 3: Format the insight**\nUse this template:\n```markdown\n### [Category]: [Brief Title]\nFiles: `path/to/file.ts`, `another/file.ts`\nTags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n[Clear, concise description of the insight]\n\n[Optional: Brief code snippet if essential - max 3-5 lines]\n```\n\n**Category examples**:\n- Architecture, Edge Cases, Performance, Testing, Security\n- Dependencies, Patterns, API Design, State Management\n- Error Handling, Data Flow, Validation\n\n**Tag guidelines**:\n- Use lowercase with hyphens: `#error-handling`, `#api-design`\n- 2-4 tags per insight\n- Common tags: `#performance`, `#security`, `#edge-cases`, `#patterns`, `#testing`, `#api`, `#architecture`\n\n**Description guidelines**:\n- **Clear and concise**: Get to the point quickly\n- **Explain WHY**: Why is this valuable? What problem does it solve?\n- **Context**: What led to this discovery?\n- **Action taken**: What decision was made?\n- **1-3 paragraphs maximum**\n\n**Code snippet rules** (optional):\n- Only include if essential to understanding\n- Maximum 3-5 lines\n- Add comments to highlight key points\n- Label \"good\" vs \"bad\" when comparing approaches\n- Prefer conceptual explanation over code\n\n**Step 4: Append to session file**\n- Add insight to the end of the session file\n- Separate insights with `---` divider\n\n**Step 5: Notify user**\n- Show brief notification: `📝 Logged insight about [topic]`\n- Keep it one line - don't show full insight content\n- Example: `📝 Logged insight about null handling in API responses`\n\n### Logging Frequency\n- Add insights progressively as discovered\n- Don't wait until end of session\n- Multiple insights per session is expected and encouraged\n\n## Review & Selection Workflow\n\n### Initiating Review\n- **User-initiated only**: User asks \"review insights\", \"show me what we learned\", \"summarize insights\"\n- **No automatic suggestions**: Do not proactively suggest reviewing\n\n### Review Process\n\n**Step 1: Consolidation**\n- Read current session insights file from `.claude/insights/session-*.md`\n- Identify related or redundant insights\n- Consolidate similar insights into cohesive entries\n- Refine wording for clarity\n\n**Step 2: Present insights**\nPresent in this format:\n```\nBased on this session, here are the key insights captured:\n\n**[Category Group]**\n\n1/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\n2/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\n**[Another Category Group]**\n\n3/ Insight: [Brief title]\n   Files: [file paths]\n   Explanation: [Why this matters and what was learned]\n\nWhich insights would you like to add to CLAUDE.md? Reply with numbers (e.g., \"1, 3\" or \"all\").\n```\n\n**Presentation guidelines**:\n- Number each insight (1/, 2/, 3/, etc.)\n- Group by category when helpful\n- Include brief explanation of value for each\n- Keep explanations concise (1-2 sentences)\n\n**Step 3: User selection**\n- User responds with numbers: \"1, 3\" or \"1,2,3\" or \"all\" or \"none\"\n- Parse user's selection\n\n**Step 4: Add to CLAUDE.md**\n- Read existing CLAUDE.md (or create if doesn't exist)\n- Add selected insights under appropriate section\n- Format appropriately for CLAUDE.md context\n- Create new section if needed (e.g., \"## Insights & Learnings\")\n- Confirm what was added to user\n\n**Step 5: Archive session file**\n- After adding insights to CLAUDE.md, move session file to archive\n- Move from `.claude/insights/session-*.md` to `.claude/insights/archive/session-*.md`\n- Create archive directory if it doesn't exist\n- Confirm archiving to user\n\n### No Insights Scenario\nIf user asks to review and no insights were logged:\n- Respond: \"No insights were captured in this session yet.\"\n- Don't create empty session files\n\n### Multiple Review Requests\n- User can request review multiple times per session\n- Show all insights logged so far\n- If some were previously added to CLAUDE.md, indicate which ones\n\n### CLAUDE.md Doesn't Exist\n- If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it when adding insights\n- Use standard structure with appropriate sections\n- Add insights under \"## Insights & Learnings\" section\n\n## Archiving & Cleanup\n\n### Automatic Archiving\n- **Trigger**: After user selects insights and they're added to CLAUDE.md\n- **Action**: Move session file from `.claude/insights/` to `.claude/insights/archive/`\n- **Naming**: Keep original filename (e.g., `session-2025-11-17-143022.md`)\n- **Directory creation**: Create `.claude/insights/archive/` if it doesn't exist\n\n### Manual Deletion Option\nUser can request deletion instead of archiving:\n- **Trigger phrases**: \"delete the insights log\", \"clear insights instead of archiving\", \"remove insights file\"\n- **Confirmation**: Ask for confirmation before deleting\n- **Action**: Delete the session file completely instead of archiving\n\n### Cleanup Commands\n- \"archive current session\" - move to archive\n- \"delete current session\" - delete completely (with confirmation)\n- \"clean up old archives\" - user specifies which archived files to remove\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n### Insight Quality Criteria\n1. **Non-trivial**: Adds genuine value to understanding the codebase\n2. **Actionable**: Contains information useful for future development\n3. **Specific**: Tied to concrete decisions or discoveries, not generic advice\n4. **Contextual**: Explains why this matters for this specific project\n\n### When in Doubt\n- **Better to log**: If uncertain whether something is insight-worthy, log it\n- **User can filter**: During review, user decides what's valuable for CLAUDE.md\n- **Better too many than too few**: Session log is temporary; missing insights are lost\n\n### Writing Style\n- **Concise**: Shorter entries are better\n- **Clear**: Use plain language, avoid jargon unless necessary\n- **Focused**: One insight per entry, don't combine unrelated learnings\n- **Practical**: Focus on practical implications, not theoretical concepts\n\n### Category Selection\n- Choose specific, descriptive categories\n- Create new categories when existing ones don't fit\n- Avoid generic categories like \"General\" or \"Miscellaneous\"\n- Categories should help organize related insights\n\n### Tag Selection\n- Use 2-4 tags per insight\n- Tags should aid searchability and filtering\n- Use consistent tag names (check existing tags in file first)\n- Prefer specific tags over broad ones\n\n## Edge Cases & Special Scenarios\n\n### Session File Already Exists\n- If timestamp collision (unlikely), append a letter: `session-2025-11-17-143022-a.md`\n- Log warning about timestamp collision\n\n### Archive Directory Doesn't Exist\n- Create `.claude/insights/archive/` directory when first archiving\n- Don't error if it doesn't exist\n\n### Empty Session\n- Don't create session file until first insight is logged\n- If no insights logged, no file created\n\n### Long Sessions with Many Insights\n- No limit on insights per session\n- File can grow as large as needed\n- Consolidate during review to prevent overwhelming user\n\n## Example Insight Entry\n\n```markdown\n### Edge Case: Null handling in API responses\nFiles: `api/users.ts`, `types/user.ts`\nTags: #api #edge-cases #error-handling\n2025-11-17 14:30:22\n\nDiscovered that third-party user API can return null for email field even though documentation states it's required. Added validation layer with fallback to 'no-email@placeholder.com' for system processes to prevent downstream crashes.\n\n// Good approach\nconst email = userData.email ?? 'no-email@placeholder.com';\n\n// Avoid - will crash downstream\nconst email = userData.email; // assumes always present\n```"

Plans include an index file with phase summary and dependency graph, plus individual phase files with detailed specifications.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- Requirements document (features, business rules, user roles)\n- UI wireframes/specifications (pages, components, interactions) - optional but recommended\n\n**Outputs:**\n- `index.md` - Overview, phase table, dependency graph, key files\n- `phase-XX-name.md` - Individual phase files with specifications\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Requirements\n\nRead the requirements document and extract:\n- Core features and functionality\n- Business rules and constraints\n- User roles and permissions\n- Data entities and relationships\n- Integration points with external systems\n\n### Step 2: Analyze UI Wireframes\n\nIf UI wireframes are provided, identify:\n- Pages and routes\n- Components and their interactions\n- Data displayed on each page\n- User flows and navigation\n- State management needs\n\n### Step 3: Identify Phases\n\nGroup work into logical phases following this order:\n\n1. **Foundation phases** (always first)\n   - Data models and schema\n   - Core infrastructure (auth, API structure)\n\n2. **Domain logic phases**\n   - Business logic libraries\n   - Calculation and validation functions\n\n3. **API/Backend phases**\n   - API routes for CRUD operations\n   - Integration endpoints\n\n4. **UI/Frontend phases**\n   - Pages and layouts\n   - Interactive components\n\n5. **Integration phases** (always last)\n   - Audit logging\n   - Reporting\n   - Dashboard aggregations\n\n### Step 4: Map Dependencies\n\nFor each phase, determine:\n- Which phases must complete first\n- Which phases can run in parallel\n- The critical path through the phases\n\n### Step 5: Generate Index\n\nCreate `index.md` following [index-template.md](references/index-template.md):\n- Write overview matching project context\n- Build phase summary table\n- Draw ASCII dependency graph\n- List key files by category\n- Summarize critical business rules\n\n### Step 6: Generate Phase Files\n\nFor each phase, create `phase-XX-name.md` following [phase-template.md](references/phase-template.md):\n- Write clear goal (1-2 sentences)\n- Provide background context\n- Use appropriate content sections for phase type\n- Add testing checklist\n- Link dependencies and next phase\n\n## Phase Type Guidelines\n\n### Database/Model Phases\n- List each model with field tables\n- Define enums with value descriptions\n- Document relations and constraints\n- Include migration notes\n\n### API/Backend Phases\n- Specify route paths and HTTP methods\n- Define request/response as TypeScript interfaces\n- List validation rules\n- Note authorization requirements\n\n### UI/Frontend Phases\n- Define page routes and purposes\n- Include ASCII wireframes for complex layouts\n- List components with props and features\n- Describe client-side state and logic\n\n### Integration Phases\n- Document data flows between systems\n- Specify event triggers and handlers\n- Define error handling strategies\n\n## Output Guidelines\n\n1. **Description-only** - No implementation code, only specifications\n2. **TypeScript interfaces** - Use interface syntax for API contracts\n3. **Props and features** - Describe components by their interface\n4. **Testing checklists** - Verification items for each phase\n5. **File paths** - Specify exact paths for files to create/modify\n6. **ASCII wireframes** - Use for complex UI layouts (optional)\n\n## Example Phase Naming\n\nUse consistent naming: `phase-XX-short-name.md`\n\n- `phase-01-data-models.md`\n- `phase-02-auth-integration.md`\n- `phase-03-api-routes.md`\n- `phase-04-user-dashboard.md`\n- `phase-05-reporting.md`\n\n## References\n\n- [Index Template](references/index-template.md) - Structure for implementation plan index\n- [Phase Template](references/phase-template.md) - Structure for individual phase files"
