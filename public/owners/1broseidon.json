Main: Analyze requirements, make architecture decisions\n2. Research: Use Context7 for library docs, delegate complex research to `research-agent`\n3. Engineers: Implement in parallel\n4. QA: Test workflows and edge cases\n5. Reviewer: Review for quality\n6. Docs: Update documentation\n7. Main: Final approval\n\n### Bug Fix\n1. Main: Analyze and prioritize\n2. QA: Reproduce and identify root cause\n3. Engineer: Implement minimal fix\n4. Reviewer: Check for regressions\n5. QA: Validate resolution\n\n### Code Quality\n1. Implementation complete → `code-reviewer` reviews\n2. Issues found → Return to engineer\n3. Quality approved → `qa-agent` validates\n4. Tests pass → `docs-maintainer` updates docs\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- Require evidence, not just \"PASS\"\n- Complex features need multi-agent validation\n- Agents stay within specialization boundaries\n- Demand specific progress reports with details\n\n## Git Commit Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER add watermarks or signatures** to commit messages\n- Write clear, concise commit messages focused on what changed and why\n- Keep commits atomic and focused on single concerns\n- No \"Generated with\" or \"Co-Authored-By\" footers unless explicitly requested\n\n## After Running `/orchestrate`:\n\n1. Assess context and requirements\n2. Identify needed agents and optimal sequence\n3. Begin delegating - maintain oversight throughout\n"
