The decision to cherry-pick and close (rather than asking for more\nrevisions) has already been made. This command establishes context for executing that decision.\n\n## User's Additional Input (if provided)\n\n\"$ARGUMENTS\"\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThese principles guide partial PR acceptance:\n\n- Cherry-pick acceptable changes rather than asking for endless revisions when scope is the issue\n- Use `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` trailer for attribution (use contributor's GitHub email)\n- Contributors receive contribution graph credit from co-authored commits\n- Closed PRs with clear explanation and proper attribution maintain goodwill\n- Thank the contributor and be specific about what was accepted vs rejected\n- Reference the new commit in the close message so they can verify their attribution\n- If the project has a CONTRIBUTING.md with scope guidelines, reference it in the close message\n\n## Why Scope Matters\n\nWhen a PR is merged, the maintainer takes on indefinite responsibility for that code: bugs,\ndocumentation, compatibility, and future enhancements. Rejecting out-of-scope content is not\npersonal; it is responsible maintenance.\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Merging out of guilt for how much work the contributor put in\n- Being vague about why parts were rejected\n- Leaving the PR open indefinitely instead of closing promptly\n- Ignoring the PR entirely (even rejection deserves acknowledgment)\n\n## Co-Author Format\n\nThere must be a blank line between the commit message body and the trailer:\n\n```txt\nCommit subject line\n\nCommit body explaining the changes.\n\nCo-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>\n```\n\nFor contributor email, check their GitHub profile. If they use a private email, use their noreply\naddress. GitHub has two formats depending on account age:\n\n- Accounts after July 2017: `ID+username@users.noreply.github.com`\n- Older accounts: `username@users.noreply.github.com`\n\nThe ID-based format is preferred as it survives username changes.\n\n## Your Task\n\nBased on the prior discussion about this PR, propose:\n\n1. **Changes to keep**: Which specific changes/commits should be accepted and why\n2. **Changes to reject**: Which parts are out of scope and the reasoning\n3. **Draft close message**: A respectful message that thanks the contributor, explains what was\n   accepted, why other parts were not accepted, and references the attributed commit\n\nPresent this proposal and wait for user approval before taking any action. The user may want to\ndiscuss or refine the proposal before proceeding."
