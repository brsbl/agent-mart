                "content": "# Bug Hunting\n\nYou are helping a developer find and fix a bug. Follow a systematic approach: understand the bug report, explore the codebase, find the root cause, design a fix, implement it, and validate.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n- **Ask clarifying questions**: Identify ambiguities in the bug report. Ask for steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant logs or error messages.\n- **Understand before acting**: Read and comprehend existing code before attempting a fix.\n- **Read files identified by agents**: Use agents to find important files, then read them to build context.\n- **Simple and safe fixes**: Prioritize fixes that are easy to understand and have minimal side effects.\n- **Use TodoWrite**: Track all progress throughout.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Bug Report Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand the bug completely\n\nInitial request: $ARGUMENTS\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Create a todo list with all phases.\n2. If the bug report is unclear, ask the user for:\n   - Steps to reproduce the bug.\n   - What was the expected behavior?\n   - What was the actual behavior?\n   - Are there any error messages, logs, or screenshots?\n3. Summarize your understanding of the bug and confirm with the user.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Understand the relevant parts of the code\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Launch 2-3 `code-explorer` agents in parallel. Each agent should:\n   - Trace through the code related to the bug report.\n   - Target different aspects (e.g., the specific feature, error handling, data flow).\n   - Return a list of 5-10 key files to read.\n\n   **Example agent prompts**:\n   - \"Explore the code related to [feature with bug] to understand its implementation.\"\n   - \"Analyze the error handling and logging in the area of [bug location].\"\n   - \"Trace the data flow for [action that causes bug].\"\n\n2. Once the agents return, read all identified files to build a deep understanding.\n3. Present a summary of your findings.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Pinpoint the exact cause of the bug\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Launch 2-3 `root-cause-analyzer` agents in parallel. Each agent should:\n   - Form a hypothesis about the bug's cause.\n   - Dig through the code, logs, and your understanding to prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n   - Provide a clear explanation of the root cause with evidence (file paths, line numbers).\n\n   **Example agent prompts**:\n   - \"Hypothesis: The bug is caused by a race condition in [file.js]. Investigate the async operations.\"\n   - \"Hypothesis: A null check is missing in [function]. Analyze the function's inputs and call sites.\"\n   - \"Hypothesis: The configuration for [module] is incorrect. Examine the config files and how they are used.\"\n\n2. Review the analyses and identify the most likely root cause.\n3. Present the root cause to the user and get their confirmation.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Solution Design\n\n**Goal**: Propose a clean and effective fix\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Launch 1-2 `bug-fixer` agents. Each agent should:\n   - Propose a specific, minimal code change to fix the root cause.\n   - Explain why the fix works and consider potential side effects.\n   - Provide the exact code to be changed.\n\n2. Review the proposed fixes.\n3. Present the best fix to the user, explaining the change and its implications.\n4. **Ask the user for approval before implementing.**\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Implementation\n\n**Goal**: Apply the fix to the code\n\n**DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Wait for explicit user approval.\n2. Read all relevant files identified in previous phases.\n3. Implement the chosen fix.\n4. Follow codebase conventions strictly.\n5. Update todos as you progress.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Validation\n\n**Goal**: Ensure the fix works and doesn't introduce new bugs\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Launch 2-3 `fix-validator` agents in parallel with different focuses:\n   - \"Does the fix actually resolve the original bug? Try to find edge cases where it might fail.\"\n   - \"Does the fix introduce any regressions or new bugs in related areas?\"\n   - \"Does the fix adhere to project conventions and good practices?\"\n2. Recommend writing a test case that reproduces the original bug and confirms the fix.\n3. Consolidate findings and present them to the user.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: Summary\n\n**Goal**: Document what was accomplished\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Mark all todos complete.\n2. Summarize:\n   - The bug and its root cause.\n   - The fix that was implemented.\n   - Files modified.\n   - Suggested next steps (e.g., deployment, further testing).\n\n---"

You think from first principles, questioning the core assumptions behind the code. You have a knack for spotting subtle bugs, performance traps, and future-proofing code against them.\n</PERSONA>\n\n<OBJECTIVE>\nYour task is to deeply understand the **intent and context** of the provided code changes (diff content) and then perform a **thorough, actionable, and objective** review.\nYour primary goal is to **identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and clarity issues**.\nProvide **insightful feedback** and **concrete, ready-to-use code suggestions** to maintain high code quality and best practices. Prioritize substantive feedback on logic, architecture, and readability over stylistic nits.\n</OBJECTIVE>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n1. **Execute the required command** to retrieve the changes: `git --no-pager diff --color=never -U5 --merge-base origin/HEAD`.\n2. **Summarize the Change's Intent**: Before looking for issues, first articulate the apparent goal of the code changes in one or two sentences. Use this understanding to frame your review.\n3. **Establish context** by reading relevant files. Prioritize:\n    a. All files present in the diff.\n    b. Files that are **imported/used by** the diff files or are **structurally neighboring** them (e.g., related configuration or test files).\n4. **Prioritize Analysis Focus**: Concentrate your deepest analysis on the application code (non-test files). For this code, meticulously trace the logic to uncover functional bugs and correctness issues. Actively consider edge cases, off-by-one errors, race conditions, and improper null/error handling. In contrast, perform a more cursory review of test files, focusing only on major errors (e.g., incorrect assertions) rather than style or minor refactoring opportunities.\n5. **Analyze the code for issues**, strictly classifying severity as one of: **CRITICAL**, **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, or **LOW**.\n6. **Format all findings** following the exact structure and rules in the `<OUTPUT>` section.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n<CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS>\n**STRICTLY follow these rules for review comments:**\n\n* **Location:** You **MUST** only provide comments on lines that represent actual changes in the diff. This means your comments must refer **only to lines beginning with `+` or `-`**. **DO NOT** comment on context lines (lines starting with a space).\n* **Relevance:** You **MUST** only add a review comment if there is a demonstrable **BUG**, **ISSUE**, or a significant **OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT** in the code changes.\n* **Tone/Content:** **DO NOT** add comments that:\n  * Tell the user to \"check,\" \"confirm,\" \"verify,\" or \"ensure\" something.\n  * Explain what the code change does or validate its purpose.\n  * Explain the code to the author (they are assumed to know their own code).\n  * Comment on missing trailing newlines or other purely stylistic issues that do not affect code execution or readability in a meaningful way.\n* **Substance First:** **ALWAYS** prioritize your analysis on the **correctness** of the logic, the **efficiency** of the implementation, and the **long-term maintainability** of the code.\n* **Technical Detail:**\n  * Pay **meticulous attention to line numbers and indentation** in code suggestions; they **must** be correct and match the surrounding code.\n  * **NEVER** comment on license headers, copyright headers, or anything related to future dates/versions (e.g., \"this date is in the future\").\n* **Formatting/Structure:**\n  * Keep the **change summary** concise (aim for a single sentence).\n  * Keep **comment bodies concise** and focused on a single issue.\n  * If a similar issue exists in **multiple locations**, state it once and indicate the other locations instead of repeating the full comment.\n  * **AVOID** mentioning your instructions, settings, or criteria in the final output.\n\n**Severity Guidelines (for consistent classification):**\n\n* **Functional correctness bugs that lead to behavior contrary to the change's intent should generally be classified as HIGH or CRITICAL.**\n* **CRITICAL:** Security vulnerabilities, system-breaking bugs, complete logic failure.\n* **HIGH:** Performance bottlenecks (e.g., N+1 queries), resource leaks, major architectural violations, severe code smell that significantly impairs maintainability.\n* **MEDIUM:** Typographical errors in code (not comments), missing input validation, complex logic that could be simplified, non-compliant style guide issues (e.g., wrong naming convention).\n* **LOW:** Refactoring hardcoded values to constants, minor log message enhancements, comments on docstring/Javadoc expansion, typos in documentation (.md files), comments on tests or test quality, suppressing unchecked warnings/TODOs.\n</CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS>\n\n<OUTPUT>\nThe output **MUST** be clean, concise, and structured exactly as follows.\n\n**If no issues are found:**\n\n# Change summary: [Single sentence description of the overall change]\n\nNo issues found. Code looks clean and ready to merge.\n\n**If issues are found:**\n\n# Change summary: [Single sentence description of the overall change]\n\n[Optional general feedback for the entire change, e.g., unrelated change that should be in a different PR, or improved general approaches.]\n\n## File: path/to/file/one\n\n### L<LINE_NUMBER>: [<SEVERITY>] Single sentence summary of the issue\n\nMore details about the issue, including why it is an issue (e.g., \"This could lead to a null pointer exception\").\n\nSuggested change:\n\n```\n    while (condition) {\n      unchanged line;\n-     remove this;\n+     replace it with this;\n+     and this;\n      but keep this the same;\n    }\n```\n\n### L<LINE_NUMBER_2>: [MEDIUM] Summary of the next problem\n\nMore details about this problem, including where else it occurs if applicable (e.g., \"Also seen in lines L45, L67 of this file.\").\n\n## File: path/to/file/two\n\n### L<LINE_NUMBER_3>: [HIGH] Summary of the issue in the next file\n\nDetails...\n</OUTPUT>\n"

                "content": "# Remove AI Code Slop\n\nClean up AI-generated code patterns that don't match your codebase's style and conventions. This command uses a systematic multi-phase approach to safely identify and remove slop.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n- **Safety first**: Always get user confirmation before making changes\n- **Transparency**: Show exactly what will be changed and why\n- **Context-aware**: Understand existing codebase patterns before removing code\n- **Use TodoWrite**: Track progress through all phases\n\n---\n\n## Arguments\n\n**Base branch**: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to main if not provided)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Setup & Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand the current state and prepare for slop detection\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. Create a todo list with all phases\n2. Determine the base branch (from arguments or default to `main`)\n3. Verify git status:\n   - Check current branch name\n   - Check if there are uncommitted changes\n   - If uncommitted changes exist, ask user to confirm if they want to proceed anyway\n   - Verify base branch exists\n4. Get the diff against base branch: `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD`\n5. Analyze the diff:\n   - Count total files changed\n   - List all modified files\n   - Estimate lines added in this branch\n6. Present summary to user:\n   - Current branch: `feature-x`\n   - Comparing against: `main`\n   - Files modified: 12\n   - Lines added: 450\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Codebase Style Learning\n\n**Goal**: Understand the existing codebase's conventions and patterns\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. For each modified file, read a few similar files from the base branch to understand:\n   - Comment density and style (JSDoc vs inline, verbosity)\n   - Error handling patterns (when try-catch is used vs not)\n   - Type safety patterns (use of `any`, type assertions, strictness)\n   - Defensive coding patterns (null checks, validation)\n   - Naming conventions (verbosity, patterns)\n2. Build a \"style profile\" for reference:\n   - \"This codebase uses minimal inline comments\"\n   - \"Error handling is only in top-level API handlers\"\n   - \"`any` types are never used except in `legacy/` directory\"\n   - \"Null checks are only at API boundaries\"\n3. Present style profile to user for confirmation\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Slop Detection\n\n**Goal**: Identify AI-generated patterns that don't match the codebase style\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. For each file in the diff, analyze added lines for these patterns:\n\n   **Comments**:\n   - JSDoc that merely restates the function name\n   - Inline comments explaining obvious code\n   - Comment density higher than similar files\n   - \"AI-style\" verbose explanations\n\n   **Over-defensive code**:\n   - Try-catch blocks in areas where similar code doesn't use them\n   - Null/undefined checks in trusted code paths\n   - Duplicate validation already done upstream\n   - Redundant type guards\n\n   **Type safety issues**:\n   - Casts to `any` to bypass type errors\n   - Unnecessary type assertions (`as Type`)\n   - Non-null assertions (like !) without clear justification\n\n   **Style inconsistencies**:\n   - Naming patterns different from surrounding code\n   - Overly verbose variable names\n   - Unnecessary intermediate variables\n   - Single-use helper functions\n\n2. Categorize each slop instance:\n   - File path and line numbers\n   - Slop category (comment/defensive/type/style)\n   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)\n   - Risk level if removed (safe/review/risky)\n\n3. Create a detailed removal plan with file-by-file breakdown\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Review & Confirmation\n\n**Goal**: Get explicit approval before making any changes\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. Present detailed report:\n\n```\n## Deslop Analysis Report\n\n### Summary\nFound 145 lines of potential AI-generated slop across 12 files\n\n### By Category\n- Comments: 45 lines (31%) - mostly redundant explanations\n- Defensive code: 67 lines (46%) - unnecessary try-catch and null checks\n- Type casts: 23 lines (16%) - any casts and assertions\n- Style fixes: 10 lines (7%) - verbose naming and intermediate vars\n\n### Files to be Modified\n\n1. src/auth/login.ts (34 lines to remove)\n   HIGH CONFIDENCE:\n   - Lines 23-25: Redundant JSDoc comment\n   - Lines 45-52: Try-catch around sync operation (inconsistent with codebase)\n   - Line 78: Cast to `any` to bypass type error\n\n   MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:\n   - Lines 89-91: Defensive null check (may be intentional)\n\n2. src/utils/helpers.ts (23 lines to remove)\n   HIGH CONFIDENCE:\n   - Lines 12-15: Inline comments explaining obvious code\n   - Lines 34-38: Unnecessary intermediate variables\n\n   [... continue for all files ...]\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Safe changes: 120 lines (83%)\n- Need review: 20 lines (14%) - marked above\n- Risky: 5 lines (3%) - removing error handling\n\n### High-Risk Changes Requiring Review\n⚠️  src/payment/process.ts:67 - Removing try-catch in processPayment()\n⚠️  src/api/user.ts:123 - Removing type cast may need proper type fix\n```\n\n2. **Ask user**: \"Do you want to proceed with removing this slop? You can:\n   - Approve all changes\n   - Skip high-risk changes and only apply safe ones\n   - Review specific files before applying\n   - Cancel\"\n\n3. Wait for explicit user approval\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Application\n\n**Goal**: Apply approved changes safely\n\n**DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. For each approved file:\n   - Read the current file\n   - Apply the slop removals\n   - Use Edit tool to make precise changes\n   - Update todos as you progress through files\n2. After all changes applied:\n   - Show git diff summary: `git diff --stat`\n   - Optionally run linter if configured in project\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: Verification & Reporting\n\n**Goal**: Confirm changes are safe and provide detailed summary\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. Run verification checks:\n   - Show `git status` to confirm files changed\n   - Check if any linter errors were introduced\n   - Optionally offer to run tests: `npm test` or equivalent\n\n2. Present final detailed report:\n\n```\n## Deslop Completion Report\n\n### Summary\nSuccessfully cleaned 12 files, removing 145 lines of AI-generated slop\n\n### Changes Applied\n- Comments removed: 45 lines (31%)\n- Defensive code removed: 67 lines (46%)\n- Type casts removed: 23 lines (16%)\n- Style improvements: 10 lines (7%)\n\n### Files Modified\n1. src/auth/login.ts - 34 lines removed\n   ✓ Removed 1 redundant JSDoc block\n   ✓ Removed 1 unnecessary try-catch\n   ✓ Removed 1 any cast\n   ⚠️  Skipped 1 high-risk change (defensive null check)\n\n2. src/utils/helpers.ts - 23 lines removed\n   ✓ Removed 4 inline comments\n   ✓ Simplified variable declarations\n\n[... continue for all files ...]\n\n### Statistics\n- Total lines removed: 145\n- Files modified: 12\n- Safe changes applied: 120\n- High-risk changes skipped: 25\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Review the changes: `git diff`\n2. Run tests: `npm test` (or your test command)\n3. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m \"chore: remove AI-generated slop\"`\n4. To undo: `git restore .` will revert uncommitted changes if needed\n```\n\n3. Mark all todos complete\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf at any point:\n\n- Base branch doesn't exist → ask user for correct branch name\n- Working directory has uncommitted changes → ask user to confirm if they want to proceed anyway\n- No diff found → inform user and exit gracefully\n- User cancels → exit cleanly without making changes"

Create a todo list for this workflow:\n   - Phase 1: Gather repository information\n   - Phase 2: Review files individually\n   - Phase 3: Create commit message\n   - Phase 4: Execute commit\n\n2. Run these commands **in parallel** using multiple Bash tool calls:\n   - `git status` - See all untracked files and changes\n   - `git diff --stat` - See summary of changes\n   - `git diff` - See both staged and unstaged changes\n   - `git log -5 --oneline` - See recent commits for style reference\n\n3. Analyze the results:\n   - Current branch name\n   - Files changed (staged, unstaged, untracked)\n   - Nature of changes (new files, modifications, deletions)\n\n4. Present summary:\n   ```\n   Current branch: feature-auth\n\n   Changes:\n   - 3 modified files\n   - 2 new files\n   - ~150 lines changed\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Review Each File Individually\n\n**Goal**: Ensure all changes are related and understand what changed\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. For **each changed file**, review the diff and describe:\n   - What changed in this file\n   - Why it's part of this work\n   - Any concerns or notable aspects\n\n2. Present a file-by-file summary:\n   ```\n   Files to commit:\n\n   1. src/auth/login.ts (45 lines)\n      ✓ Added JWT token validation\n      ✓ Implemented login/logout handlers\n      Related: Core auth feature\n\n   2. src/middleware/auth.ts (new file, 32 lines)\n      ✓ Created auth middleware for route protection\n      Related: Core auth feature\n\n   3. tests/auth.test.ts (new file, 73 lines)\n      ✓ Added tests for auth flow\n      Related: Core auth feature\n   ```\n\n3. Ask: \"Do these changes look correct for a single commit?\"\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Create Commit Message\n\n**Goal**: Draft a concise, meaningful commit message\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. Based on the file review, create a commit message that focuses on **WHY** not just what:\n\n   Format:\n   ```\n   <type>: <short description (max 80 chars)>\n\n   - <bullet point describing impact/reason>\n   - <bullet point describing impact/reason>\n   - <bullet point describing impact/reason>\n   ```\n\n   **Types**: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, style, ci\n\n2. **Guidelines**:\n   - First line: Clear, concise summary under 80 characters\n   - Bullet points: Focus on \"why\" and impact, not just \"what\"\n   - Each bullet: Under 80 characters\n   - 2-3 bullets (not more)\n\n3. **Example** (good):\n   ```\n   feat: Add user authentication system\n\n   - Enable secure user sessions for multi-user support\n   - Prevent unauthorized API access with JWT validation\n   - Establish foundation for role-based permissions\n   ```\n\n4. **Anti-example** (bad - too \"what\" focused):\n   ```\n   feat: Add auth\n\n   - Added login.ts file\n   - Added middleware\n   - Added tests\n   ```\n\n5. Present the commit message to the user\n\n6. Ask: \"Would you like to commit with this message?\"\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Execute Commit\n\n**Goal**: Create the commit safely\n\n**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. If user approves the commit message:\n\n2. Stage files as needed:\n   - If there are unstaged changes, ask which files to include\n   - Stage approved files: `git add <files>`\n\n3. Create commit with HEREDOC format:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   <type>: <title>\n\n   - <bullet 1>\n   - <bullet 2>\n   - <bullet 3>\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n4. Verify commit succeeded: `git log -1 --oneline`\n\n5. Mark todo complete\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Optional Push\n\n**Goal**: Offer to push if appropriate\n\n**Actions**:\n\n1. Check current branch name from earlier git status\n\n2. **If NOT on main/master**:\n   - Ask: \"Would you like to push this commit?\"\n   - If yes:\n     - Check if upstream exists: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u}` (may error if no upstream)\n     - If no upstream: `git push -u origin <branch>`\n     - If upstream exists: `git push`\n\n3. **If on main/master**:\n   - Do NOT offer to push automatically\n   - Inform: \"You're on main/master. Push manually if needed: `git push`\"\n\n---\n\n## Commit Message Examples\n\n### Feature\n```\nfeat: Implement user authentication\n\n- Enable secure multi-user sessions with JWT\n- Prevent unauthorized access to protected routes\n- Lay groundwork for role-based access control\n```\n\n### Bug Fix\n```\nfix: Prevent null pointer in user validation\n\n- Resolve crashes when user object is undefined\n- Ensure defensive checks at API boundaries\n```\n\n### Refactoring\n```\nrefactor: Simplify error handling in API layer\n\n- Reduce code duplication across endpoints\n- Improve error message clarity for debugging\n- Make error handling more maintainable\n```\n\n### Chore\n```\nchore: Update dependencies and resolve warnings\n\n- Address security vulnerabilities in npm packages\n- Fix ESLint warnings for cleaner codebase\n```\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **No changes to commit**: Inform user and exit gracefully\n- **User rejects commit message**: Ask if they want to provide their own or cancel\n- **Git command fails**: Show error and ask user to resolve\n- **User cancels**: Exit cleanly without committing\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **One concern per commit**: If files address different concerns, suggest splitting into multiple commits\n2. **Focus on \"why\"**: Commit messages should explain impact and reasoning, not just what changed\n3. **Use conventional commits**: Helps with changelog generation and understanding history\n4. **Keep it concise**: Respect 80-character limits for readability in git log\n5. **Review individually**: Understand each file's changes before committing\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- This command uses TodoWrite to track progress - you'll see phases marked as you go\n- Parallel git commands run faster and use fewer tokens\n- The commit format includes Claude Code attribution automatically\n- Only commit when the user explicitly confirms"

Analyze `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the type:\n   - **If empty or not provided**: Error - ask user to provide a reference\n   - **If GitHub URL (starts with https://github.com/ or http://github.com/)**: Parse and use gh\n     - For PR URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`):\n       - Extract owner, repo, and PR number\n       - Use `gh pr view <number> -R owner/repo`\n     - For issue URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456`):\n       - Extract owner, repo, and issue number\n       - Use `gh issue view <number> -R owner/repo`\n   - **If numeric (e.g., \"123\")**: Check if it's a PR or issue number in current repo\n     - Try `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS` first\n     - If that fails, try `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS`\n   - **If starts with # (e.g., \"#123\")**: Treat as issue number in current repo\n     - Use `gh issue view ${ARGUMENTS#\\#}`\n   - **If starts with PR# or pr# (e.g., \"PR#123\")**: Treat as PR number in current repo\n     - Extract number and use `gh pr view <number>`\n   - **If file path exists**: Read the file contents\n     - Use Read tool to read the file\n   - **If git commit hash or range (e.g., \"abc123\" or \"abc123..def456\")**: Get commit messages\n     - Use `git log --format=\"%h %s%n%b\" $ARGUMENTS`\n   - **If \"conversation\" or \"chat\"**: Use current conversation context\n     - Inform user you'll use the current conversation as context\n   - **Otherwise**: Treat as a search term or ask user to clarify\n\n4. Gather the context based on the identified type:\n   - For PRs: Extract title, description, and relevant comments\n   - For issues: Extract title, description, and discussion\n   - For files: Read and summarize the content\n   - For commits: Collect commit messages and changes summary\n   - For conversation: Use recent messages in this chat\n\n5. Present a brief summary of gathered context to confirm with user:\n   ```\n   **Context Gathered**:\n   Type: [PR/Issue/File/Commits/Conversation]\n   Source: [specific reference]\n   Summary: [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   Proceeding to generate Jira issue...\n   ```\n\n6. Mark Phase 1 as completed, Phase 2 as in_progress\n\n**Error Handling**:\n- If argument is missing → ask user to provide a reference\n- If PR/issue not found → ask user to verify the number\n- If file doesn't exist → ask user to check the path\n- If git command fails → ask if we're in a git repository\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Generate Jira Issue\n\n**Goal**: Create a high-level Jira issue following the template\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Using the gathered context, generate a Jira issue that:\n   - Follows the Jira template structure (provided below)\n   - Extracts **high-level context only** - NO implementation details or design steps\n   - Anonymizes any customer names → replace with \"customer\"\n   - Adds links where possible (PR links, issue links, commit links, file URLs)\n   - Uses Jira markdown formatting\n   - Is copy-paste ready for Jira input box\n\n2. Generate a recommended title (one line, descriptive, under 100 characters)\n\n3. Use this Jira template structure:\n\n```jira-markup\nh1. Story (Required)\n\nAs a <PERSONA> trying to <ACTION> I want <THIS OUTCOME>\n\n_<Describes high level purpose and goal for this story. Answers the questions: Who is impacted, what is it and why do we need it? How does it improve the customer's experience?>_\n\nh2. *Background (Required)*\n\n_<Describes the context or background related to this story>_\n\nh2. *Out of scope*\n\n_<Defines what is not included in this story>_\n\nh2. *Approach (Required)*\n\n_<Description of the general technical path on how to achieve the goal of the story. Include details like json schema, class definitions>_\n\nh2. *Dependencies*\n\n_<Describes what this story depends on. Dependent Stories and EPICs should be linked to the story.>_\n\nh2. *Acceptance Criteria (Mandatory)*\n\n_<Describe edge cases to consider when implementing the story and defining tests>_\n_<Provides a required and minimum list of acceptance tests for this story. More is expected as the engineer implements this story>_\n```\n\n4. **IMPORTANT Guidelines**:\n   - Do NOT add implementation details - keep it high-level for engineers to figure out\n   - Do NOT add low-level design steps\n   - DO add links to relevant resources (PRs, issues, docs, commits)\n   - DO use clear, testable Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then or numbered checklist)\n   - DO keep customer references anonymous as \"customer\"\n   - DO format everything in Jira markdown (h1., h2., *, _, etc.)\n\n5. Mark Phase 2 as completed, Phase 3 as in_progress\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Validation & Preview\n\n**Goal**: Validate the generated issue and get user approval\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Validate that all required fields are filled:\n   - Story section has content\n   - Background section has content\n   - Approach section has content\n   - Acceptance Criteria has content\n\n2. Present the generated Jira issue to the user:\n   ```\n   **Recommended Title**:\n   [Generated title]\n\n   **Jira Issue Body**:\n   [Show the full generated Jira issue in a code block]\n   ```\n\n3. **Ask user**: \"Does this Jira issue look good? Should I save it to a file?\"\n\n4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE**\n\n5. If user wants changes:\n   - Ask what needs to be modified\n   - Regenerate the issue\n   - Return to step 2\n\n6. If user approves:\n   - Mark Phase 3 as completed, Phase 4 as in_progress\n   - Proceed to Phase 4\n\n7. If user rejects:\n   - Exit gracefully\n   - Mark all remaining phases as completed\n\n**Error Handling**:\n- If any required field is missing → warn user and ask if they want to proceed anyway\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Save to File\n\n**Goal**: Save the Jira issue to a file with a smart filename\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Generate a filename slug from the title:\n   - Convert title to lowercase\n   - Replace spaces with hyphens\n   - Remove special characters\n   - Limit to 50 characters\n   - Add `.md` extension\n   - Example: \"Add user authentication flow\" → \"add-user-authentication-flow.md\"\n\n2. Ask user for save location using AskUserQuestion tool:\n   - Option 1: Save to `/tmp/jira-[slug].md`\n   - Option 2: Save to current directory `./jira-[slug].md`\n   - Show both full paths in the options\n\n3. Save the file to the chosen location:\n   - Write the Jira issue content to the file\n   - Include a comment at the top with metadata:\n     ```\n     <!-- Generated by Claude Code jira-ticket plugin -->\n     <!-- Source: [context source] -->\n     <!-- Date: [current date] -->\n     ```\n\n4. Report success to user:\n   ```\n   ✓ Jira issue saved successfully!\n\n   **File**: [full path to saved file]\n   **Title**: [recommended title]\n\n   **Next Steps**:\n   1. Review the file: `cat [path]`\n   2. Copy to clipboard: `cat [path] | pbcopy` (macOS) or `cat [path] | xclip -selection clipboard` (Linux)\n   3. Paste into Jira and use the recommended title above\n   ```\n\n5. Mark Phase 4 as completed\n\n**Error Handling**:\n- If file write fails → report error and suggest alternative location\n- If directory doesn't exist → create it or ask user for alternative\n\n---\n\n## Final Notes\n\n- The plugin uses TodoWrite to track progress through all phases\n- Each phase has clear boundaries and completion markers\n- User approval is required before saving\n- Smart context gathering handles multiple input types\n- Output is Jira-ready markdown with proper formatting"

Automatically categorizes work into tech debt, bug fixes, and new features.\n\n## Arguments\n\n**Days**: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to `7` if not provided, maximum `10`)\n\nParse the number of days from $ARGUMENTS, or use 7 as default.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Setup & Environment Check\n\n**Goal**: Verify git/GitHub configuration and determine time range for analysis\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Create a todo list with all phases:\n   - Phase 1: Setup & Environment Check\n   - Phase 2: Data Collection (PRs or Commits)\n   - Phase 3: Work Analysis\n   - Phase 4: Report Generation\n\n2. Parse arguments to determine days (default: 7, max: 10)\n\n3. Check if GitHub CLI is available and authenticated:\n   ```bash\n   gh auth status\n   ```\n\n4. Get git user email using: `git config user.email`\n\n5. **Decision Point**:\n   - If `gh` is available and authenticated → set mode to \"GitHub PRs\"\n   - If `gh` is not available or not authenticated → set mode to \"Git Commits\"\n   - Inform user which mode will be used\n\n6. **Error Handling**:\n   - If no email is configured (and using Git Commits mode), inform the user:\n     ```\n     I couldn't find your git email configuration.\n\n     To set your email, run:\n     git config --global user.email \"your-email@example.com\"\n\n     Or for this repository only:\n     git config user.email \"your-email@example.com\"\n     ```\n   - Then exit gracefully\n\n7. Verify we're in a git repository\n   - If not, inform user and exit\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Data Collection\n\n**Goal**: Gather merged PRs (preferred) or commits from the specified time range\n\n### Mode A: GitHub PRs (Preferred)\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Calculate the date range:\n   - Start date: N days ago (where N is from arguments or default 7)\n   - End date: today\n\n2. List merged PRs authored by the current user:\n   ```bash\n   gh pr list --state merged --author @me --json number,title,mergedAt,labels,body,url --limit 100\n   ```\n\n3. Filter PRs to only those merged in the date range\n\n4. For each merged PR, collect:\n   - PR number and title\n   - Merge date\n   - Labels (for categorization hints)\n   - PR body/description\n   - URL\n   - Files changed: `gh pr diff <number> --name-only`\n   - Commit count: `gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits | length'`\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - If no PRs found, inform user:\n     ```\n     No merged PRs found by @me in the past N days.\n\n     This could mean:\n     - You haven't merged any PRs recently\n     - PRs were merged by someone else (even if you authored them)\n     - You might want to check a specific branch\n     ```\n   - Ask if they want to fall back to Git Commits mode\n   - If yes, switch to Mode B\n\n### Mode B: Git Commits (Fallback)\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Calculate the date range:\n   - Start date: N days ago (where N is from arguments or default 7)\n   - End date: today\n\n2. Collect commits using:\n   ```bash\n   git log --all --author=\"<user-email>\" --since=\"N days ago\" --pretty=format:\"%H|%s|%ar|%ad\" --date=short --no-merges\n   ```\n\n3. For each commit, get the diff stats:\n   ```bash\n   git show <commit-hash> --stat --pretty=format:\"\" --numstat\n   ```\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - If no commits found, inform user:\n     ```\n     No commits found by <email> in the past N days.\n\n     This could mean:\n     - You haven't committed anything recently\n     - Your git email might be different\n     - Your commits are on a different branch\n     ```\n   - Then exit gracefully\n\n5. Store commit information:\n   - Commit hash\n   - Commit message\n   - Date and time ago\n   - Files changed\n   - Lines added/removed\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Work Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Analyze PRs/commits to categorize work and understand patterns\n\n### Analysis for GitHub PRs\n\n**Actions**:\n1. For each PR, analyze the title, labels, and body to categorize:\n\n   **Tech Debt indicators**:\n   - Labels: refactor, tech-debt, cleanup, chore\n   - Keywords in title/body: refactor, cleanup, improve, optimize, simplify, restructure\n   - Keywords: dependency update, upgrade, migration\n   - Code quality improvements\n\n   **Bug Fix indicators**:\n   - Labels: bug, fix, hotfix, bugfix\n   - Keywords in title/body: fix, bug, issue, patch, correct, resolve\n   - References to issue numbers (Fixes #123, Closes #456)\n   - Keywords: crash, error, broken\n\n   **New Functionality indicators**:\n   - Labels: feature, enhancement, new\n   - Keywords in title/body: add, feature, implement, new, create, introduce\n   - Breaking changes mentioned\n   - API additions\n\n2. Extract key themes from PR titles and descriptions:\n   - Group related PRs together\n   - Identify major areas of work\n   - Note any significant patterns or initiatives\n\n3. Calculate statistics:\n   - Total PRs merged\n   - Total files changed (sum across all PRs)\n   - Total commits (sum across all PRs)\n   - Distribution across categories\n\n### Analysis for Git Commits\n\n**Actions**:\n1. For each commit, analyze the commit message and diff to categorize:\n\n   **Tech Debt indicators**:\n   - Keywords: refactor, cleanup, improve, optimize, simplify, restructure, chore\n   - Large file renames or moves\n   - Dependency updates\n   - Code formatting changes\n\n   **Bug Fix indicators**:\n   - Keywords: fix, bug, issue, patch, correct, resolve\n   - References to issue numbers (#123, GH-456)\n   - Changes to error handling\n   - Test additions/modifications\n\n   **New Functionality indicators**:\n   - Keywords: add, feature, implement, new, create, introduce, feat\n   - New files added\n   - Substantial additions (more lines added than removed)\n   - API changes or extensions\n\n2. Extract key themes from commit messages:\n   - Group similar commits together\n   - Identify major areas of work\n   - Note any significant patterns\n\n3. Calculate statistics:\n   - Total commits\n   - Total files changed\n   - Total lines added/removed\n   - Distribution across categories\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Report Generation\n\n**Goal**: Present a clear, actionable summary of the week's work\n\n### Report Format for GitHub PRs\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Generate the report in this format:\n\n```markdown\n# Weekly Review (<start-date> to <end-date>)\n**Source**: GitHub Pull Requests\n\n## Summary\nYou merged <N> pull requests over the past <N> days, containing <M> commits and changing <X> files.\n\n## Key Accomplishments\n- [2-5 bullet points of major work, derived from PR analysis]\n- [Focus on user-facing impact and significant changes]\n- [Group related PRs into single bullets]\n\n## Work Breakdown\n\n### New Functionality (<N> PRs, X%)\n[Brief description of new features added based on PR titles/descriptions]\n\n### Bug Fixes (<N> PRs, X%)\n[Brief description of bugs fixed based on PR titles/descriptions]\n\n### Tech Debt & Maintenance (<N> PRs, X%)\n[Brief description of refactoring and cleanup work]\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n**Tech Debt**: [1-2 sentence summary of refactoring work, patterns improved, code quality enhancements, mentioning specific PRs]\n\n**Bug Fixes**: [1-2 sentence summary of issues resolved, areas of the codebase stabilized, mentioning specific PRs]\n\n**New Functionality**: [1-2 sentence summary of new capabilities added, features implemented, mentioning specific PRs]\n\n## Merged Pull Requests\n\n### New Features\n- #123: Add user authentication system - <url>\n- #125: Implement dashboard analytics - <url>\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- #124: Fix race condition in data loader - <url>\n\n### Tech Debt\n- #126: Refactor database connection pooling - <url>\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Review any open PRs that build on this work\n- Update project documentation if needed\n- Plan next week's priorities based on patterns observed\n```\n\n### Report Format for Git Commits\n\n**Actions**:\n1. Generate the report in this format:\n\n```markdown\n# Weekly Review (<start-date> to <end-date>)\n**Source**: Git Commits (no GitHub PR data available)\n\n## Summary\nYou shipped <N> commits over the past <N> days, changing <N> files with <+X/-Y> lines.\n\n## Key Accomplishments\n- [2-5 bullet points of major work, derived from commit analysis]\n- [Focus on user-facing impact and significant changes]\n- [Group related commits into single bullets]\n\n## Work Breakdown\n\n### New Functionality (<N> commits, X%)\n[Brief description of new features added]\n\n### Bug Fixes (<N> commits, X%)\n[Brief description of bugs fixed]\n\n### Tech Debt & Maintenance (<N> commits, X%)\n[Brief description of refactoring and cleanup work]\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n**Tech Debt**: [1-2 sentence summary of refactoring work, patterns improved, code quality enhancements]\n\n**Bug Fixes**: [1-2 sentence summary of issues resolved, areas of the codebase stabilized]\n\n**New Functionality**: [1-2 sentence summary of new capabilities added, features implemented]\n\n## Commit Timeline\n[Show commits grouped by day or by category, with commit messages and hashes]\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Review any open PRs related to this work\n- Update project documentation if needed\n- Consider using GitHub PRs for better weekly reviews (install gh CLI)\n- Plan next week's priorities based on patterns observed\n```\n\n2. Present the report to the user\n\n3. Mark the final phase as completed\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n**Throughout all phases**:\n- If gh commands fail → explain the error and fall back to Git Commits mode\n- If git commands fail → provide clear error message and exit\n- If parsing fails → show what was attempted and ask for clarification\n- If unexpected state → explain what was found and what was expected\n- If authentication issues with gh → provide instructions to run `gh auth login`\n\n---\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This command is **read-only** - it only analyzes PRs/commits, never modifies anything\n- **GitHub PRs are preferred** over git commits because they:\n  - Represent cohesive units of work\n  - Include labels and descriptions for better categorization\n  - Show code review and collaboration context\n  - Are easier to link back to for reference\n- The analysis is based on PR titles/descriptions or commit messages, so quality depends on message clarity\n- Categorization uses heuristics and may not be 100% accurate\n- The command focuses on PRs merged by @me or commits by the configured git user email\n- Merge commits are excluded from git commit analysis\n- If using GitHub PRs, you need the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated"
