A `tasks/` directory exists in the project root\n2. The `00-index.md` file exists\n3. Task files exist with proper format\n\nIf no task breakdown exists, inform the user:\n> \"No task breakdown found. Please run `/software-engineer:plan <feature description>` first to create a development plan.\"\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Select Task\nBased on the argument:\n- If `next`: Find the first task with `status: todo` that has all dependencies marked as `done`\n- If `[number]`: Load that specific task file\n- If `all`: Start with the first available task\n\nIf the selected task has unmet dependencies, notify the user and suggest completing dependencies first.\n\n### Step 2: Begin Task\n1. **Read the task file** completely to understand requirements\n2. **Update task status** to `progress`:\n   - Modify the YAML frontmatter: `status: progress`\n3. **Update 00-index.md** to reflect the status change\n4. **Announce** what you're working on:\n   > \"Starting Task [XX]: [Title]\n   > Priority: [Priority] | Complexity: [Complexity]\n   > \n   > Objectives:\n   > - [objective 1]\n   > - [objective 2]\"\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Project Context\nBefore implementing:\n1. Review existing code patterns and conventions\n2. Check related files that might be affected\n3. Understand the codebase architecture\n4. Identify integration points\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Task\nExecute the implementation following:\n\n1. **Follow project conventions** - Match existing code style, naming conventions, and patterns\n2. **Write clean code** - Apply SOLID principles, DRY, and best practices\n3. **Handle errors properly** - Include appropriate error handling and validation\n4. **Add comments** - Document complex logic and public APIs\n5. **Consider edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and invalid inputs\n\nDuring implementation:\n- Create necessary files and directories\n- Write the implementation code\n- Update any affected existing files\n- Create or update tests if specified in the task\n\n### Step 5: Verify Acceptance Criteria\nAfter implementation, go through each acceptance criterion:\n\n1. **Test each criterion** - Verify it's actually met\n2. **Check the checkboxes** - Update the task file to mark completed criteria:\n   ```markdown\n   - [x] Criterion that is now complete\n   - [ ] Criterion still pending\n   ```\n3. **Run any specified tests** - Ensure tests pass\n4. **Verify integration** - Check the code works with existing components\n\n### Step 6: Complete the Task\nOnce ALL acceptance criteria are verified:\n\n1. **Update task status** to `done`:\n   - Modify the YAML frontmatter: `status: done`\n   - Ensure all acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked\n2. **Update 00-index.md** to reflect completion\n3. **Summarize** what was accomplished:\n   > \"✅ Task [XX]: [Title] - COMPLETED\n   > \n   > Deliverables:\n   > - [what was created/modified]\n   > \n   > Files changed:\n   > - [list of files]\"\n\n### Step 7: Next Steps\nAfter completing a task:\n- If `all` mode: Ask for confirmation before proceeding to next task\n- Otherwise: Suggest the next available task\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n### Code Quality\n- **Match existing patterns** - Don't introduce new patterns unless necessary\n- **Keep it simple** - Prefer clarity over cleverness\n- **Test your work** - Verify code works before marking complete\n- **Don't break existing functionality** - Run existing tests if available\n\n### Task Management\n- **One task at a time** - Focus on completing current task before moving on\n- **Update status accurately** - Keep task files in sync with actual progress\n- **Document blockers** - If you can't complete something, note it in the task file\n- **Respect dependencies** - Don't skip ahead if dependencies aren't met\n\n### Communication\n- **Be transparent** - Explain what you're doing and why\n- **Ask questions** - If requirements are unclear, ask before implementing\n- **Report issues** - If you encounter problems, communicate them clearly\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n1. **Don't leave task in broken state** - Either complete it or revert changes\n2. **Update task file** with notes about what happened\n3. **Inform the user** about the issue and potential solutions\n4. **Suggest next steps** - How to resolve or work around the problem"

Identify the task (from argument or first `progress` task)\n2. Read task file to get title\n3. Generate branch name: `task/XX-task-slug`\n   - Example: `task/05-lexer-tokenizer`\n4. Check if branch already exists\n5. Create and checkout the branch:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b task/XX-task-slug\n   ```\n6. Confirm to user:\n   > \"Created and switched to branch `task/05-lexer-tokenizer`\n   > Ready to work on Task 05: Lexer/Tokenizer\"\n\n**Branch Naming Convention:**\n- Prefix: `task/`\n- Task number: Zero-padded (01, 02, etc.)\n- Slug: Lowercase, hyphenated task title\n- Example: `task/07-stream-reader-base`\n\n### `commit` - Commit Task Progress\n\nCreate a comprehensive commit for the current task work.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Check for uncommitted changes\n2. Identify current task (from branch name or in-progress task)\n3. Analyze changed files and diffs to understand what was modified\n4. Stage all changes (or ask user what to stage)\n5. Auto-generate comprehensive commit message:\n   - Descriptive title (max 50 characters)\n   - Detailed description (3-4 lines max) based on actual code changes\n   - NEVER add acceptance criteria in message body\n   - NEVER add author information in message body\n   - NEVER add generated with/by in message body\n6. Show generated commit message to user for approval\n7. Create the commit after user approval\n8. Confirm to user\n\n**Commit Message Generation Rules:**\n\n1. **Analyze Changes First:**\n   - Read the git diff to understand what changed\n   - Identify which files were modified, added, or deleted\n   - Understand the nature of changes (new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)\n\n2. **Generate Descriptive Title:**\n   - Format: `[Task XX] <type>: <concise description>`\n   - Keep under 50 characters\n   - Use imperative mood (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`\n   - Example: `[Task 05] feat: Add token validation to lexer`\n\n3. **Generate Detailed Description:**\n   - 3-4 lines maximum\n   - Focus on WHAT changed and WHY\n   - Be specific about implementation details\n   - Mention key files or components affected\n   - Do NOT include acceptance criteria\n   - Do NOT include author information\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     Implemented token validation logic in the lexer component to ensure\n     proper syntax checking. Added TokenValidator class with validation rules\n     for identifiers, keywords, and operators. Updated Lexer.php to integrate\n     validation during tokenization process.\n     ```\n\n4. **Review and Approval:**\n   - Display the generated message to user\n   - Ask: \"Is this commit message acceptable? (yes/edit/cancel)\"\n   - If \"edit\": allow user to modify the message\n   - If \"cancel\": abort the commit\n   - If \"yes\": proceed with commit\n\n**Example Commit Message:**\n```\n[Task 05] feat: Add token validation to lexer\n\nImplemented token validation logic in the lexer component to ensure\nproper syntax checking. Added TokenValidator class with validation rules\nfor identifiers, keywords, and operators. Updated Lexer.php to integrate\nvalidation during tokenization process.\n```\n\n**What NOT to Include:**\n- ❌ Acceptance criteria lists\n- ❌ Author names or emails in the message body\n- ❌ Task progress percentages\n- ❌ Generic descriptions like \"Updated code\" or \"Fixed stuff\"\n- ❌ Overly verbose explanations (keep to 3-4 lines)\n\n### `finish` - Complete Task Branch\n\nFinalize work on a task branch.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met\n2. Ensure all changes are committed\n3. Update task status to `done` if not already\n4. Ask user about merge strategy:\n   - Merge to develop/main\n   - Create pull request (provide PR description)\n   - Keep branch for manual merge\n5. If merging:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout main  # or develop\n   git merge --no-ff task/XX-task-slug\n   ```\n6. Optionally delete the task branch\n7. Summarize:\n   > \"✅ Task 05 branch completed and merged to main\n   > Branch `task/05-lexer-tokenizer` has been deleted\n   > \n   > Commits merged: 5\n   > Files changed: 12\"\n\n### `status` - Git Status for Tasks\n\nShow git status in context of task workflow.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n📊 Git Status - Task Workflow\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCurrent Branch: task/05-lexer-tokenizer\nRelated Task: 05 - Lexer/Tokenizer (progress)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nWorking Directory:\n  Modified:  src/Internal/Lexer.php\n  Modified:  tests/Unit/LexerTest.php\n  Untracked: src/Internal/Token.php\n\nStaged:\n  (none)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nTask Branches:\n  ✅ task/01-project-setup (merged)\n  ✅ task/02-config-constants (merged)\n  ✅ task/03-exception-classes (merged)\n  ✅ task/04-buffer-manager (merged)\n  🔄 task/05-lexer-tokenizer (current) - 3 commits ahead\n  📋 task/06-streaming-parser (not created)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSuggestions:\n  → Stage and commit your current changes\n  → Run: /software-engineer:git commit\n```\n\n### `sync` - Sync with Main Branch\n\nKeep task branches up to date with main/develop.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Fetch latest from remote\n2. Identify current task branch\n3. Rebase or merge from main/develop:\n   ```bash\n   git fetch origin\n   git rebase origin/main  # or merge\n   ```\n4. Handle conflicts if any (notify user)\n5. Push updates if remote tracking exists\n\n## Git Best Practices\n\n### Branch Strategy\n- Keep `main` or `develop` as the integration branch\n- One branch per task\n- Merge completed task branches promptly\n- Delete merged branches to keep repo clean\n\n### Commit Practices\n- Commit frequently within a task\n- Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages\n- Reference task number in every commit using `[Task XX]` prefix\n- Keep commits focused and atomic\n- Always analyze changed files and diffs before generating commit messages\n- Use clear, concise titles (max 50 characters)\n- Provide detailed descriptions (3-4 lines) explaining what and why\n- Never include acceptance criteria or author information in commit messages\n- Use conventional commit types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf, style\n- Always request user approval before committing\n\n### Conflict Resolution\n- When conflicts occur, explain the conflict clearly\n- Show both versions of conflicting code\n- Ask user for resolution preference\n- Never auto-resolve without user confirmation\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf git operations fail:\n1. Show the exact error message\n2. Explain what went wrong\n3. Suggest remediation steps\n4. Offer to help fix the issue\n\nCommon issues:\n- Uncommitted changes blocking checkout\n- Merge conflicts\n- Branch already exists\n- Remote push rejected"

[Specific deliverable with details]\n2. [Another deliverable]\n\n## Technical Details\n[Detailed technical information needed to implement this task]\n[Include code examples, API specs, data structures, etc. as needed]\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Task XX - Name] (if applicable)\n- None (if this is a starting task)\n\n## Estimated Complexity\n**[Low|Medium|High]** - [Brief justification]\n\n## Implementation Notes\n[Any additional context, gotchas, or recommendations]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]\n- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]\n- [ ] [All tests pass]\n- [ ] [Code follows project conventions]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Present the Plan\n\nAfter creating all task files, present a summary to the user:\n1. Overview of the task breakdown\n2. Total number of tasks and estimated timeline\n3. Critical path for MVP\n4. Any assumptions made\n5. Questions or clarifications needed\n\nThen ask: **\"Do you approve this task breakdown? If you'd like changes, please let me know. Once approved, run `/software-engineer:develop` to start implementation.\"**\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Be thorough** - Include all necessary tasks, don't skip steps\n- **Be realistic** - Provide honest complexity and time estimates\n- **Be specific** - Acceptance criteria should be concrete and verifiable\n- **Consider edge cases** - Include error handling, validation, and testing tasks\n- **Follow conventions** - Match the existing project's style and patterns\n- **Think about maintainability** - Structure tasks to produce clean, maintainable code"
