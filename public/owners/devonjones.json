Get summary of comments: scripts/summarize-reviews.sh <PR>\n    2. Check for unresolved comments: scripts/get-review-comments.sh <PR> --with-ids --wait\n    3. For EACH comment: evaluate critically, fix if worthwhile, ALWAYS reply with scripts/reply-to-comment.sh <PR> <comment-id> \"Fixed - [description]\" or \"Won't fix - [reason]\"\n    4. Commit and push: scripts/commit-and-push.sh \"fix: address review comments\" (NEVER use raw git commands)\n    5. Trigger next review: scripts/trigger-review.sh <PR> --wait\n    6. Repeat steps 1-5 until no new unresolved comments\n    7. Do ONE MORE verification loop - if no actionable feedback, you're done\n    8. Report back when ready to merge or if user input is needed\n\n    Critical rules:\n    - ALWAYS use commit-and-push.sh, NEVER git commit/push\n    - ALWAYS reply to every comment using reply-to-comment.sh\n    - ALWAYS use --wait flags when polling for reviews (5min timeout)\n    - Be skeptical of review suggestions - not all should be implemented\n    - Track state with TodoWrite (especially \"final verification loop\" todo)\n```\n\nThis keeps the main conversation clean while the agent autonomously handles the review cycles.\n\n---\n\nStreamline the push-review-fix cycle for PRs with automated reviewers.\n\n## Supported Review Bots\n\n| Bot | Trigger | Priority Format |\n|-----|---------|-----------------|\n| **Gemini Code Assist** | `/gemini review` comment | `![critical]`, `![high]`, `![medium]`, `![low]` |\n| **Cursor Bugbot** | Auto on push | `<!-- **High Severity** -->`, `### Bug:` |\n| **Claude** | Manual via script | `**Critical**`, `### Critical Issues` |\n\nPriority detection automatically parses all formats when summarizing and fetching comments.\n\n## Critical: Be Skeptical of Reviews\n\n**Not all suggestions are good.** Evaluate each review comment critically:\n\n- Does this actually improve the code, or is it pedantic?\n- Is this suggestion appropriate for the project's context?\n- Would implementing this introduce unnecessary complexity?\n\n**Skip suggestions that are:**\n- Platform-specific when not applicable (Windows comments for Linux-only code)\n- Overly defensive (excessive null checks, unlikely edge cases)\n- Stylistic preferences that don't match project conventions\n- Adding documentation for self-explanatory code\n\nWhen in doubt, ask the user rather than blindly applying changes.\n\n## Diminishing Returns Detection\n\nTrack review cycles. After 2-3 iterations, evaluate:\n- Are new comments addressing real issues or nitpicks?\n- Are we fixing the same type of issue repeatedly?\n- Is the reviewer finding fewer/lower-priority issues?\n\n**ONE MORE LOOP rule**: When you reach a point where there are no unresolved comments (or only \"Won't fix\" responses), do ONE additional review cycle to catch any final feedback Gemini may have held back.\n\n**Tracking state**: Use TodoWrite to track whether you're in the \"final verification loop\". Create a todo like \"Final verification loop - if no actionable feedback, ready to merge\".\n\n**Reset condition**: If the final verification loop produces feedback you actually fix (not just \"Won't fix\"), remove the \"final verification loop\" todo - you need a fresh \"one more\" after pushing those fixes.\n\n**Exit condition**: If the \"final verification loop\" todo exists AND you get no actionable feedback (only nitpicks/won't-fix responses), you're done - ask about merge.\n\n**After the final loop**, ask the user: \"We've completed the review cycles. Ready to merge, or want to address more?\"\n\n## Autonomous Loop Workflow\n\n**CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE THESE:**\n1. **ALWAYS use `commit-and-push.sh`** - NEVER `git commit` or `git push` (see table at top of document)\n2. **ALWAYS reply to EVERY comment** using `reply-to-comment.sh` - never leave a comment without a reply\n3. **ALWAYS use `--wait` flag** when checking for comments - this ensures proper 5-minute polling\n4. **PR creation automatically triggers Gemini review** - use `get-review-comments.sh --wait` to wait for the first review\n\n### The Loop\n\n```\n1. Get unresolved comments (use --wait to poll for up to 5 minutes)\n2. For EACH comment: fix OR decide to skip, then REPLY using reply-to-comment.sh\n3. Use commit-and-push.sh (NEVER raw git commands)\n4. Trigger next review with --wait: trigger-review.sh <PR> --wait\n5. Go to step 1\n6. When no new unresolved: do ONE MORE loop, then ask user about merge\n```\n\n### Step-by-step\n\n**1. Check for unresolved comments (ALWAYS use --wait for first check after PR creation or push):**\n```bash\nscripts/summarize-reviews.sh <PR>\nscripts/get-review-comments.sh <PR> --with-ids --wait\n```\nThe `--wait` flag polls every 30s for up to 5 minutes, waiting for Gemini to respond. Do NOT skip this or use a shorter timeout.\n\n**2. For EACH unresolved comment (MANDATORY - never skip this):**\n- Evaluate if suggestion is worthwhile\n- Apply fix locally OR decide to skip\n- **ALWAYS reply using the script** - this resolves the thread:\n```bash\nscripts/reply-to-comment.sh <PR> <comment-id> \"Fixed - description\"\n# OR\nscripts/reply-to-comment.sh <PR> <comment-id> \"Won't fix - reason\"\n```\n\n**3. Commit and push (ALWAYS use the script, NEVER raw git):**\n```bash\nscripts/commit-and-push.sh \"fix: description\"\n```\nThis script runs pre-commit, commits with proper footer, and pushes.\n\n**4. Trigger next review and wait for response:**\n```bash\nscripts/trigger-review.sh <PR> --wait\n```\nThe `--wait` flag polls for up to 5 minutes until new comments appear. Do NOT use sleep or manual polling.\n\n**5. When new reviews detected, go to step 1**\n\n## Reply Templates\n\n**ALWAYS reply to every comment using `reply-to-comment.sh`.** Use these templates:\n- Fixed: \"Fixed - [description]\"\n- Won't fix: \"Won't fix - [reason]\"\n- Deferred: \"Good catch, tracking in #issue\"\n- Acknowledged: \"Acknowledged - [explanation]\"\n\n## Triggering Reviews by Bot Type\n\n### Gemini Code Assist (Default)\n```bash\nscripts/trigger-review.sh <PR> --gemini --wait\n```\nGemini has a daily quota. When exceeded, the skill automatically detects this and suggests alternatives.\n\n### Cursor Bugbot\n```bash\nscripts/trigger-review.sh <PR> --cursor --wait\n```\nCursor auto-reviews on push, so `--cursor` just waits for comments to appear (typically 1-2 minutes).\n\n### Claude Agent (Fallback)\n```bash\nscripts/trigger-review.sh <PR> --claude\n```\nUses a Claude agent to review the PR and post comments. Useful when:\n- Gemini is rate-limited\n- You want a different perspective\n- Cursor isn't configured on the repo\n\n### Claude Review Workflow\n\nWhen using Claude fallback:\n\n1. **Run the script to get the prompt:**\n   ```bash\n   scripts/claude-review.sh <PR>\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Task tool with the generated prompt:**\n   ```\n   Task tool:\n     subagent_type: general-purpose\n     description: Review PR #<PR>\n     prompt: (copy from /tmp/claude_review_prompt_<PR>.txt)\n   ```\n\n3. **The agent will post the review as a PR comment**\n\n4. **Continue the normal review loop** - address comments using `reply-to-comment.sh`\n\n## Rate Limit Detection\n\nThe scripts automatically detect Gemini quota limits by checking for:\n> \"You have reached your daily quota limit\"\n\nWhen detected, the script suggests:\n1. Use Cursor if available: `--cursor --wait`\n2. Use Claude fallback: `--claude`\n\n## Scripts\n\n| Script | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|\n| `commit-and-push.sh \"msg\"` | **ALWAYS USE** - Never use raw git commit/push |\n| `reply-to-comment.sh <PR> <id> \"msg\"` | **ALWAYS USE** - Reply and auto-resolve every comment |\n| `get-review-comments.sh <PR> [--with-ids] [--wait]` | **USE --wait** - Fetch comments, polls 5min if --wait |\n| `trigger-review.sh [PR] [--gemini\\|--cursor\\|--claude] [--wait]` | **USE --wait** - Trigger review and poll for response |\n| `summarize-reviews.sh <PR> [--all]` | Summary of unresolved by priority/file |\n| `watch-pr.sh <PR>` | Background monitor (optional, for long-running watches) |\n| `claude-review.sh <PR>` | Generate Claude agent prompt for code review |\n| `check-gemini-quota.sh <PR>` | Check if Gemini is rate-limited |\n| `resolve-comment.sh <node-id> [reason]` | Manually resolve a thread |\n\n## Permission Setup\n\nTo enable autonomous loops, user should grant access:\n```\nBash(scripts/commit-and-push.sh:*)\nBash(scripts/reply-to-comment.sh:*)\nBash(scripts/trigger-review.sh:*)\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- `gh` CLI authenticated\n- `pre-commit` (optional) - If `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists in the repo, pre-commit will be run.\n  If pre-commit is not installed, a warning is shown but commits proceed.\n  Install with: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`"
