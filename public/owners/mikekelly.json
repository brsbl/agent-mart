                "content": "<essential_principles>\nThis skill manages projects that adopt the **promode methodology** — a set of principles and workflows for AI agents to develop software. The methodology emphasises TDD, context conservation, progressive disclosure, and clear delegation patterns.\n\n**1. CLAUDE.md is for main agent behaviour**\nCLAUDE.md defines the main agent's role: conversing with users, delegating to sub-agents, and following the promode methodology. It does NOT contain project-specific technical details — those belong in README.md files.\n\n**2. Sub-agents use the promode-subagent**\nClaude Code sub-agents don't inherit CLAUDE.md. The `promode-subagent` mirrors the same methodology so sub-agents apply the same principles. Main agents delegate to promode-subagent rather than instructing sub-agents to read CLAUDE.md.\n\n**3. README.md files are the knowledge graph**\nEach package/directory can have a README.md with domain-specific context. Agents read these just-in-time when working in that area. This keeps initial context lean while making deep knowledge available.\n\n**4. Tests are the documentation**\nLong-lived markdown should cover architecture and principles only. Detailed behaviour documentation belongs in executable tests. If behaviour isn't tested, it's not guaranteed.\n\n**5. CLAUDE.md is standardised**\nThe standard CLAUDE.md (`standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md`) should be copied exactly into projects. It is designed to work universally. All project-specific content belongs in README.md files.\n</essential_principles>\n\n<never_do>\n- NEVER modify `standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md` content — it must be copied exactly into projects\n- NEVER add project-specific content to CLAUDE.md (use README.md files instead)\n- NEVER duplicate content between CLAUDE.md and README.md — single source of truth\n- NEVER skip verifying CLAUDE.md matches the standard after installation or migration\n</never_do>\n\n<escalation>\nStop and ask the user when:\n- Project is not under git version control or has uncommited changes\n- Content doesn't fit KEEP/MOVE/DELETE categories during migration\n- Existing README.md files conflict with the suggested structure\n- You've attempted the same step 3+ times without success\n- Changes would affect more than 10 files\n</escalation>\n\n<intake>\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1. **Install** — Set up the standard CLAUDE.md in a new project\n2. **Migrate** — Refactor an existing CLAUDE.md, moving content to READMEs\n3. **Audit** — Check if a project follows progressive disclosure principles\n\n**Wait for response before proceeding.**\n</intake>\n\n<routing>\n| Response | Next Action | Workflow |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| 1, \"install\", \"setup\", \"new\", \"create\" | Confirm project path | workflows/install.md |\n| 2, \"migrate\", \"refactor\", \"move\", \"convert\" | Analyze existing CLAUDE.md | workflows/migrate.md |\n| 3, \"audit\", \"check\", \"review\", \"assess\" | Scan project structure | workflows/audit.md |\n\n**Intent-based routing:**\n- \"set up CLAUDE.md\", \"add agent config\" → workflows/install.md\n- \"CLAUDE.md is too big\", \"slim down\", \"refactor\" → workflows/migrate.md\n- \"is this right?\", \"check conformance\" → workflows/audit.md\n\n**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**\n</routing>\n\n<quick_reference>\n**CLAUDE.md**: Copy `standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md` exactly. Do not modify. This configures the main agent with promode methodology.\n\n**Sub-agents**: Main agents delegate to `promode-subagent`, which already knows the methodology.\n\n**README.md distribution:**\n```\nproject/\n├── CLAUDE.md           # Main agent behaviour (promode methodology)\n├── README.md           # Project overview, links to main components of system, etc\n└── docs/\n    └── {feature}/      # Ephemeral planning docs, and task specs\n```\n</quick_reference>\n\n<reference_index>\n- `standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md` — The canonical CLAUDE.md (copy exactly into projects)\n- `references/progressive-disclosure.md` — Why and how to distribute content to READMEs\n- `references/claude-md-sections.md` — Purpose of each CLAUDE.md section\n</reference_index>\n\n<workflows_index>\nAll in `workflows/`:\n\n| Workflow | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| install.md | Install standard CLAUDE.md into new project |\n| migrate.md | Migrate existing CLAUDE.md content to READMEs |\n| audit.md | Audit project for progressive disclosure conformance |\n</workflows_index>\n\n<success_criteria>\nA well-configured project:\n\n- CLAUDE.md is an exact copy of `standard/MAIN_AGENT_CLAUDE.md`\n- README.md at project root with overview and navigation\n- Component README.md files throughout for domain-specific context\n- Tests document system behaviour, not markdown files\n</success_criteria>"
