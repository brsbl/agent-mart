What specific aspects of [topic] are you thinking about?\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Explore Through Questioning\n\nUse Socratic questioning to help the user explore their thinking:\n\n**Question types to use:**\n- Clarifying: \"What makes you think that?\"\n- Exploring consequences: \"What would happen if...?\"\n- Making connections: \"How does this connect to...?\"\n- Finding the core: \"What's the core challenge here?\"\n- Challenging assumptions: \"What assumptions are we making?\"\n- Considering alternatives: \"What other ways could we look at this?\"\n\n**Approach:**\n- Ask open-ended questions that encourage exploration\n- Gently introduce alternative viewpoints or frameworks when appropriate\n- Help identify patterns, themes, or contradictions\n- Probe deeper on interesting threads\n\n### Step 3: Pattern Recognition and Synthesis\n\nAs the conversation develops:\n\n- Identify recurring themes or patterns\n- Point out connections between different ideas\n- Highlight contradictions or tensions that might be worth exploring\n- Periodically summarize to check understanding\n\n**Example synthesis:**\n```\n\"It sounds like there are two main threads here: [theme 1] and [theme 2].\nThey seem to connect around [connection]. Does that resonate?\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Optional Note-Taking\n\n**Ask first** before creating notes files. Only offer when it would add value:\n\n```\n\"Would it be helpful if I capture the key insights from our conversation\nin a notes file you can reference later?\"\n```\n\n**If user agrees**, create a notes file using the template in `assets/thinking-notes-template.md`:\n\n- Use a descriptive filename: `[topic]-exploration-[date].md` or `thinking-notes-[topic].md`\n- Capture key questions, main ideas, connections, and open threads\n- Update organically as the conversation flows\n- Include direct quotes when the user says something particularly insightful\n\n**Note structure:**\n- **Key Questions**: Central problems or questions being explored\n- **Main Ideas**: Core concepts and insights that emerge\n- **Connections**: Links between different ideas or to existing knowledge\n- **Open Threads**: Questions or areas that need further exploration\n- **Action Items**: Concrete next steps (only if they naturally arise)\n\n### Step 5: Close with Reflection\n\nEnd by reflecting back the key insights discovered:\n\n```\n\"Let me summarize what we've explored together:\n- [Key insight 1]\n- [Key insight 2]\n- [Key insight 3]\n\nWhat stands out most to you from this conversation?\"\n```\n\n## Adaptive Questioning Style\n\nAdjust the questioning approach based on how the user thinks:\n\n- **Analytical thinkers**: Use logical frameworks and systematic exploration\n- **Creative thinkers**: Encourage metaphors, analogies, and lateral connections\n- **Practical thinkers**: Focus on concrete examples and real-world applications\n\n## What NOT to Do\n\n- Don't solve the problem for the user - help them find their own solutions\n- Don't create formal presentations, reports, or polished documents\n- Don't push toward premature conclusions or action plans\n- Don't impose rigid frameworks unless specifically requested\n- Don't judge or critique ideas during the exploration phase\n- Don't automatically create notes files - ask first\n\n## Example Interaction\n\n**User**: \"I'm struggling with how to structure my new product launch.\"\n\n**Assistant**: \"Let's explore that together. What aspects of the product launch structure are you finding most challenging right now?\"\n\n**User**: \"I'm not sure whether to focus on a big splash event or gradual rollout.\"\n\n**Assistant**: \"Interesting choice to consider. What makes each approach appealing to you? And what would success look like in either scenario?\"\n\n_[Continue exploring through questions, identifying patterns, and helping the user think through the trade-offs]_\n\n**Assistant**: \"Would it be helpful if I capture the key insights from our conversation in a notes file?\"\n\n**User**: \"Yes, that would be great.\"\n\n_[Create notes file and update as conversation continues]_"

                "content": "# Deep Research Prompt Builder\n\nExpert system for constructing high-quality research prompts through adaptive interviewing and best-practice application.\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n### 1. Categorize Research Topic\n\nWhen user provides a topic, immediately categorize it:\n\n- **Product/Service**: Shopping comparisons, reviews, buying guides\n- **Technical**: Code patterns, architecture, implementation details\n- **Academic**: Literature reviews, theoretical analysis, scientific research\n- **Business**: Market analysis, competitive intelligence, trends\n- **General**: Historical, cultural, educational topics\n\n### 2. Conduct Adaptive Interview\n\nAsk questions ONE AT A TIME. Wait for the response before proceeding.\n\n**Generate questions that directly probe the specific research topic.** Use the category examples below as inspiration, not scripts. Each question should surface something the user has not yet specified about the actual topic.\n\n#### Using AskUserQuestion (Optional Enhancement)\n\nIf the `AskUserQuestion` tool is available, use it to provide a more structured interview experience with clear options. This enhances usability but is not required - fall back to conversational questions if the tool is unavailable.\n\n**When to use AskUserQuestion:**\n- Category-specific questions where there are clear, distinct options\n- Priority ordering questions (when requirements might conflict)\n- Confirmation questions before generating the final prompt\n- Clarifying ambiguous terminology with specific interpretations\n\n**When to use conversational questions:**\n- Open-ended exploration questions\n- Questions that need nuanced, free-form responses\n- Follow-up questions that depend on complex context\n- When the user's answer suggests they need to explain more\n\n#### Clarification Triggers\n\nBefore proceeding with interview questions, clarify when:\n\n- The user uses ambiguous or unusual terminology (use AskUserQuestion with specific interpretation options if available)\n- Scope is mentioned but intent is unclear (what specifically matters about it?)\n- The user gives compound answers - confirm priority ordering (use AskUserQuestion with ordered options if available)\n- Technical terms may have multiple meanings in context\n\n#### Opening Question (All Categories)\n\n\"What specific aspect of [TOPIC] are you most interested in exploring?\"\n\n#### Category-Specific Question Examples\n\nUse these as **inspiration only** - adapt questions to the actual topic at hand:\n\n**Product/Service examples:**\n\n- Research goal: current best options, specific comparisons, or understanding what makes something good?\n- Key criteria and their priority order\n- Preferred output format\n\n*Example with AskUserQuestion (if available):*\n- Question: \"What's your primary goal for this product research?\"\n  - Options: \"Find the best option to buy now\", \"Compare specific products I'm considering\", \"Understand evaluation criteria\", \"General market overview\"\n- Question: \"Which criteria matter most for your decision?\"\n  - Options: \"Price and value\", \"Features and capabilities\", \"Reliability and reviews\", \"Long-term costs\"\n  - multiSelect: true\n\n**Technical examples:**\n\n- Context: learning, implementing, or making architectural decisions?\n- Critical aspects: performance, best practices, pitfalls, examples?\n- Depth needed: overview, implementation guide, or deep analysis?\n\n*Example with AskUserQuestion (if available):*\n- Question: \"What's your context for researching this technical topic?\"\n  - Options: \"Learning the fundamentals\", \"Implementing in a project\", \"Making architectural decisions\", \"Troubleshooting issues\"\n- Question: \"Which aspects are most critical?\"\n  - Options: \"Performance characteristics\", \"Best practices and patterns\", \"Common pitfalls to avoid\", \"Practical examples\"\n  - multiSelect: true\n- Question: \"What depth of coverage do you need?\"\n  - Options: \"High-level overview\", \"Implementation-focused guide\", \"Deep technical analysis\", \"Comprehensive reference\"\n\n**Academic examples:**\n\n- Purpose: literature review, hypothesis exploration, or current knowledge state?\n- Time scope preferences\n- Evidence standards: peer-reviewed only or broader sources?\n\n*Example with AskUserQuestion (if available):*\n- Question: \"What's the purpose of this academic research?\"\n  - Options: \"Comprehensive literature review\", \"Exploring a specific hypothesis\", \"Understanding current state of knowledge\", \"Identifying research gaps\"\n- Question: \"What evidence standards should be applied?\"\n  - Options: \"Peer-reviewed only\", \"Include preprints and working papers\", \"Include reputable non-academic sources\", \"Broad sources for comprehensive view\"\n\n**Business examples:**\n\n- Focus: market landscape, competitor analysis, or trends?\n- Most valuable data types\n- Scope boundaries\n\n**General examples:**\n\n- What's driving this research?\n- Perspective: comprehensive, specific angle, or comparative?\n- Key debates or controversies to address?\n\n#### Closing Question (All)\n\n\"Any specific angle or outcome you haven't mentioned that should shape this research?\"\n\n### 3. Build Enhanced Prompt\n\n#### Prompt Construction Principles\n\n- **Include only what was discussed or directly implied**\n- Do NOT add \"enhancements\" the user didn't ask about\n- If uncertain whether to include something, leave it out\n- Scope mentions (geographic, temporal, etc.) should reflect user's stated intent, not assumed interests\n- No speculative expansions beyond what user requested\n\nUse this template structure:\n\n```\n# Research Objective\n[Clear statement synthesized from topic and clarifications]\n\n# Context and Scope\n- Purpose: [Why this research matters]\n- Boundaries: [Time, geography, domain limits]\n- Focus Areas: [3-5 specific aspects to emphasize]\n\n# Research Requirements\n\n## Investigation Depth\nPrimary questions:\n1. [Main research question]\n2. [Key sub-question 1]\n3. [Key sub-question 2]\n\nSecondary considerations:\n- [Related area if relevant]\n- [Adjacent topic to explore]\n\nExplicitly exclude: [What NOT to research]\n\n## Evidence Standards\n- Source types: [Academic, industry, user-generated, etc.]\n- Recency: [How current sources must be]\n- Credibility: [Minimum authority level]\n- Citations: [How to reference sources]\n\n## Analysis Framework\n[INSERT CATEGORY-SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK - see below]\n\n## Output Structure\n### Required Sections:\n1. Executive Summary (3-5 key findings)\n2. Detailed Analysis by Subtopic\n3. Supporting Evidence with Citations\n4. Practical Implications\n5. Confidence Levels and Limitations\n6. Further Research Needed\n\n### Format Requirements:\n- Hierarchical headings for navigation\n- Data visualization descriptions where helpful\n- Balance depth with readability\n- Include both synthesis and details\n\n# Quality Instructions\n\n## Reasoning Approach\n- Think step-by-step through each research aspect\n- Build from foundational understanding to nuances\n- Explicitly address source contradictions\n- Validate through multiple independent sources\n\n## Critical Evaluation\n- Cross-reference all major claims\n- Distinguish facts from interpretations\n- Note confidence levels for findings\n- Acknowledge information gaps\n\n[Additional topic-specific instructions from interview]\n```\n\n## Category-Specific Frameworks\n\nInsert appropriate framework based on category:\n\n### Product Framework\n\n```\n## Analysis Framework\n- Feature comparison matrix across top options\n- Price-performance analysis\n- Real user experience synthesis\n- Expert review aggregation\n- Long-term value assessment\n- Common issues and solutions\n```\n\n### Technical Framework\n\n```\n## Analysis Framework\n- Implementation complexity assessment\n- Performance and scalability analysis\n- Code examples and patterns\n- Best practices vs anti-patterns\n- Tool ecosystem and dependencies\n- Migration and maintenance considerations\n```\n\n### Academic Framework\n\n```\n## Analysis Framework\n- Theoretical foundations and evolution\n- Methodological approaches comparison\n- Key findings synthesis across studies\n- Debates and controversies mapping\n- Research gaps identification\n- Future direction assessment\n```\n\n### Business Framework\n\n```\n## Analysis Framework\n- Market dynamics and size\n- Competitive landscape mapping\n- Customer segment analysis\n- Growth drivers and barriers\n- Risk and opportunity assessment\n- Strategic recommendations\n```\n\n### General Framework\n\n```\n## Analysis Framework\n- Historical context and evolution\n- Multiple perspective comparison\n- Cultural and societal impacts\n- Current state assessment\n- Future implications\n- Related topic connections\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor complete example prompts across all categories, see `references/example-prompts.md`.\nFor advanced prompting techniques (CoT, self-consistency, role-based framing), see `references/prompt-techniques.md`.\n\n## Prompt Enhancement Techniques\n\nApply these **only when directly relevant to what the user discussed**. Do not add enhancements speculatively.\n\n### For Vague Topics (if user's topic lacks clear boundaries)\n\nAdd: \"Begin by establishing clear definitions and scope based on authoritative consensus, then proceed with focused analysis.\"\n\n### For Controversial Topics (if user mentions debates or conflicting views)\n\nAdd: \"Present multiple viewpoints with supporting evidence. Clearly distinguish between consensus, debate, and speculation.\"\n\n### For Emerging Fields (if user is researching something new/rapidly evolving)\n\nAdd: \"Note the recency of this domain. Prioritize latest developments while acknowledging rapid change and limited long-term data.\"\n\n### For Comparative Research (if user explicitly wants comparisons)\n\nAdd: \"Develop systematic comparison criteria before analysis. Ensure fair, parallel evaluation across all options.\"\n\n### For Technical Implementation (if user needs practical guidance)\n\nAdd: \"Include practical examples, common gotchas, and real-world considerations beyond theoretical knowledge.\"\n\n## Pre-Output Confirmation\n\nBefore generating the final prompt, first output a summary of what was discussed:\n\n\"Based on the discussion, the prompt will focus on:\n\n- [Primary goal]\n- [Key criteria]\n- [Scope boundaries]\"\n\n**Then, if AskUserQuestion is available:**\n\nUse it to confirm next steps:\n- Question: \"Should I proceed with generating the research prompt?\"\n  - Options: \"Yes, generate it\", \"Yes, but add/change something first\", \"Let me review the requirements again\"\n\n**If AskUserQuestion is not available:**\n\nAsk conversationally: \"Anything to add or remove before generating it?\"\n\n## Output Format\n\nAfter confirmation, preface final prompt with:\n\"Here's your enhanced research prompt. Copy and use this for comprehensive deep research:\"\n\n```\n[Complete enhanced prompt in code block for easy copying]\n```\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore outputting, verify the prompt includes:\n\n- [ ] Clear, specific research objective\n- [ ] Defined scope and boundaries\n- [ ] Evidence requirements\n- [ ] Output structure\n- [ ] Reasoning instructions\n- [ ] Quality evaluation criteria\n- [ ] Topic-specific enhancements (only if discussed)\n- [ ] Contains ONLY elements discussed or directly requested\n- [ ] No speculative enhancements added\n\n## Prompt Validation\n\nTo validate the generated prompt contains all required sections, run:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/validate_prompt.py prompt.txt\n```\n\nThe validator checks for required sections, recommended elements, and provides a quality score. Use this before delivering the final prompt to ensure completeness.\n\n## Interaction Guidelines\n\n- Keep questions concise and clear\n- One question at a time for better user experience\n- Use AskUserQuestion tool when available for structured choices (enhances UX but is optional)\n- Skip questions if the user provides information upfront\n- Adapt depth based on user expertise signals\n- If requirements conflict, ask for priority (use AskUserQuestion with ordered options if available)\n- If scope is too broad, suggest splitting into multiple research tasks"

This skill handles the complete workflow from opening the browser to generating the final markdown document.\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Initialize and Navigate\n\n1. Create a todo list to track the extraction process:\n\n   - Open browser and navigate to the tweet URL\n   - Wait for user to log in (if needed)\n   - Extract and expand all tweets in thread\n   - Save all content to .md file\n\n2. Open the browser and navigate to the provided Twitter/X URL using `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`\n\n3. Take a snapshot using `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` to verify the page loaded\n\n### Step 2: User Login Check\n\nCheck the page snapshot for login status:\n\n- If the user is already logged in (profile visible), proceed immediately\n- If login is required, inform the user and wait for login completion\n- Update the todo list to mark the login step as completed once verified\n\n### Step 3: Extract Thread Content\n\n1. Identify all tweets in the thread from the page snapshot\n\n   - Look for article elements containing tweet content\n   - Note which tweets have \"Show more\" buttons (truncated content)\n\n2. Create the initial markdown file with:\n\n   - Thread title/topic\n   - Author information (@username)\n   - Date\n   - Source URL\n   - Introduction section\n\n3. Systematically expand ALL truncated tweets:\n\n   - For each tweet with a \"Show more\" button, click it using `mcp__playwright__browser_click`\n   - Use the element reference from the snapshot\n   - After each click, verify that the content expanded\n   - Extract the full content after expansion\n\n4. Identify and note any attached media:\n\n   - Check for images, videos, or embedded content in each tweet\n   - Note the presence and type of media (e.g., \"Image\", \"Video\", \"Embedded video\")\n   - Extract the media URL if available from link elements\n   - Do NOT attempt to download or extract the actual media files\n\n5. Continue scrolling/clicking through the thread until all tweets are captured\n\n### Step 4: Format and Save\n\n1. Structure the markdown file with proper header and metadata:\n\n   - Add thread title as H1\n   - Include author name and @username\n   - Add date and source URL\n   - Separate metadata from content with `---`\n\n2. Extract thread content sequentially:\n\n   - Extract each tweet in the order it appears in the thread\n   - Preserve all formatting (bold, italics, code blocks, lists)\n   - Keep emoji characters intact\n   - Note attached media inline with the tweet content (see \"Media Handling\")\n   - Separate tweets with `---` for readability\n   - Do NOT reorganize or create artificial sections\n\n3. Save the complete content to a markdown file with a descriptive filename\n\n4. Update the todo list to mark extraction as completed\n\n5. Close the browser using `mcp__playwright__browser_close`\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n### Content Preservation\n\n- Preserve all original formatting (bold, italics, code blocks)\n- Keep emoji characters intact\n- Maintain line breaks and paragraph structure\n- Include all links, mentions, and hashtags\n\n### Tweet Organization\n\n- Extract tweets in sequential order as they appear\n- Separate each tweet with `---` (horizontal rule)\n- Preserve the original text formatting\n- Use code blocks (```) only if present in the original tweet\n- Do NOT add headings or section titles that weren't in the original thread\n\n### File Naming\n\n- Use descriptive, readable names\n- Replace spaces with underscores or hyphens\n- Keep it concise but informative\n- Example: `twitter_thread_prompting_techniques.md`\n\n### Media Handling\n\nWhen a tweet contains attached media:\n\n- Note the media type inline: `[Image]`, `[Video]`, or `[Embedded video]`\n- If the media has a direct URL, include it as a markdown link: `[Image](URL)`\n- Place media notes after the tweet text content\n- For multiple images, note each one: `[Image 1](URL)`, `[Image 2](URL)`\n- Example:\n\n  ```markdown\n  This is the tweet text explaining the concept.\n\n  [Image](https://x.com/username/status/123456/photo/1)\n  ```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always expand truncated content**: Never save partial tweets - click all \"Show more\" buttons\n\n2. **Verify completeness**: Check that the thread has no more tweets after the last one captured\n\n3. **Maintain structure**: Preserve the logical flow and organization of the original thread\n\n4. **Clean formatting**: Remove Twitter UI artifacts, focus on pure content\n\n5. **Todo tracking**: Update the todo list after completing each major step to show progress\n\n6. **Handle errors gracefully**: If a tweet fails to expand, note it and try again\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe extracted thread should follow this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# [Thread Title/Topic]\n\n**Author:** [Name] (@username)\n**Date:** [Date]\n**Source:** [URL]\n\n---\n\n[Tweet 1 text content]\n\n[Media if present]\n\n---\n\n[Tweet 2 text content]\n\n[Media if present]\n\n---\n\n[Tweet 3 text content]\n\n...\n```\n\nEach tweet is extracted verbatim with its media noted, separated by horizontal rules for readability."
